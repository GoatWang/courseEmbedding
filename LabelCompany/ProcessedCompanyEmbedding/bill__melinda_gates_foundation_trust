way sue desmondhellmann ceo how we work to bring about the kinds of changes that will help people live healthier and more productive lives we seek to understand the world’s inequities whether the challenge is lowyield crops in africa or low graduation rates in los angeles we listen and learn so we can identify pressing problems that get too little attention then we consider whether we can make a meaningful difference with our influence and our investments whether it is a grant or a contract all of our strategies—more than two dozen across the foundation—have emerged through this process of identifying what we want to accomplish for people and where we can have the greatest impact once we commit to an area of need we define our major goals and identify a clear path to achieving them how we work with the field the issues we engage in are wildly disparate but they share the characteristics of being deeply rooted dynamic and complex none will be solved easily and quickly and none will be solved through our efforts alone we do all of our work in collaboration with grantees and other partners who join with us in taking risks pushing for new solutions and harnessing the transformative power of science and technology we strive to engage with our grantees and partners in a spirit of trust candid communication and transparency our collective efforts also depend on the support and resources of governments the private sector communities and individuals how we develop strategy in each of our divisions we develop goals and strategies before allocating resources and making investments we continually collect and share data on our progress reflect on lessons learned and make course corrections as needed essential to this process is ongoing dialogue with our grantees and partners—which is embedded throughout our strategy lifecycle at this stage of the foundation’s growth our divisions and strategies are already in place we reflect on and review each strategy annually and make adjustments to our implementation plan toward achieving our goals how we make investments within each strategy which has an allocation of resources we collaborate with grantee and partner organizations to develop proposals that align with our strategic priorities and the organization’s focus and capabilities an important part of this process is reaching agreement on what success will look like for the investment we use a standard fourphase process to develop all of our grants and contracts the duration of each phase depends on the complexity of the project as well as the capacity and geographic location of the prospective partner phase  concept development our program officers work to identify ideas that support our strategic priorities in consultation with foundation colleagues researchers policymakers and other partners in the field  this phase concludes with an internal decision that a concept is aligned to a strategy and we should proceed with development work phase  preproposal we use a variety of ways to explore and refine concepts with the help of organizations in the field regardless of the approach we remain committed to understanding the perspective of others in order to further shape the proposed body of work this phase ends with the decision to solicit a grant or contract proposal direct solicitation when we know that an organization is wellsuited to perform the work we directly solicit an early phase concept memo or proposal discussion in some cases we invite one or more organizations to discuss the concept with us and explore their interest and their capacity to undertake the work if the organization has the expertise capacity and interest we will invite them to submit a concept memo or proposal request for proposal rfp when we want to broaden our network or fund multiple organizations for a project we may issue an rfp public rfps are posted on our website private rfps are directed to specific organizations  phase  investment developmentwe give applicants guidelines and templates for developing a proposal a budget and a results framework and tracker a program officer reviews submitted materials with internal and at times external experts and works with the applicant to integrate recommended changes we also complete our due diligence confirm the applicant organization’s tax status determine how to structure the transaction and assess risk our legal and financial analysis teams may also participate during this phase investment proposals are reviewed at various levels with more levels of review for grants and contracts that are more complex a foundation executive makes the final decision about whether to fund the proposed grant or contract before funded activities can commence the foundation and the partner organization sign an agreement that includes intended results targets milestones or reporting deliverables and a payment schedule phase  management and close during the life of an investment the program officer and partner discuss how they will work together and keep in close communication to understand progress and challenges of ongoing work by maintaining quality interactions and clear and consistent communication they are able to share feedback early and often occasionally a program officer or foundation staff member will participate on advisory committees and occasionally take a seat on the board of the organization at the end of the project the partner will work with the program officer to submit a final report that summarizes the results achieved and lessons learned how we structure grants we structure grants in a way that makes sense from a financial perspective while also funding partners for the cost of delivering results supported by open and honest dialogue about the resources required as grant proposals are developed we try to gain a complete and accurate understanding of the total cost to execute the project efficiently and effectively in order to expedite global health research and to develop sustainable research capacity the bill  melinda gates foundation periodically reviews its funding model to universities and other research partners it is important to us that our grantees understand our current funding model as it relates to the different approaches taken by other funders foundations have flexibility in accounting for facilities and administrative fa or “indirect costs” as “direct costs” unlike the federal government for example project management lab charges and datait charges that are related to a specific project are allowable as direct costs in a gates foundation grant thus item by item analysis is required to accurately compare a gates foundation grant versus a grant funded by another entity details regarding our grantee indirect cost policy can be found here  how we measure and evaluate results from the outset of the grantmaking process we work with partners to define the overall results we hope to achieve and the data needed to measure those results we call this approach outcome investing to give our partners flexibility in how they achieve results we do not require them to report on all of their activities instead we focus on purposefully measuring the most critical metrics of progress that support continued learning adjustment and alignment however the nature and frequency of measurement depends on the type of work for example scientific research projects may be measured differently than efforts to expand vaccine coverage watch this video for more information on our outcome investing approach evaluation is another collaborative learning tool that provides us and our partners with feedback so we can improve adjust and decide how best to achieve outcomes we work to ensure that our partners have the capacity and support to generate quality evidence our foundation evaluation policy sets out parameters for evaluation and explains how and why we use evaluation and where variation is warranted we acknowledge the ongoing debate about evaluation methods in many fields in which we work we avoid onesizefitsall prescriptions and strive to make selective highquality evaluation an

launched in mid as a learning initiative and became a fullfledged program under the global development division in early  the foundation has since  undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research experimentation reflection advocacy and field implementation in  the foundation decided to refocus its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor using nonpiped sanitation services ie without the use of sewers and less on water supply this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments in mid  the foundation announced in its new water sanitation hygiene strategy overview that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation particularly in subsaharan africa and south asia because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions their grantmaking focus has been since  on sanitation science and technology transformative technologies delivery models at scale urban sanitation markets building demand for sanitation measurement and evaluation as well as policy advocacy and communications in mid  the foundation stated that they had committed more than us million to the water sanitation and hygiene sector over the past five years

order of  usd for their first phase followed by typically  million usd for their second phase many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge the reinvent the toilet challenge is focused on reinventing the flush toilet the aim was to create a toilet that not only removes pathogens from human excreta but also recovers resources such as energy clean water and nutrients a concept also known as reuse of excreta it should operate offthegrid without connections to water sewer or electrical networks finally it should costs less than  uscents per user per day hightech toilets for tackling the growing public health problem of human waste are gaining increasing attention but this focus on a technology fix has also been criticized by many in the sector however lowtech solutions may be more practical in poor countries and research is also funded by the foundation for such toilets the reinvent the toilet challenge is a longterm research and development effort to develop a hygienic standalone toilet this challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying called by the foundation the omniingestor and fecal sludge processing called omniprocessor the aim of the omni processor is to convert excreta for example fecal sludge into beneficial products such as energy

fight aids tuberculosis and malaria the foundation has donated more than  billion for global health programs including over us billion donated as of  on malaria alone greatly increasing the dollars spent per year on malaria research before the gates efforts on malaria malaria drugmakers had largely given up on producing drugs to fight the disease and the foundation is the worlds largest donor to research on diseases of the poor with the help of gatesfunded vaccination drives deaths from measles in africa have dropped by  percent since  the foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of aids tuberculosis and malaria protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases however a  investigation by the los angeles times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundations allocation of aid first subsaharan africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the gates foundation but by pouring most contributions into the fight against such highprofile killers as aids gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained higherpaid clinicians diverting staff from basic care in subsaharan africa this brain drain adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers second the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation third gatesfunded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent in response the gates foundation has said that african governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars that the foundation has donated at least  million to help improve nutrition and agriculture in africa in addition to its diseaserelated initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in africa both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to bill gatess personal views within the gates foundation insufficient internal debate and pervasive group think critics also complain that gates foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence critics have suggested that gates approach to global health and agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies in which gates invests over the interests of the people of developing countries the global health programs other significant grants include polio eradication in  the foundation provided us million toward efforts attempting to eradicate

education policies at both the k and college levels including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to senioritybased layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers unions it spent  million on education in  it has also donated to the two largest national teachers unions the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative one of the foundations goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the united states and the organization has funded reimagining aid design and delivery grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students with a goal of increasing graduation rates one of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster but that idea has received some pushback from organizations of universities and colleges as part of its educationrelated initiatives the foundation has funded journalists think tanks lobbying organizations and governments millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education including more than  million to the education writers association to fund training for journalists who cover education while some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees who have editorial independence union activists in chicago have accused gates foundation grantee teach plus which was founded by new teachers and advocates against senioritybased layoffs of astroturfing the k and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals parents and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support gates predetermined policy preferences several gatesbacked policies such as small schools charter schools and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance examples of some of the k reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students teachers and schools and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores critics also believe that the gates foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers  some of the foundations educational initiatives have included smaller schools the gates foundation claims one in five students is unable to read and grasp the contents of what they read and african american and latino students are graduating high school with the skills of a middle school student gates foundation has invested more than us million in grants to create new

achievement and has unfairly demonized teachers for poor achievement by underprivileged students they contend that the gates foundation should be embracing antipoverty and living wage policies rather than pursuing untested and empirically unsupported education reforms critics say that gatesbacked reforms such as increasing the use of technology in education may financially benefit microsoft and the gates family the foundation trust invests undistributed assets with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment as a result its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the foundation is attempting to relieve poverty these include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that

treatment and reuse play media the gates foundation created this video to advocate for increased innovation for toilets and everything they are connected to example for technology innovation the offgrid nano membrane toilet of cranfield university  prototype on display at reinvent the toilet fair in delhi india the water sanitation and hygiene wash program of the bill  melinda gates foundation was launched in mid as a learning initiative and became a fullfledged program under the global development division in early  the foundation has since  undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research experimentation reflection advocacy and field implementation in  the foundation decided to refocus its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor using nonpiped sanitation services ie without the use of sewers and less on water supply this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments in mid  the foundation announced in its new water sanitation hygiene strategy overview that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation particularly in subsaharan africa and south asia because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions their grantmaking focus has been since  on sanitation science and technology transformative technologies delivery models at scale urban sanitation markets building demand for sanitation measurement and evaluation as well as policy advocacy and communications in mid  the foundation stated that they had committed more than us million to the water sanitation and hygiene sector over the past five years

involved grants of us each in the first round both funding schemes explicitly excluded project ideas that relied on centralized sewerage systems or are not compatible with development country contexts microbial fuel cell stack that converts urine into electricity research by university of the west of england uk since the launch of the reinvent the toilet challenge more than a dozen research teams mainly at universities in the us europe india china and south africa have received grants to develop innovative onsite and offsite waste treatment solutions for the urban poor the grants were in the order of  usd for their first phase followed by typically  million usd for their second phase many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge the reinvent the toilet challenge is focused on reinventing the flush toilet the aim was to create a toilet that not only removes pathogens from human excreta but also recovers resources such as energy clean water and nutrients a concept also known as reuse of excreta it should operate offthegrid without connections to water sewer or electrical networks finally it should costs less than  uscents per user per day hightech toilets for tackling the growing public health problem of human waste are gaining increasing attention but this focus on a technology fix has also been criticized by many in the sector however lowtech solutions may be more practical in poor countries and research is also funded by the foundation for such toilets the reinvent the toilet challenge is a longterm research and development effort to develop a hygienic standalone toilet this challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying called by the foundation the omniingestor and fecal sludge processing called omniprocessor the aim of the omni processor is to convert excreta for example fecal sludge into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients with the potential to develop local business and revenue examples of transformative technologies researchedit about  sanitation projects in many different countries and at various scales  some with a technology focus some with a focus on market development or policy and advocacy have received funding by the foundation since  the university of kwazulunatal in durban south africa

fight aids tuberculosis and malaria the foundation has donated more than  billion for global health programs including over us billion donated as of  on malaria alone greatly increasing the dollars spent per year on malaria research before the gates efforts on malaria malaria drugmakers had largely given up on producing drugs to fight the disease and the foundation is the worlds largest donor to research on diseases of the poor with the help of gatesfunded vaccination drives deaths from measles in africa have dropped by  percent since  the foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of aids tuberculosis and malaria protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases however a  investigation by the los angeles times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundations allocation of aid first subsaharan africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the gates foundation but by pouring most contributions into the fight against such highprofile killers as aids gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained higherpaid clinicians diverting staff from basic care in subsaharan africa this brain drain adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers second the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation third gatesfunded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent in response the gates foundation has said that african governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars that the foundation has donated at least  million to help improve nutrition and agriculture in africa in addition to its diseaserelated initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in africa both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to bill gatess personal views within the gates foundation insufficient internal debate and pervasive group think critics also complain that gates foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence critics have suggested that gates approach to global health and agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies in which gates invests over the interests of the people of developing countries the global health programs other significant grants include polio eradication in  the foundation provided us million toward efforts attempting to eradicate

education policies at both the k and college levels including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to senioritybased layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers unions it spent  million on education in  it has also donated to the two largest national teachers unions the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative one of the foundations goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the united states and the organization has funded reimagining aid design and delivery grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students with a goal of increasing graduation rates one of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster but that idea has received some pushback from organizations of universities and colleges as part of its educationrelated initiatives the foundation has funded journalists think tanks lobbying organizations and governments millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education including more than  million to the education writers association to fund training for journalists who cover education while some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees who have editorial independence union activists in chicago have accused gates foundation grantee teach plus which was founded by new teachers and advocates against senioritybased layoffs of astroturfing the k and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals parents and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support gates predetermined policy preferences several gatesbacked policies such as small schools charter schools and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance examples of some of the k reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students teachers and schools and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores critics also believe that the gates foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers  some of the foundations educational initiatives have included smaller schools the gates foundation claims one in five students is unable to read and grasp the contents of what they read and african american and latino students are graduating high school with the skills of a middle school student gates foundation has invested more than us million in grants to create new

offgrid nano membrane toilet of cranfield university  prototype on display at reinvent the toilet fair in delhi india the water sanitation and hygiene wash program of the bill  melinda gates foundation was launched in mid as a learning initiative and became a fullfledged program under the global development division in early  the foundation has since  undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research experimentation reflection advocacy and field implementation in  the foundation decided to refocus its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor using nonpiped sanitation services ie without the use of sewers and less on water supply this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments in mid  the foundation announced in its new water sanitation hygiene strategy overview that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation particularly in subsaharan africa and south asia because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions their grantmaking focus has been since  on sanitation science and technology transformative technologies delivery models at scale urban sanitation markets building demand for sanitation measurement and evaluation as well as policy advocacy and communications in mid  the foundation stated that they had committed more than us million to the water sanitation and hygiene sector over the past five years

millennium development goal mdg relating to drinking water and sanitation about one billion people have no sanitation facility whatsoever and continue to defecate in gutters behind bushes or in open

microbial fuel cell stack that converts urine into electricity research by university of the west of england uk since the launch of the reinvent the toilet challenge more than a dozen research teams mainly at universities in the us europe india china and south africa have received grants to develop innovative onsite and offsite waste treatment solutions for the urban poor the grants were in the order of  usd for their first phase followed by typically  million usd for their second phase many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge the reinvent the toilet challenge is focused on reinventing the flush toilet the aim was to create a toilet that not only removes pathogens from human excreta but also recovers resources such as energy clean water and nutrients a concept also known as reuse of excreta it should operate offthegrid without connections to water sewer or electrical networks finally it should costs less than  uscents per user per day hightech toilets for tackling the growing public health problem of human waste are gaining increasing attention but this focus on a technology fix has also been criticized by many in the sector however lowtech solutions may be more practical in poor countries and research is also funded by the foundation for such toilets the reinvent the toilet challenge is a longterm research and development effort to develop a hygienic standalone toilet this challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying called by the foundation the omniingestor and fecal sludge processing called omniprocessor the aim of the omni processor is to convert excreta for example fecal sludge into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients with the potential to develop local business and revenue examples of transformative technologies researchedit about  sanitation projects in many different countries and at various

fight aids tuberculosis and malaria the foundation has donated more than  billion for global health programs including over us billion donated as of  on malaria alone greatly increasing the dollars spent per year on malaria research before the gates efforts on malaria malaria drugmakers had largely given up on producing drugs to fight the disease and the foundation is the worlds largest donor to research on diseases of the poor with the help of gatesfunded vaccination drives deaths from measles in africa have dropped by  percent since  the foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of aids tuberculosis and malaria protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases however a  investigation by the los angeles times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundations allocation of aid first subsaharan africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the gates foundation but by pouring most contributions into the fight against such highprofile killers as aids gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained higherpaid clinicians diverting staff from basic care in subsaharan africa this brain drain adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers second the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation third gatesfunded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent in response the gates foundation has said that african governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars that the foundation has donated at least  million to help improve nutrition and agriculture in africa in addition to its diseaserelated initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in africa both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to bill gatess personal views within the gates foundation insufficient internal debate and pervasive group think critics also complain that gates foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence critics have suggested that gates approach to global health and agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies in which gates invests over the interests of the people of developing countries the global health programs other significant grants include polio eradication in  the foundation provided us million toward efforts attempting to eradicate

education policies at both the k and college levels including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to senioritybased layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers unions it spent  million on education in  it has also donated to the two largest national teachers unions the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative one of the foundations goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the united states and the organization has funded reimagining aid design and delivery grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students with a goal of increasing graduation rates one of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster but that idea has received some pushback from organizations of universities and colleges as part of its educationrelated initiatives the foundation has funded journalists think tanks lobbying organizations and governments millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education including more than  million to the education writers association to fund training for journalists who cover education while some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees who have editorial independence union activists in chicago have accused gates foundation grantee teach plus which was founded by new teachers and advocates against senioritybased layoffs of astroturfing the k and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals parents and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support gates predetermined policy preferences several gatesbacked policies such as small schools charter schools and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance examples of some of the k reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students teachers and schools and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores critics also believe that the gates foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers  some of the foundations educational initiatives have included smaller schools the gates foundation claims one in five students is unable to read and grasp the contents of what they read and african american and latino students are graduating high school with the skills of a middle school student gates foundation has invested more than us million in grants to create new

achievement and has unfairly demonized teachers for poor achievement by underprivileged students they contend that the gates foundation should be embracing antipoverty and living wage policies rather than pursuing untested and empirically unsupported education reforms critics say that gatesbacked reforms such as increasing the use of technology in education may financially benefit microsoft and the gates family the foundation trust invests undistributed assets with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment as a result its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the foundation is attempting to relieve poverty these include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that

stood by its policy of investing for maximum return while using voting rights to influence company practices lifespanedit in october  the bill  melinda gates foundation was split into two entities the

treatment and reuse play media the gates foundation created this video to advocate for increased innovation for toilets and everything they are connected to example for technology innovation the offgrid nano membrane toilet of cranfield university  prototype on display at reinvent the toilet fair in delhi india the water sanitation and hygiene wash program of the bill  melinda gates foundation was launched in mid as a learning initiative and became a fullfledged program under the global development division in early  the foundation has since  undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research experimentation reflection advocacy and field implementation in  the foundation decided to refocus its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor using nonpiped sanitation services ie without the use of sewers and less on water supply this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments in mid  the foundation announced in its new water sanitation hygiene strategy overview that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation particularly in subsaharan africa and south asia because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions their grantmaking focus has been since  on sanitation science and technology transformative technologies delivery models at scale urban sanitation markets building demand for sanitation measurement and evaluation as well as policy advocacy and communications in mid  the foundation stated that they had committed more than us million to the water sanitation and hygiene sector over the past five years

involved grants of us each in the first round both funding schemes explicitly excluded project ideas that relied on centralized sewerage systems or are not compatible with development country contexts microbial fuel cell stack that converts urine into electricity research by university of the west of england uk since the launch of the reinvent the toilet challenge more than a dozen research teams mainly at universities in the us europe india china and south africa have received grants to develop innovative onsite and offsite waste treatment solutions for the urban poor the grants were in the order of  usd for their first phase followed by typically  million usd for their second phase many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge the reinvent the toilet challenge is focused on reinventing the flush toilet the aim was to create a toilet that not only removes pathogens from human excreta but also recovers resources such as energy clean water and nutrients a concept also known as reuse of excreta it should operate offthegrid without connections to water sewer or electrical networks finally it should costs less than  uscents per user per day hightech toilets for tackling the growing public health problem of human waste are gaining increasing attention but this focus on a technology fix has also been criticized by many in the sector however lowtech solutions may be more practical in poor countries and research is also funded by the foundation for such toilets the reinvent the toilet challenge is a longterm research and development effort to develop a hygienic standalone toilet this challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying called by the foundation the omniingestor and fecal sludge processing called omniprocessor the aim of the omni processor is to convert excreta for example fecal sludge into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients with the potential to develop local business and revenue examples of transformative technologies researchedit about  sanitation projects in many different countries and at various scales  some with a technology focus some with a focus on market development or policy and advocacy have received funding by the foundation since  the university of kwazulunatal in durban south africa

fight aids tuberculosis and malaria the foundation has donated more than  billion for global health programs including over us billion donated as of  on malaria alone greatly increasing the dollars spent per year on malaria research before the gates efforts on malaria malaria drugmakers had largely given up on producing drugs to fight the disease and the foundation is the worlds largest donor to research on diseases of the poor with the help of gatesfunded vaccination drives deaths from measles in africa have dropped by  percent since  the foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of aids tuberculosis and malaria protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases however a  investigation by the los angeles times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundations allocation of aid first subsaharan africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the gates foundation but by pouring most contributions into the fight against such highprofile killers as aids gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained higherpaid clinicians diverting staff from basic care in subsaharan africa this brain drain adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers second the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation third gatesfunded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent in response the gates foundation has said that african governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars that the foundation has donated at least  million to help improve nutrition and agriculture in africa in addition to its diseaserelated initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in africa both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to bill gatess personal views within the gates foundation insufficient internal debate and pervasive group think critics also complain that gates foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence critics have suggested that gates approach to global health and agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies in which gates invests over the interests of the people of developing countries the global health programs other significant grants include polio eradication in  the foundation provided us million toward efforts attempting to eradicate

education policies at both the k and college levels including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to senioritybased layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers unions it spent  million on education in  it has also donated to the two largest national teachers unions the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative one of the foundations goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the united states and the organization has funded reimagining aid design and delivery grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students with a goal of increasing graduation rates one of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster but that idea has received some pushback from organizations of universities and colleges as part of its educationrelated initiatives the foundation has funded journalists think tanks lobbying organizations and governments millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education including more than  million to the education writers association to fund training for journalists who cover education while some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees who have editorial independence union activists in chicago have accused gates foundation grantee teach plus which was founded by new teachers and advocates against senioritybased layoffs of astroturfing the k and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals parents and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support gates predetermined policy preferences several gatesbacked policies such as small schools charter schools and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance examples of some of the k reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students teachers and schools and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores critics also believe that the gates foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers  some of the foundations educational initiatives have included smaller schools the gates foundation claims one in five students is unable to read and grasp the contents of what they read and african american and latino students are graduating high school with the skills of a middle school student gates foundation has invested more than us million in grants to create new

achievement and has unfairly demonized teachers for poor achievement by underprivileged students they contend that the gates foundation should be embracing antipoverty and living wage policies rather than pursuing untested and empirically unsupported education reforms critics say that gatesbacked reforms such as increasing the use of technology in education may financially benefit microsoft and

offgrid nano membrane toilet of cranfield university  prototype on display at reinvent the toilet fair in delhi india the water sanitation and hygiene wash program of the bill  melinda gates foundation was launched in mid as a learning initiative and became a fullfledged program under the global development division in early  the foundation has since  undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research experimentation reflection advocacy and field implementation in  the foundation decided to refocus its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor using nonpiped sanitation services ie without the use of sewers and less on water supply this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments in mid  the foundation announced in its new water sanitation hygiene strategy overview that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation particularly in subsaharan africa and south asia because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions their grantmaking focus has been since  on sanitation science and technology transformative technologies delivery models at scale urban sanitation markets building demand for sanitation measurement and evaluation as well as policy advocacy and communications in mid  the foundation stated that they had committed more than us million to the water sanitation and hygiene sector over the past five years

millennium development goal mdg relating to drinking water and sanitation about one billion people have no sanitation facility whatsoever and continue to defecate in gutters behind bushes or in open

microbial fuel cell stack that converts urine into electricity research by university of the west of england uk since the launch of the reinvent the toilet challenge more than a dozen research teams mainly at universities in the us europe india china and south africa have received grants to develop innovative onsite and offsite waste treatment solutions for the urban poor the grants were in the order of  usd for their first phase followed by typically  million usd for their second phase many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge the reinvent the toilet challenge is focused on reinventing the flush toilet the aim was to create a toilet that not only removes pathogens from human excreta but also recovers resources such as energy clean water and nutrients a concept also known as reuse of excreta it should operate offthegrid without connections to water sewer or electrical networks finally it should costs less than  uscents per user per day hightech toilets for tackling the growing public health problem of human waste are gaining increasing attention but this focus on a technology fix has also been criticized by many in the sector however lowtech solutions may be more practical in poor countries and research is also funded by the foundation for such toilets the reinvent the toilet challenge is a longterm research and development effort to develop a hygienic standalone toilet this challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying called by the foundation the omniingestor and fecal sludge processing called omniprocessor the aim of the omni processor is to convert excreta for example fecal sludge into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients with the potential to develop local business and revenue examples of transformative technologies researchedit about  sanitation projects in many different countries and at various

fight aids tuberculosis and malaria the foundation has donated more than  billion for global health programs including over us billion donated as of  on malaria alone greatly increasing the dollars spent per year on malaria research before the gates efforts on malaria malaria drugmakers had largely given up on producing drugs to fight the disease and the foundation is the worlds largest donor to research on diseases of the poor with the help of gatesfunded vaccination drives deaths from measles in africa have dropped by  percent since  the foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of aids tuberculosis and malaria protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases however a  investigation by the los angeles times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundations allocation of aid first subsaharan africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the gates foundation but by pouring most contributions into the fight against such highprofile killers as aids gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained higherpaid clinicians diverting staff from basic care in subsaharan africa this brain drain adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers second the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation third gatesfunded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent in response the gates foundation has said that african governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars that the foundation has donated at least  million to help improve nutrition and agriculture in africa in addition to its diseaserelated initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in africa both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to bill gatess personal views within the gates foundation insufficient internal debate and pervasive group think critics also complain that gates foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence critics have suggested that gates approach to global health and agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies in which gates invests over the interests of the people of developing countries the global health programs other significant grants include polio eradication in  the foundation provided us million toward efforts attempting to eradicate

education policies at both the k and college levels including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to senioritybased layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers unions it spent  million on education in  it has also donated to the two largest national teachers unions the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative one of the foundations goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the united states and the organization has funded reimagining aid design and delivery grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students with a goal of increasing graduation rates one of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster but that idea has received some pushback from organizations of universities and colleges as part of its educationrelated initiatives the foundation has funded journalists think tanks lobbying organizations and governments millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education including more than  million to the education writers association to fund training for journalists who cover education while some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees who have editorial independence union activists in chicago have accused gates foundation grantee teach plus which was founded by new teachers and advocates against senioritybased layoffs of astroturfing the k and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals parents and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support gates predetermined policy preferences several gatesbacked policies such as small schools charter schools and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance examples of some of the k reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students teachers and schools and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores critics also believe that the gates foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers  some of the foundations educational initiatives have included smaller schools the gates foundation claims one in five students is unable to read and grasp the contents of what they read and african american and latino students are graduating high school with the skills of a middle school student gates foundation has invested more than us million in grants to create new

achievement and has unfairly demonized teachers for poor achievement by underprivileged students they contend that the gates foundation should be embracing antipoverty and living wage policies rather than pursuing untested and empirically unsupported education reforms critics say that gatesbacked reforms such as increasing the use of technology in education may financially benefit microsoft and the gates family the foundation trust invests undistributed assets with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment as a result its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the foundation is attempting to relieve poverty these include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that

stood by its policy of investing for maximum return while using voting rights to influence company practices lifespanedit in october  the bill  melinda gates foundation was split into two entities the

used by the gates foundation to illustrate their approach to sanitation showing collection transport treatment and reuse play media the gates foundation created this video to advocate for increased innovation for toilets and everything they are connected to example for technology innovation the offgrid nano membrane toilet of cranfield university  prototype on display at reinvent the toilet fair in delhi india the water sanitation and hygiene wash program of the bill  melinda gates foundation was launched in mid as a learning initiative and became a fullfledged program under the global development division in early  the foundation has since  undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research experimentation reflection advocacy and field implementation in  the foundation decided to refocus its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor using nonpiped sanitation services ie without the use of sewers and less on water supply this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments in mid  the foundation announced in its new water sanitation hygiene strategy overview that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation particularly in subsaharan africa and south asia because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions their grantmaking focus has been since  on sanitation science and technology transformative technologies delivery models at scale urban sanitation markets building demand for sanitation measurement and evaluation as well as policy advocacy and communications in mid  the foundation stated that they had committed more than us million to the water sanitation and hygiene sector over the past five years ie since about  for the time period of about  to mid  all grants awarded to water sanitation and hygiene projects totaled

sewerage systems or are not compatible with development country contexts microbial fuel cell stack that converts urine into electricity research by university of the west of england uk since the launch of the reinvent the toilet challenge more than a dozen research teams mainly at universities in the us europe india china and south africa have received grants to develop innovative onsite and offsite waste treatment solutions for the urban poor the grants were in the order of  usd for their first phase followed by typically  million usd for their second phase many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge the reinvent the toilet challenge is focused on reinventing the flush toilet the aim was to create a toilet that not only removes pathogens from human excreta but also recovers resources such as energy clean water and nutrients a concept also known as reuse of excreta it should operate offthegrid without connections to water sewer or electrical networks finally it should costs less than  uscents per user per day hightech toilets for tackling the growing public health problem of human waste are gaining increasing attention but this focus on a technology fix has also been criticized by many in the sector however lowtech solutions may be more practical in poor countries and research is also funded by the foundation for such toilets the reinvent the toilet challenge is a longterm research and development effort to develop a hygienic standalone toilet this challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying called by the foundation the omniingestor and fecal sludge processing called omniprocessor the aim of the omni processor is to convert excreta for example fecal sludge into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients with the potential to develop local business and revenue examples of transformative

programs including over us billion donated as of  on malaria alone greatly increasing the dollars spent per year on malaria research before the gates efforts on malaria malaria drugmakers had largely given up on producing drugs to fight the disease and the foundation is the worlds largest donor to research on diseases of the poor with the help of gatesfunded vaccination drives deaths from measles in africa have dropped by  percent since  the foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of aids tuberculosis and malaria protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases however a  investigation by the los angeles times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundations allocation of aid first subsaharan africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the gates foundation but by pouring most contributions into the fight against such highprofile killers as aids gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained higherpaid clinicians diverting staff from basic care in subsaharan africa this brain drain adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers second the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation third gatesfunded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent in response the gates foundation has said that african governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars that the foundation has donated at least  million to help improve nutrition and agriculture in africa in addition to its diseaserelated initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in africa both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to bill gatess personal views within the gates foundation insufficient internal debate and pervasive group think critics also complain that gates foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence critics have suggested that gates approach to global health and agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies in which gates invests over the interests of the people of developing countries the global health programs other significant grants

educationedit a key aspect of the gates foundations us efforts involves an overhaul of the countrys education policies at both the k and college levels including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to senioritybased layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers unions it spent  million on education in  it has also donated to the two largest national teachers unions the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative one of the foundations goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the united states and the organization has funded reimagining aid design and delivery grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students with a goal of increasing graduation rates one of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster but that idea has received some pushback from organizations of universities and colleges as part of its educationrelated initiatives the foundation has funded journalists think tanks lobbying organizations and governments millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education including more than  million to the education writers association to fund training for journalists who cover education while some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees who have editorial independence union activists in chicago have accused gates foundation grantee teach plus which was founded by new teachers and advocates against senioritybased layoffs of astroturfing the k and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals parents and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support gates predetermined policy preferences several gatesbacked policies such as small schools charter schools and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance examples of some of the k reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students teachers and schools and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores critics also believe that the gates foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers  some of the foundations educational initiatives have included smaller schools the gates foundation claims one in five students is unable to read and grasp the contents of what they read and african american and latino students are graduating high school with the skills of a middle school student gates foundation has invested more than us million in grants to create new small schools reduce studenttoteacher ratios and to divide up large high schools through the

the bill  melinda gates foundation has overlooked the links between poverty and poor academic achievement and has unfairly demonized teachers for poor achievement by underprivileged students they contend that the gates foundation should be embracing antipoverty and living wage policies rather than pursuing untested and empirically unsupported education reforms critics say that gatesbacked reforms such as increasing the use of technology in education may financially benefit microsoft and the gates family the foundation trust invests undistributed assets with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment as a result its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the foundation is attempting to relieve poverty these include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world in response to press criticism the foundation announced in  a

innovation for toilets and everything they are connected to example for technology innovation the offgrid nano membrane toilet of cranfield university  prototype on display at reinvent the toilet fair in delhi india the water sanitation and hygiene wash program of the bill  melinda gates foundation was launched in mid as a learning initiative and became a fullfledged program under the global development division in early  the foundation has since  undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research experimentation reflection advocacy and field implementation in  the foundation decided to refocus its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor using nonpiped sanitation services ie without the use of sewers and less on water supply this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments in mid  the foundation announced in its new water sanitation hygiene strategy overview that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation particularly in subsaharan africa and south asia because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions their grantmaking focus has been since  on sanitation science and technology transformative technologies delivery models at

us million to the water sanitation and hygiene sector over the past five years ie since about  for the time period of about  to mid  all grants awarded to water sanitation and hygiene projects totaled

programs including over us billion donated as of  on malaria alone greatly increasing the dollars spent per year on malaria research before the gates efforts on malaria malaria drugmakers had largely given up on producing drugs to fight the disease and the foundation is the worlds largest donor to research on diseases of the poor with the help of gatesfunded vaccination drives deaths from measles in africa have dropped by  percent since  the foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of aids tuberculosis and malaria protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases however a  investigation by the los angeles times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundations allocation of aid first subsaharan africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the gates foundation but by pouring most contributions into the fight against such highprofile killers as aids gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained higherpaid clinicians diverting staff from basic care in subsaharan africa this brain drain adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers second the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation third gatesfunded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent in response the gates foundation has said that african governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars that the foundation has donated at least  million to help improve nutrition and agriculture in africa in addition to its diseaserelated initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in africa both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to bill gatess personal views within the gates foundation insufficient internal debate and pervasive group think critics also complain that gates foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence critics have suggested that gates approach to global health and agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies in which gates invests over the interests of the people of developing countries the global health programs other significant grants

educationedit a key aspect of the gates foundations us efforts involves an overhaul of the countrys education policies at both the k and college levels including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to senioritybased layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers unions it spent  million on education in  it has also donated to the two largest national teachers unions the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative one of the foundations goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the united states and the organization has funded reimagining aid design and delivery grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students with a goal of increasing graduation rates one of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster but that idea has received some pushback from organizations of universities and colleges as part of its educationrelated initiatives the foundation has funded journalists think tanks lobbying organizations and governments millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education including more than  million to the education writers association to fund training for journalists who cover education while some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees who have editorial independence union activists in chicago have accused gates foundation grantee teach plus which was founded by new teachers and advocates against senioritybased layoffs of astroturfing the k and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals parents and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support gates predetermined policy preferences several gatesbacked policies such as small schools charter schools and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance examples of some of the k reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students teachers and schools and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores critics also believe that the gates foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers  some of the foundations educational initiatives have included smaller schools the gates foundation claims one in five students is unable to read and grasp the contents of what they read and african american and latino students are graduating high school with the skills of a middle school student gates foundation has invested more than us million in grants to create new small schools reduce studenttoteacher ratios and to divide up large high schools through the

the bill  melinda gates foundation has overlooked the links between poverty and poor academic achievement and has unfairly demonized teachers for poor achievement by underprivileged students they contend that the gates foundation should be embracing antipoverty and living wage policies rather than pursuing untested and empirically unsupported education reforms critics say that gatesbacked reforms such as increasing the use of technology in education may financially benefit microsoft and the gates family the foundation trust invests undistributed assets with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment as a result its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the foundation is attempting to relieve poverty these include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world in response to press criticism the foundation announced in  a

used by the gates foundation to illustrate their approach to sanitation showing collection transport treatment and reuse play media the gates foundation created this video to advocate for increased innovation for toilets and everything they are connected to example for technology innovation the offgrid nano membrane toilet of cranfield university  prototype on display at reinvent the toilet fair in delhi india the water sanitation and hygiene wash program of the bill  melinda gates foundation was launched in mid as a learning initiative and became a fullfledged program under the global development division in early  the foundation has since  undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research experimentation reflection advocacy and field implementation in  the foundation decided to refocus its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor using nonpiped sanitation services ie without the use of sewers and less on water supply this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments in mid  the foundation announced in its new water sanitation hygiene strategy overview that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation particularly in subsaharan africa and south asia because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions their grantmaking focus has been since  on sanitation science and technology transformative technologies delivery models at scale urban sanitation markets building demand for sanitation measurement and evaluation as well as policy advocacy and communications in mid  the foundation stated that they had committed more than us million to the water sanitation and hygiene sector over the past five years ie since about  for the time period of about  to mid  all grants awarded to water sanitation and hygiene projects totaled

sewerage systems or are not compatible with development country contexts microbial fuel cell stack that converts urine into electricity research by university of the west of england uk since the launch of the reinvent the toilet challenge more than a dozen research teams mainly at universities in the us europe india china and south africa have received grants to develop innovative onsite and offsite waste treatment solutions for the urban poor the grants were in the order of  usd for their first phase followed by typically  million usd for their second phase many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge the reinvent the toilet challenge is focused on reinventing the flush toilet the aim was to create a toilet that not only removes pathogens from human excreta but also recovers resources such as energy clean water and nutrients a concept also known as reuse of excreta it should operate offthegrid without connections to water sewer or electrical networks finally it should costs less than  uscents per user per day hightech toilets for tackling the growing public health problem of human waste are gaining increasing attention but this focus on a technology fix has also been criticized by many in the sector however lowtech solutions may be more practical in poor countries and research is also funded by the foundation for such toilets the reinvent the toilet challenge is a longterm research and development effort to develop a hygienic standalone toilet this challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying called by the foundation the omniingestor and fecal sludge processing called omniprocessor the aim of the omni processor is to convert excreta for example fecal sludge into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients with the potential to develop local business and revenue examples of transformative

developers one example of an omniprocessor is a combustion based system designed to turn fecal sludge into energy and drinking water the development of this particular prototype by usbased company

divisionedit since  the president of the global health program is trevor mundel the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria the foundation has donated more than  billion for global health programs including over us billion donated as of  on malaria alone greatly increasing the dollars spent per year on malaria research before the gates efforts on malaria malaria drugmakers had largely given up on producing drugs to fight the disease and the foundation is the worlds largest donor to research on diseases of the poor with the help of gatesfunded vaccination drives deaths from measles in africa have dropped by  percent since  the foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of aids tuberculosis and malaria protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases however a  investigation by the los angeles times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundations allocation of aid first subsaharan africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the gates foundation but by pouring most contributions into the fight against such highprofile killers as aids gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained higherpaid clinicians diverting staff from basic care in subsaharan africa this brain drain adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers second the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation third gatesfunded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent in response the gates foundation has said that african governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars that the foundation has donated at least  million to help improve nutrition and agriculture in africa in addition to its diseaserelated initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in africa both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to bill gatess personal views within the gates foundation insufficient internal debate and pervasive group think critics also complain that gates foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence critics have suggested that gates approach to global health and agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies in which gates invests over the interests of the people of developing countries the global health programs other significant grants include polio eradication in  the foundation provided us million toward efforts attempting to eradicate poliomyelitis polio the gavi alliance the foundation gave the gavi alliance formerly the global

educationedit a key aspect of the gates foundations us efforts involves an overhaul of the countrys education policies at both the k and college levels including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to senioritybased layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers unions it spent  million on education in  it has also donated to the two largest national teachers unions the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative one of the foundations goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the united states and the organization has funded reimagining aid design and delivery grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students with a goal of increasing graduation rates one of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster but that idea has received some pushback from organizations of universities and colleges as part of its educationrelated initiatives the foundation has funded journalists think tanks lobbying organizations and governments millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education including more than  million to the education writers association to fund training for journalists who cover education while some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees who have editorial independence union activists in chicago have accused gates foundation grantee teach plus which was founded by new teachers and advocates against senioritybased layoffs of astroturfing the k and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals parents and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support gates predetermined policy preferences several gatesbacked policies such as small schools charter schools and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance examples of some of the k reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students teachers and schools and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores critics also believe that the gates foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers  some of the foundations educational initiatives have included smaller schools the gates foundation claims one in five students is unable to read and grasp the contents of what they read and african american and latino students are graduating high school with the skills of a middle

the bill  melinda gates foundation has overlooked the links between poverty and poor academic achievement and has unfairly demonized teachers for poor achievement by underprivileged students they
