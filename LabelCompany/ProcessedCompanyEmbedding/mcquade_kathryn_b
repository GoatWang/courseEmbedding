women is to help their children and the communities they live in   nytimes  the womens crusade by nicholas d kristof and sheryl wudunn published august   in the th century the paramount moral challenge was slavery in the th century it was totalitarianism in this century it is the brutality inflicted on so many women and girls around the globe sex trafficking acid attacks bride burnings and mass rape yet if the injustices that women in poor countries suffer are of paramount importance in an economic and geopolitical sense the opportunity they represent is even greater “women hold up half the sky” in the words of a chinese saying yet that’s mostly an aspiration in a large slice of the world girls are uneducated and women marginalized and it’s not an accident that those same countries are disproportionately mired in poverty and riven by fundamentalism and chaos there’s a growing recognition among everyone from the world bank to the us military’s joint chiefs of staff to aid organizations like care that focusing on women and girls is the most effective way to fight global poverty and extremism that’s why foreign aid is increasingly directed to women the world is awakening to a powerful truth women and girls aren’t the problem they’re the solution   please also see the following link to a us trust publication that addresses highimpact giving to women and girls a guide
