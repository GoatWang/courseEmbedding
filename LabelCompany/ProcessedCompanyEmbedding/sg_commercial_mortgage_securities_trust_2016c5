make them an excellent counterbalance to stocks bonds and cash reits generally own andor manage incomeproducing commercial real estate whether its the properties themselves or the mortgages on those properties you can invest in the companies individually or through an exchangetraded fund or mutual fund there are many types of reits available here we look at a few of the main ones and their historical returns by the end of this article you should have a better idea when and what to buy historical returns of reits real estate investment trusts are historically one of the bestperforming asset classes available the ftse nareit equity reit index is what most investors use to gauge the performance of the us real estate market between  and  the indexs average annual return was  second only to midcap stocks which averaged  per year over the same period in comparison fixed income assets managed  annual returns and commodities just  a year real estate was the worst performer of eight asset classes in just two years out of  fixed income on the other hand was the worst performer six times in the same year period more recently the threeyear average for reits between march  and march  was in line with the averages in the  year period clocking in at  over that time historically investors looking for yield have done better investing in real estate than fixed income the traditional asset class for this purpose a carefully constructed portfolio should consider both learn more in how to assess a real estate investment trust retail reits approximately  of reit investments are in shopping malls and freestanding retail this represents the single biggest investment by type in america whatever shopping center you frequent its likely owned by an reit when considering an investment in retail real estate one first needs to examine the retail industry itself is it financially healthy at present and what is the outlook for the future its important to remember that retail reits make money from the rent they charge tenants if retailers are experiencing cash flow problems due to poor sales its possible they could delay or even default on those monthly payments eventually being forced into bankruptcy at that point a new tenant needs to be found which is never easy therefore its crucial that you invest in reits with the strongest anchor tenants possible these include grocery and home improvement stores once youve made your industry assessment your focus should turn to the reits themselves like any investment its important that they have good profits strong balance sheets and as little debt as possible especially the shortterm kind in a poor economy retail reits with significant cash positions will be presented with opportunities to buy good real estate at distressed prices the bestrun companies will take advantage of this that said there are longer term concerns for the retail reit space in that shopping is increasingly shifting online as opposed to the mall model owners of space have continued to innovate to fill their space with offices and other nonretail oriented tenants but the subsector is under pressure for more insight on commercial real estate check out  steps to a hot commercial real estate deal residential reits these are reits that own and operate multifamily rental apartment buildings as well as manufactured housing when looking to invest in this type of reit one should consider several factors before jumping in for instance the best apartment markets tend to be where home affordability is low relative to the rest of the country in places like new york and los angeles the high cost of single homes forces more people to rent which drives up the price landlords can charge each month as a result the biggest residential reits tend to focus on large urban centers within each specific market investors should look for population and job growth generally when there is a net inflow of people to a city its because jobs are readily available and the economy is growing a falling vacancy rate coupled with rising rents is a sign that demand is improving as long as the apartment supply in a particular market remains low and demand continues to rise residential reits should do well as with all companies those with the strongest balance sheets and the most available capital normally do the best healthcare reits healthcare reits will be an interesting subsector to watch as americans age and healthcare costs continue to climb healthcare reits invest in the real estate of hospitals medical centers nursing facilities and retirement homes the success of this real estate is directly tied to the healthcare system a majority of the operators of these facilities rely on occupancy fees medicare and medicaid reimbursements as well as private pay as long as the funding of healthcare is a question mark so are healthcare reits things you should look for in a healthcare reit include a diversified group of customers as well as investments in a number of different property types focus is good to an extent but so is spreading your risk generally an increase in the demand for healthcare services which should happen with an aging population is good for healthcare real estate therefore in addition to customer and propertytype diversification look for companies whose healthcare experience is significant whose balance sheets are strong and whose access to lowcost capital is high office reits office reits invest in office buildings they receive rental income from tenants who have usually signed longterm leases four questions come to mind for anyone interested in investing in an office reit what is the state of the economy and how high is the unemployment rate what are vacancy rates like how is the area in which the reit invests doing economically how much capital does it have for acquisitions try to find reits that invest in economic strongholds its better to own a bunch of average buildings in washington dc than it is to own prime office space in detroit for example for more on commercial real estate see find fortune in commerical real estate mortgage reits approximately  of reit investments are in mortgages as opposed to the real estate itself the best known but not necessarily the greatest investments are fannie mae and freddie mac governmentsponsored enterprises that buy mortgages on the secondary market but just because this type of reit invests in mortgages instead of equity doesnt mean it comes without risks an increase in interest rates would translate into a decrease in mortgage reit book values driving stock prices lower in addition mortgage reits get a considerable amount of their capital through secured and unsecured debt offerings should interest rates rise future financing will be more expensive reducing the value of a portfolio of loans in a lowinterest rate environment with the prospect of rising rates most mortgage reits trade at a discount to net asset value per share the trick is finding the right one learn more about the effects of interest rates in the impact of interest rates on real estate investment trusts the keys to assessing any reit ive talked about specific types of reits as well as what to look for when investing in them however there are a few things to keep in mind when assessing any reit they include the following reits are true totalreturn investments they provide high dividend yields along with moderate longterm capital appreciation look for companies that have done a good job historically at providing both unlike traditional real estate many reits are traded on stock exchanges you get the diversification real estate provides without being locked in long term liquidity matters depreciation tends to overstate an investments decline in property value thus instead of using the payout ratio what dividend investors use to assess an reit look at its funds from operations ffo instead this is defined as net income less the sale of any property in a given year and depreciation simply take the dividend per share and divide by the ffo per share the higher the yield the better strong management makes a difference look for companies that have been around for a while or at least possess a management team with loads of experience quality counts only invest in reits with great properties and tenants consider buying a mutual fund or etf that invests in reits and leave the research and buying to the pros bottom line the federal government made it possible for investors to buy into largescale commercial real estate projects as far back as  however only in the last decade have individual investors embraced reits reasons for this include low interest rates which forced investors to look beyond bonds for incomeproducing investments the advent of exchangetraded and mutual funds focusing on real estate and until the  real estate meltdown an insatiable appetite on the part of americans to own real estate and other tangible assets reits like every other investment in  suffered greatly but despite this they continue to be an excellent addition to any diversified portfolio for related reading take a look

vehicleentity  spvspea special purpose vehicleentity spvspe is a subsidiary company with an assetliability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent company goes bankrupt an spvspe is also a subsidiary corporation designed to serve as a counterparty for swaps and other credit sensitive derivative instruments although the spvsspes are used to isolate financial risk due to accounting loopholes these vehicles may become a financially devastating way for cfos to hide debt as with the enron bankruptcy breaking down special purpose vehicleentity  spvspespvsspes may be formed through limited partnerships trusts corporations limited liability corporations or other entities an spvspe may be designed for independent ownership management and funding of a company as protection of a project from operational or insolvency issues or for creating a synthetic lease that is expensed on the company’s income statement rather than recorded as a liability on the balance sheet they help companies securitize assets create joint ventures isolate corporate assets or perform other financial transactions offbalancesheet spvspe an offbalancesheet spvspe documents its assets liabilities and equity on its own balance sheet rather than on the parent company’s balance sheet as equity or debt the parent company typically prefers this arrangement due to improved management of assets and liabilities lower risks higher credit ratings lower funding costs greater financial flexibility and lower capital requirements spvsspes mask crucial information from investors who are not aware of a company’s complete financial situation investors need to look at the parent company’s balance sheet as well as the spv’sspe’s balance sheet before deciding whether to invest in a business enron’s massive financial collapse is a prime example of why this is important enron’s spvsspes enron transferred much of its quickly rising stock to an spvspe and received cash or a note in return the spvspe used the stock for hedging assets shown on the company’s balance sheet enron guaranteed the spvsspes value as a means of reducing risk when stock prices began dropping along with the values of the spvsspes the guarantees were forced into play enron was unable to pay the large amounts of money it owed creditors and investors leading to a massive financial collapse although the company disclosed its financial information and conflicts of interest on balance sheets for the company and for the spvsspes few investors understood the gravity of the situation and what ended up being a disastrous ending for enron example of an spvspe in march  luxor capital a  billion hedge fund announced it was placing four illiquid securities totaling  of its investments in an spvspe the securities included exposure in food delivery service delivery hero private equity investments in online food ordering company foodpanda and drilling company ascent resources as well as preferred stock in altisource asset management after losing money for months the fund began returning  of exiting investors’ money the rest will be returned when the illiquid investments are sold   contract and

the assigned structured credit assessment of a scapd to the mall at rockingham park loan which represents approximately  of the pool balance the loan is secured by a regional mall in salem nh moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio the moodys actual dscr of x x excluding credit assessed loan is lower than the  conduitfusion allin transaction average of x and other conduitfusion transactions rated by moodys in  x the moodys stressed dscr of x x excluding credit assessed loan is in line with the  conduitfusion transaction allin average of x and other transactions rated in  x the pooled trust loan balance of  represents a moodys ltv ratio of   excluding credit assessed loanwhich is worse than the  conduitfusion allin transaction average of  and worse than the average for pools securitized during   allin there are four loans in the pool structured with additional debt in the form of subordinate debt or mezzanine debt with the additional debt the moodys total debt ltv ratio rises to   excluding the credit assessed loan moodys also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity when selecting a ratings approach with respect to loan level diversity the pools loan level herfindahl score is  which is better than the  conduitonly transaction average of  and better than the average of transactions rated in   with respect to property level diversity the pools property level herfindahl score is  moodys also grades properties on a scale of  to  best to worst and considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment the factors considered include property age quality of construction location market and tenancy the pools weighted average property quality grade is  which is worse than the average score of  calculated across moodysrated multiborrower transactions during the prior four quarters positive features of the pool include the incorporation of one investment grade loan the proportion of loans in the pool benefiting from crosscollateralization and major market share notable concerns offsetting these strengths include the pools ltv ratio leverage dispersion and amortization profile relatively low asset quality grade and exposure to volatile property classes the principal methodology used in these ratings was approach to rating us and canadian conduit fusion cmbs published in december  please see the ratings methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investmentgrade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated aaa sf classes would be aasf aasf and a sf respectively the modelindicated rating for the currently rated aa sf classes would be asf baasf and ba sf respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from the information presented in the parameter sensitivity analysis these ratings a are based solely on information in the public domain andor information communicated to moodys by the issuer at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified by moodys and b must be construed solely as a statement of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer invitation inducement or recommendation to purchase sell or hold any securities or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with any other matter moodys does not guarantee or make any representation or warranty as to the correctness of any information rating or communication relating to the issuer moodys shall not be liable in contract tort statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer or any other third party for any loss injury or cost caused to the issuer or any other third party in whole or in part including by any negligence but excluding fraud dishonesty andor willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be excluded on the part of or any contingency beyond the control of moodys or any of its employees or agents including any losses arising from or in connection with the procurement compilation analysis interpretation communication dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously anticipated factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls moodys ratings address only the credit risks associated with the transaction other noncredit risks have not been addressed and may have a significant effect on yield to investors the ratings do not represent any assessment of i the likelihood or frequency of prepayment on the mortgage loans ii the allocation of net aggregate prepayment interest shortfalls iii whether or to what extent prepayment premiums might be received or iv in the case of any class of interestonly certificates the likelihood that the holders thereof might not fully recover their investment in the event of a rapid rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomresearchdocumentcontentpageaspxdocidpbs the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of debt this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in
