coal reserves we believe we are among the largest holders of coal reserves in the united states our reserves are sufficient to support over  years of production at our current production level we operate three of our four mining complexes with longwall mining systems this highly productive mining method coupled with the favorable geology of our coal has resulted in our mines being among the safest most productive and lowest cost underground coal mines in the united states our four mining complexes williamson sugar camp hillsboro and macoupin are designed to support up to  longwall mining systems with a combined productive capacity of up to  million tons of high btu coal per year our reserves and mines are strategically located near multiple rail and river transportation access points giving us multiple transportation options our access to competing rail carriers as well as access to truck and barge transport provides us with costcompetitive flexibility we own a  million ton per year bargeloading river terminal on the ohio river we have contractual rights to  million tons per year of existing terminal capacity in the gulf of mexico these facilities have longterm fixed price rail contracts ensuring our cost effective access to the export markets our low operating costs competitive transportation rates and high heat content of our coal enable us to be cost competitive on a delivered cost per btu to a wide variety of domestic and international markets we have been exporting coal through new orleans since  to europe south america india and china founder’s history chris cline launched his career in the coal industry in  at the age of  following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father before him he began working as an underground coal miner in southern west virginia he quickly moved into management where he learned to use unique tools to motivate his workforce to develop and run lowcost coal mining operations working proactively with union and unionfree operations chris cline’s successes attracted the notice of major coal companies who engaged him to provide contract mining services for their own mines in  as his market knowledge deepened and he developed a reputation as a lowcost coal producer chris moved his company from its contract mining roots toward developing and operating its own mines preparation plants loading docks and coal sales arms chris formed his energy development group the cline group in  and through his frontline experience in each of these disciplines his proactive approach to mine development and the strength of his workforce and management team he was able to capitalize on opportunities others missed the cline group was soon recognized across the industry as a reliable coal supplier an excellent lessee and a desired employer committed to the health and safety of its miners — characteristics that continue to drive its success today over the next decade the cline group developed and operated some of the most productive underground coal mines in the country its operations in the appalachian region placed the company among the top  coal producers in the united states with an annual production capacity of approximately  million tons in  the cline group sold its mature mining and processing concerns in appalachia and concentrated on developing new opportunities in the coal sector faced with rising mining costs and depleted coal reserves in the appalachian region the cline group shifted its focus to the plentiful coal reserves in the illinois basin the company began acquiring reserves there in  in anticipation of a renewed interest in high sulfur high btu coal foresight energy llc was formed in  to develop and operate the company’s illinois mining assets since that time foresight energy has progressed from undeveloped reserves with zero production to four producing coal mining complexes in central and southern illinois and a highvolume coal transloading facility on the ohio river in indiana and shorthaul railroad lines to increase flexibility company history when our principal owner chris cline began acquiring illinois basin coal reserves in anticipation of renewed interest in high sulfur high btu coal he was sure the reserves would be mined someday perhaps by his grandchildren that day came earlier than expected in  he began permitting the pond creek mine in williamson county illinois chris brought pete hendrick and his mach mining team to illinois to develop this project construction at the mine commenced in early  and the slope construction began in july of that year slope development reached the coal seam at a depth of approximately  feet in mid and following development of the slope bottom commercial coal production began in november  longwall mining production commenced in march  with the successful development and startup of the longwall at pond creek planning began for similar longwall mining operations on other reserve locations controlled by foresight energy in franklin county illinois about  miles north of pond creek development of the slope and surface facilities at the mc  mine began in october  the slope reached the coal seam in january  and first coal shipments occurred in late august  the longwall system began production in the first quarter of  in january  cline acquired coal mining assets in macoupin county illinois from exxonmobil coal usa following the acquisition from exxon macoupin recovered underground equipment power lines water pipe conveyor belt and structure from the prior mine works macoupin then sealed off the majority of the previously mined areas of the mine to reduce the size of the underground area it needed to maintain and essentially created a new underground mine the surface facilities were also upgraded including the rehabilitation of the preparation plant coal production began in the third quarter of  with a single continuous miner supersection utilizing battery powered coal haulers an additional continuous miner unit was added in january  using a flexible conveyor train system instead of coal haulers construction at the fourth mining complex the deer run mine in montgomery county illinois began in may  its slope reached the coal seam in november  and initial coal shipments began in october  its first longwall mining system started in september  other infrastructure to support these four mining complexes was built during this time including nearly  miles of rail spurs and rail loading facilities in april  the  million tons per year sitran barge loading terminal on the ohio

warrior” food bags to ensure that elementary school children receive adequate nutrition when not in school we also sponsored weekly programs to provide children with fresh fruit to ensure that children are prepared for illinois’ harsh weather we have donated winter clothing to local elementary schools in addition we have sponsored reward programs for local honor students established reader

domestic and global markets foresight energy is a leading producer of thermal coal with over  billion tons of coal reserves we are among the largest holders of coal reserves in the united states and our reserves can support over  years of production at our current production level  we operate four mining companies in the illinois basin three of those four mining complexes use highly efficient longwall mining systems this highly productive mining method coupled with the favorable geology of our coal has resulted in our mines being among the safest most productive and lowest cost underground coal mines in the united states improving the quality of life low cost electricity is a staple of life foresight energy utilizes the industrys most modern mining technologies to safely produce the lowest possible cost electricity for all americans safety is our top priority foresight is fully committed to the health and safety of our miners we believe that safety is of paramount importance not only because we care about the health and welfare of our workforce but also because we believe placing a high priority on safety is good business low operating costs competitive transportation our low operating costs competitive transportation rates and high heat content of our coal enables us to be cost competitive on a delivered cost per btu to a wide variety of domestic and international markets safety  foresight energy producing coal for domestic and global markets foresight is fully committed to the health and safety of our miners safety is of paramount importance not only because it ensures the health and welfare of our workforce but also because placing a high priority on safety is good business our management team shares the belief that a workplace that stresses careful compliance with safe working practices leads to compliance with other important areas such as operational methodologies roof control housekeeping and equipment maintenance our success has been recognized with various safety and mine rescue awards most recently one of our mines earned the “best safety frequency award for division  mines” our emphasis on mine rescue operations has led to the training of over  of our miners in fire training for underground mines and preparation plants this means that  in every  of our miners is trained to deal with fire emergencies we have developed several innovative techniques to protect our mines and prevent injuries for example we developed a roof control practice that attaches industrialgrade steel mesh to the roof of our mine entries utilizing a heavyduty steel angle bracket the mesh prevents loose rock or roof material from dislodging and potentially striking a miner  the angle bracket provides extraordinary support to the protective mesh by anchoring into the roof as well as the coal rib another example involves the operator compartment in our shuttle cars we believe we are the only coal operator in the us that has integrated an enclosed and air conditioned operator cab for all shuttle cars the protected environment helps shield the operator from both striking hazards and dust a third example of our commitment to a safe working environment involves our investment in a portable rescue capsule while not required by any rule regulation or law we recognized that an emergency situation could develop in the future where conventional primary and secondary access to one of our mines becomes blocked in this event the ability to quickly provide alternative access could be critical for that reason we own a portable drill the atlas copco rd drill is capable of drilling a  inch diameter hole to a maximum depth of  feet which can reach the depth of all our mines once the hole from the surface to the coal seam is complete we have a selfcontained truck mounted electric escape hoist that can be used to extract trapped miners the hoist is capable of reaching a depth of  feet and is equipped with a vfd drive to reach speeds of  feet per minute the mobile unit is equipped with both a ″ diameter and a ″ diameter escape pod the rescue capsule would be lowered into the coal mine to allow each trapped miner to be raised to the surface microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history must allow firstparty and thirdparty cookies and you must
