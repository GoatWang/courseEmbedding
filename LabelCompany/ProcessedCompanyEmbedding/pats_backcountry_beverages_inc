price right product arrived two days as promised follow up from customer service was great report is this review helpful cool    rainylin   real  days shipping no difficult payment easy communication after having a bad experience with another online shop and finally cancelled my order i went to this online shop i read some bad reviews so i was a bit sceptical i needed my order to be delivered fast since i was only visiting usa but i was still interested in their free day shipping on orders over “ plus they were also having  off so i ordered it and im really satisfied and no difficulty with the online payment at alli used the life chat function on their website it was useful i double checked their  days shipping and also the availability of the item id like to order and yeah it arrived in  days i think ill buy from them again next time report is this review helpful cool    boudreaux   quick and easy i ordered by phone the representative i spoke to was very pleasant and courteous i ordered two alps mountaineering king kong chairs at a good price the chairs were shipped out on the same day and arrived here in two days i will do business with them again report is this review helpful cool    greggshiu   fantastic personalized customer service i must be either the luckiest shopper or just caught them on the upandup because if you read most of these reviews you wouldnt have expected the level of customer service ive received from them on recent orders orders came in a timely manner securely packed and with a free gift of sustainably harvested trail mix snacks or something like that super cute and very unnecessary but appreciated i had a follow up email from a customer account manager which i guess is the new norm i believe maybe this change in direction probably is a direct response to the kind of reviews i see here on rr the only other time ive purchased from them is about a year ago and ended up having to cancel and return the order due to my boss changing his mind i dont recall it being much hassle nor having to pay the return cost as they provided me an rma number though i did feel bad about refunding the  donation i made to the nature conservacy lol overall very good prices with nice selection of outdoorsy stuff and tech stuff in the way of gopro gear definitely will be shopping here again report is this review helpful cool    gerbilnuts   best customer service ever not sure what all the negative reviews are about i have placed multiple orders without any hiccups ivan is my customer service rep and goes above and beyond to ensure that my online experience with backcountrycom met my expectations it is very rare to experience customer service on this level i have received a followup phone call from ivan the day after my online orders were placed every single time to give me shipping confirmation and verify i had a smooth online transaction i have never been this satisfied with an online retailer before i have zero complaints  report is this review helpful cool    gojump   still waiting bought a coat on aug th still waiting sent emails no response dont waste your time report is this review helpful cool    mrseliquor   terrible terrible unbelievably bad customer service i ordered  pairs of leggings  the picture of both the colors i ordered shows them to be full ankle length nowhere in the description of the item does it say what length they were maybe i should have been wary but it was my first time ordering with them and i didnt expect to be ripped off when they arrived they were cropped  calf length i wanted them for winter  traveling so i had to return them but didnt want to pay the  return fee because they had clearly misrepresented what i was buying the guy ian b i was put through to was snarky with me straight away  said i had to pay the fee  telling me that the description said midrise thats a waist description not a length description that all the pictures in the reviews showed calf length  there were no pictures on my review feed it remains to be seen whether they actually process my return at all report is this review helpful cool    yetic   snarky customer service if you are in for open box items and terrible customer service then backcountrycom is for your terrible and deceitful they charge for returns and even for even exchanges come at a fee avoid at all cost no worth the aggravation report is this review helpful cool    selen   yahooo discount first time ordering from backcountrycom so i got  discount when use code on wativcom you are more discount on this site so you need a more discount you check it on this link httpowlyxfqir report is this review helpful cool    morsecode   i have spent thousands of dollars with backcountrycom and will likely spend thousands more the site and service have always been top quality ive spoken on the phone and via realtime chat with representatives and always had success with them im only speaking from my personal experience but bc is the one place i check first for any outdoor apparel generally because of the price and customer service there are other options for shopping when it comes to outdoor gear but backcountrycom is always topnotch  report is this review helpful cool    fpoilane   order  simple bicycle parts  confirm orderone week later not received anything  follow the order  require call

status of the order after i find out and contact them they refuse to give any reason or inform about actions i could do to solve the issue report is this review helpful cool    synoptic   dear sirsi am writing in reference to a recent order purchased through amazon assold by backcountry as the third party merchant when speaking to mark hewas somewhat adamant or indifferent as to my statement regarding falseadvertisement and misrepresentation mark thought it was funny as hecontinued to argue with me then disconnected the call purposely marksversion said that i was hollering at him which was not true the phone callcan be corroborated verbatim i called back and spoke with leroy who triedto snow me in saying that the prepaid return label was a gift frombackcountry when in fact backcountry had no other option than to supply aprepaid label free of charge according to the stipulations on the amazonwebsite leroy did provide a variety of apologies all containingmeaningless words leroy did not provide any adjustment rather offering me day airthe call was logged and can be corroborated verbatim this type of management by a retailer shall only bring poor sales in the near futurethe gloves were defective one as specified above picture enclosed andone picture of the good glove irrespective of the wrong color palmswhich were gray and not black as ordered and pictured weve ordered frombackcountry in past years family and friends however we will no longerbe looking to backcountry to purchase anything and shall send the word toeveryone i wish a full refund and have no intentions none of everpurchasing from backcountry ever again may yahweh bless backcountry andthe staff and personnel i have contacted amazoncom several times regarding annoying harassing emails after the purchase was cancelled backcountrycom continues to send harassing emails through amazon we believe the attorney general can assist in this area all information has been fully documented and can be verified verbatim do not purchase from backcountry for they are nothing more than snakes in the grass report is this review helpful cool    tasha   just would like all to know that the free returns policy on the sunglasses is a scam your charged  shipping when all along you are led to believe in free returns the sun glasses were so large they were falling off my face if that isnt a legitimate reason for returns what is have a large family of  and any further sales will be purchased elsewhere if you say free returns that should mean free report is this review helpful cool    rbccrathe   not only did they ship it to an address that i didnt type nor was on my account when i checked it they said they would do nothing about getting it to me it was shipped to ohio and i live in tn on steap and cheep they sent me a pair of sunglasses that were suppose to have  sets of lenses they came with one and said it was a mistake ya think the headache isnt worth the lack of organizational skills and poor customer service  report is this review helpful cool    timliddell   received my backpack prompt delivery no damage good price exactly as advertised and what i wanted beat amazon by    report

asked questions frequently asked questions is this real yes… how does it taste incredible our sodas are all natural gourmet out of this world awesome and our patent pending modified brewing process is capable of producing the same great tasting beer as a standard brewing process… without the water how concentrated is it very however not all beers have the same percent alcohol concentration therefore a higher alcohol content beer will appear less concentrated because there remains a larger volume of alcohol present after most of the water has been removed conversely lower alcohol beer will appear much more concentrated because in its natural state it contains a higher percentage of water our process does not result in a beer that is  void of water it does however result in a beer with nearly no water content some of our most concentrated beers will be at a nearly a  concentrate level our sodas on the other hand are concentrated to approximately a  ratio concentrate finished

» pro camping tips top ten s in southern california top  outdoor craft beers pro camping tips june   by tristan burnham  no comments we could make a list of  average tips for camping about what to eat what to bring what to wear how to pack ect but you’re rad you already know these things and you don’t need any soccer mom tips about how to roast starbursts over a fire so we decided to make a small list with just the best so here they are the top  pro camping tips  hand sanitizer to start a fire i usually carry some hand sanitizer with me on trips it’s pretty small lightweight and is really useful it’s nice to wash your hands with after an amazing nature poop and i use it to clean my feet at night too there’s a lot of camping hack sites saying doritos can start a fire but i’ve never tried that because i’ve never brought doritos with me on a backpacking trip using a little bit of hand sanitizer is a much easier way to start a fire but try as you might no mater how much a mountain man you are there’s been at least one time you had a hard time getting it raging hand sanitizer is about  alcohol so it burns really well but don’t try and drink it that’s what pat’s backcountry beers are for  frozen water bottles freeze water bottles for your cooler to keep your food and beer cold ditch the old blue ice packs and bags of ice that are just going to melt and get thrown away instead freeze some water bottles and then you’ll have cold water too even for daytrips i’ll freeze bottles for a day of hiking or mountain biking i think there’s a science behind drinking cold water it doesn’t hydrate you as much as water at room temperature but i’ll drink way more water if it’s colder and it feels so much more refreshing wow now i just sound like bobby boucher from the waterboy anyways if you’re on a longer trip and need to keep stuff colder than just a few days refill your bottles with ice from a soda fountain most places will give you free ice in the picture above we poured the ice from the bag into some water bottles  plan your trip google satellite view is an awesome way to plan your trip i screen shot a bunch of landmarks and potential campsites with my phone even when you don’t have service the location sometimes works on your phone for rock climbing long multipitch routes i’ll take pictures of the guide book so i can leave that in the car and go a little bit lighter it’s way easier to take a peek at your phone than to whip out a guide book  feet up remember to take a picture of the approach and descent as well as the route description for most backpacking trips you should still bring a normal paper map but your phone is an awesome tool you should take advantage of in the backcountry  hot water bottle trick for really cold nights boil some water and pour it in a nalgene bottle and then put the bottle in a sock and then throw it in your sleeping bag it can preheat your bag so when you climb in its all nice and toasty it will also keep you warmer for most of the night make two one for your feet and one to snuggle with dogs love this trick too  poach a campsite if you’re car camping you don’t need to stay at an actual campsite and pay  per night most places have dispersed camping which means you can camp for free almost anywhere in the forest like a backpacking trip you can stop wherever you want and stay the night but you can do the same thing car camping you won’t get the same amenities but who needs a stinking bathroom anyways blm land is usually free to camp at too even national parks have wilderness permits where you can hike  minutes from the road and set up tent for the night for free just make sure you check the rules at the area you plan to stay at now get out and enjoy the great outdoors and put these tips to use you’ll be more comfortable and have more money for a longer adventure or better beer click here to learn more about our brew concentrate and carbonator bottles backpacking blog camping tips

lost coast trail march   by tristan burnham  no comments if you’re looking to plan a backpacking trip in march or april there are quite a few options one of our favorite springtime destinations is northern california’s lost coast a mile stretch of rugged undeveloped and mountainous coastline the lost coast trail is a beautiful and unique backpacking experience that combines stunning coastline oldgrowth redwoods and black sand beaches driftwood on an empty sandy beach not the scenery we usually associate with backpacking in california the lost coast is made up of two places its northern reaches are part of the kings range conservation area and the southern portion is the sinkyone wilderness state park if you want to bring your dog we always do you’ll be hiking the  miles of trail that make up the kings range conservation area if you’re not bringing a pup either section of the lost coast trail is an option while the main trails especially in the kings range take you along the beach there are many opportunities to head inland which means you’ll be gaining some elevation if you time the tides wrong these inland detours will be your only option on the northern portions of trail there are trails that will take you inland and most of them involve some solid elevation gain bring a map and be prepared to find yourself in a maze of cattle trails if you’re hiking the king’s range the views are worth the extra effort the kings range portion has two access points shelter cove and mattole beach you’ve got the options of a mile pointtopoint you’ll need a shuttle or an outandback bring a tide chart and be prepared to plan your hike accordingly there are spots that you can’t get through and certainly don’t want to be during high tide there are also a handful of creek crossings which can get pretty rowdy during heavy rains one of the many creeks you’ll be crossing on the lost coast trail even during a relatively dry period it only rained on us for a few hours the entire week we were there all of the creeks were flowing although they were never more than knee deep they can get tricky and dangerous during heavy rains if you’re hiking the sinkyone wilderness state park your access points are the usal beach campground at the southern reaches of the state park or shelter cove your options include a pointtopoint again you’ll need to arrange a shuttle or an outandback the ultimate challenge – something we are yet to do – is an outandback of the entire lost coast trail most of what is now the sinkyone wilderness state park and kings range conservation area was privately owned land that was acquired by the blm and the state of california there are still remnants of private resisdences as well as cattle ranches blm land is also leased for grazing purposes so don’t be surprised if you see cattle on the inland portions of trail remnants of the lost coast before it was acquired by the blm the cattle we came across were generally unfazed by our presence and didn’t make an effort to avoid us we did find ourselves in a maze of cattle trail but fortunately navigating is easy when you can see the coastline head in the general direction of where you’re going be mindful of cliffs and you’ll eventually find your way back on familiar sand there are still private ranches that escaped the blm’s land acquisition while cattle are generally docile it’s always wise to exercise caution when they’re with young calves there are plenty of beautiful spots to stop and camp along the trail some of them are nearly on the beach while others are slightly further inland our favorite spot was on the banks of a creek crossing with an excellent fire ring and a tremendous view of the ocean you wouldn’t know from this photo but our campsite on night two was just a few feet from a creek and a fewhundred yards from the pacific ocean still one of the greatest campsites we’ve ever found there is some surf along the lost coast the hike in is worth the effort but if it’s firing there’s a chance surprisingly that you won’t be alone on our most recent visit the surf was headhigh and there was a lone soul having a great session on a perfect left lost coast surf spot – if you’re willing to find it it’s worth the effort it goes without saying that a remote break in the northern pacific demands respect so be smart pack rain gear and a tide chart and if you’re planning on going mayjune be ready for a lot of ticks to end up on you and your dog this is why we enjoy the lost coast in march – we’ll take rain over ticks any day and don’t forget to visit the lost coast brewery in eureka they’ve got good food and solid beer not that we usually need to convince people to visit a brewery anyways… photos mirenda yates mirendayates text jesse scarantino

trailspace review corps samples provided by pats backcountry beverages for testing and review summary this is a product for those for whom a little extra expense and a little extra weight is money well spent and weight well carried if it can produce the comfort of a soda or beer in the backcountry not for beer snobs or ultralighters but cheers to the rest pros soda and beer in the backcountry without the weight wellmade system easy to use cons activator flavor detectable in some beverages systemspecific bottle required convenience comes at a price more expensive than storebought beverages this winter holiday season i tested pat’s backcountry beverages carbonator bottle a pack box of activator packets and a generous supply of pat’s allnatural cola pat’s allnatural root beer and the pale rail  abv and black hops  abv beers while i used my own experience to test the beers i enlisted the palates of my children to test the sodas—kids are always honest about foods and drinks they like or dislike and their takes on pats sodas were no exception i am fortunate to live in the central piedmont area of north carolina a region with more than  miles of greenways and watershed trails and one that sits in close proximity to the  plus acres of the uhwharrie national forest it was to these haunts i turned for testing for they offered me the opportunity to go on kidfriendly treks with my boys and to be a super dad capable of producing sodas midhike as well as allowing me to experience solo wilderness travel for purposes of familiarity for comparison i also tested pats sodas and beers at home in the environment where i experience their storebought counterparts in mugs or glasses i also toted a plastic glass into the wilderness too just to be fair the pat’s backcountry system three purchased components are required to make backcountry beverage magic with this system the pat’s backcountry beverages carbonator bottle a beverage concentrate and an activator packet you will need your own preferred choice of potable water too the carbonator bottle is a  oz  ml bpafree bottle that weighs in at  oz  g a clear plastic exterior is marked with the pertinent measurements for using the bottle as a carbonating device— oz—and more     and  oz too measurements that could be handy for backcountry cooking though metric measurements are not provided naturally the bottle can be used as a water bottle if one wishes too by simply unscrewing the lid which has a loop of plastic that would allow one to fasten it to a pack with a carabiner one unique and essential aspect of this bottle is this lid though which contains a pump that draws a sufficient amount of water into the lid to later cause a reaction with the activator packet’s contents it also has attached to the lid a blue carbonation chamber into this clear bottle go water and beverage concentrate a base mixture at right below that will eventually produce a carbonated beverage the average beverage concentrate weighs  oz g mixing concentrate and water is as simple as filling the bottle with water and one concentrate packet to the  oz line and shaking the closed bottle a blue plastic interior container attaches to the lid and it is this carbonation chamber wherein the activator packets above at left are emptied when one wishes to carbonate a beverage each activator packet contains separate compartments of potassium bicarbonate  g and citric acid  g which—when mixed together—react with water to provide carbonation for the bottle’s contents whether that is a soda or beer concentrate activator packets weigh  oz  g the procedure the procedure is simple after a few times through it first potable water is drawn by way of the lid’s pump lever into the lid then the activator mix is added to the dry carbonation chamber which is reattached to the lid and set aside next one empties a packet of concentrate into the bottle and fills the remaining space with potable water reattaching the lid to the bottle see image below the pump lever in the lid is then used to squirt water into the carbonation chamber as things start to fizz one shakes the whole contraption side to side for a minute or two then opens the pump lever one more time to release excess carbonation before unscrewing the lid an enjoying pour in your favorite glass or just drink from the bottle itself as one would from a nalgene voilà below is the black hops carbonated and ready to have the pressure released       with the lifting of a lever a handy plastic glass adds a touch of onthetrail luxuryin practice this procedure becomes like any camp routine such as pitching a tarp or building a fire—virtually automatic but if my explanation is unclear take a look at this video wherein i demonstrate the bottle at the core of the system reviewing the sodas my team of experts—my boys—and i found the sodas to be palatable “not as fizzy dad as my regular root beer” said my sixth grade expert and this critique is one that holds true for all the pat’s backcountry beverages i made using this system the carbonation the system produces is finer than carbon dioxideinjected storebought beverages or most naturally fermented beverages i would call it subtle but apparent like a beverage in a twoliter bottle that has been open for a day or two soda flavors are rich and recognizable given their labels—allnatural root beer tasted like what i think of as being root beer allnatural cola tasted like cola maybe more like pepsi than coke we’ll call them more or less true to taste but with less effervescent carbonation the low carbonation did cause hesitance from my kids while they loved the wow factor of being able to make these drinks in the wilderness they said they were “different” due to the lower carbonation fair enough but testing the root beer again on an unseasonably warm day in the uhwharrie mountains ˚ f i found the root beer to be perfect carbonated enough to tickle the tongue rich in flavor and satisfying after a brisk hike to camp context influences perception reviewing the beers like the sodas the beers had a smoother subtler carbonation than most storebought brews the beers both had a distinctive flavor not unpleasant that i attributed to the activator ingredients something that the soda concentrates seemed to mask more effectively with their thicker more syrupy concentrates initially this flavor got my attention but after a few sips the effect was less obvious pinning down the exact flavor of this activator is elusive—it is a vaguely citrusysodawatery the black hops  abv pint is described by pat’s as “hand crafted using the worlds most environmentally friendly brewing process generous additions of cascade hops combined with a bold blend of dark roasted malts creates a smooth yet robust craft brew” this was the richer heavier and maltier of the two brews that also translated into less susceptible to having the activator flavors intrude for me that was a bonus but i also like  dark beer and this has a dark chocolate hue i enjoyed relaxing in my hammock with a black hops on a clear ˚ f day the pail rail  abv pint is the lighter brew reddish in color and described by pat’s as being “hand crafted using the world’s most environmentally friendly brewing process a delicate blend of aromatic malts and cascade hops delivers a complex yet wellbalanced craft brew” this was to my palate the milder of the two brews review corps member kiwiklimber noted that it sounded like the pail rail was a summer brew and i think that is a fair description id love to try one of these midjuly after a brutal uphill climb because pail rail is the milder one it was also a bit more subject to the flavor infusion i attributed to the activator ingredients i found myself wanting to have the second and third sip to lessen this curious flavor but never did this keep me from finishing a brew i liked pail rail but i would have liked to have the activator ingredients assume a less prominent role in the flavor synthesis i can only imagine what a dice roll it is to brew beer knowing that the final product will be carbonated with an infusion—partscience partart i imagine pat’s will keep toying with recipes conclusions the product quality of this system is good the bottle feels as solid as any nalgene although after some use the threads on the lid got a little quirky—be careful not to over tighten the carbonation chamber activator packets and beverage concentrates come in easytear airtight packaging with adequate directions included nothing feels cheap about this system  let’s talk weight and let’s get the obvious out of the way no ultralight purist would sanction carrying the extra weight required to make your own carbonated sodas or beer in the backcountry but for those who may want a little refreshment beyond potable water the weight is this for  oz  grams you can tote the bottle an activator packet and a beverage concentrate along on your quest this weight does not include water weight—you’ll be toting or finding that anyway—but in comparison a single bottled beer i am out of canned beverages as i write weighs about  oz  g given a ready supply of water a second beverage of choice—just the activator and concentrate packets—would cost you only an additional  oz  g gram weenies earn the admiration and envy of this lightweight camper on many a climb but if i were to hoist a pint of pats backcountry beer in camp the tables might be turned flavorwise this system offers some intriguing backcountry options i will confess that i am probably too much on the lightweight side of the scales to bring this system with me to carbonate soda sans kids anyway it isn’t that these aren’t passable backcountry options if one wanted a soda at the end of a long day and if one recognized that these are somewhat different than storebought precarbonated sodas i say go for it it is the kidfriendly option too but the more spirited aspects of pat’s beers would and did induce me to tote them along on my own treks after testing them once or twice pail rail and black hops are unmistakably beer backcountry beer yes but the differences i noted between backcountry carbonation and other brews are ameliorated by one key ingredient in these beverages especially if one pint becomes two or if as i did you only use about  oz of water if you like beer for all of the usual reasons you will understand my own satisfaction at pulling out this system making a brew and settling into my hammock to watch mother nature do her thing a pint made from cold water after a long hike—that is the stuff that dreams are made of additional reflections kiwiklimber asked me about temperature i tested these beverages in weather ranging from the low s to the mids degrees fahrenheit i saw no discernible difference in the effectiveness of the carbonation process based on any particular temperature range another trailspace review corps member bill heiser inquired about altitude relaying an anecdote about one of his own jmt experiences wherein he ingested quite a lot of carbonated beverages and subsequently rued his decision i have little altitude around me sitting as i write this at  feet above sea level if anyone has tried these at noticeable altitude please add a comment below gse moderator very nice review bentbrook my problem with a product like this is increasingly we mankind bring the conveniences of home to the outdoors rather than taking nature as it is i dont want to hike a trail with headphones on or worse the guy who brought external speakers for his ipod i dont want to check facebook or make phone calls and id rather hike into a bar to get a burger  a beer that ive been craving for a week than finish every day with a drink in hand i know some will disagree with me and i respect that but i enter the outdoors to get away from my daily lifethe soda the processed food the constant noise again though this was a very good review  years ago bentbrook thanks gse i share your perspective in many regards my own evolution as a backpacker has led me to shed gear to be more purposeful in choosing that gear which i carry thank you trailspace for an excuse to reflect and to develop my knowledge natural awareness navigation tracking etc like you i never listen to music in the wilderness nature trumps anything i could bring to those environs and while i carry a phone to calm my wifes concerns when im solo and to snap the occasional pic i am much happier returning to natures rhythm with my surroundings than fretting with technology geeky navigational toys asidei love to see elevation profiles and waypoints once im back home lets get back to muir and thoreau but i think each person should hyoh and thus i think this is a niche product for special circumstances clearly it demands responsible use both in terms of lnt and in terms of personal safety if one is opting for beer over soda i would not carry this very often i am not one to carry alcohol with me into the backcountry save what i use in my caldera cone stove for a variety of reasonssafety weight and the need to distance myself from that world the daily life as you put it but i am also a fan of innovation and pats has definitely come up with something interesting here i can think of the end of one truly grueling day on the trail last year when having this option would have been welcome after the days ardor was past it was the last night on the trail followed by a short hike out the next morning and every muscle and bone in my body raged against me for pushing them as i had done the whole day and indeed for the previous week yet for all ive had that sort of moment ive had many more when freshly filtered stream water tasted like ambrosia when i drank with regret the last drop of mountain spring water in my car on my way back to the routine of everyday existence i think you raise an excellent point what we take with us is in some ways indicative of what we seek to take from a wilderness experience to escape from ones escape is certainly ironic  years ago fromsagetosnow this sounds fun when carrying beer becomes a weight issue you can have a celebratory brew made from mountain water i hope this company does well  years ago fromsagetosnow id love to try this at  feet or so this summer to see what altitude does to it i drank a rainier beer at the summit of the same mountain k and it was a little messy but otherwise fine  years ago ashleigh moderator thanks for the awesome review bentbrook ive been very curious to hear an honest review of this product for quite some time now i think it is a really awesome and fun concept my only concern about this is that i am really picky about having my beer cold it seems that i could only use it during the late fallwinterearly spring  years ago bentbrook jeff i remain curious about the altitude aspect too i hope someone adds a comment based on personal experience and thank you ashleigh i understand the cold beer need for the record i think the black hops lends itself more to lessthanicy drinking than the pail rail for those for whom iciness is less of an issue in my opinion though either would be more palatable than a lessthancold mainstream domestic beer  years ago alicia trailspace staff thanks for doing the arduous testing on these bentbrook ive been very curious to see how they actually worked out and was eager to read your review i admit i probably wouldnt carry them myself except for a special occasion but i bet you could make a lot of friends if you did  years ago sean van cleve guideoutfitter mmmmmmmm beer although i am in agreement with most everybody here about not carrying this it might be a very different story staying at a basecamp for an extended time thanks for the hard work and excellent review on something that a lot of us here have been waiting for i have heard of people who stash a couple of cold ones in a stream for the return to the trailhead  years ago bentbrook yes sean there is definitely a time and place for everything including beer and if part of a trek is spending time with a close friend hoisting a pint makes a lot of sense certainly more so than if i am seeking solitude in nature nice to have a viable lightweight option  years ago lah it seems to me to be a very interesting and innovative niche product i can see guide companies using this to improve clients experiences at base camps and beyond as independent outdoorspersons we forget that others go into the outdoors for reasons other than to simply enjoy nature its a sad fact but as such i can definitely see there being a market for this product lookout box wine you now have a competitor  years ago fromsagetosnow if there were a drinking game where you drank every time someone said i wish there was dehydrated beer to drink hiking i think id be dead  years ago seth levy trailspace staff amazing review bentbrook you are making me thirsty  years ago bentbrook thank you seth  years ago vote up  vote down pats backcountry beverage carbonator i love sipping… may   ctl  reviewer rep rating source bought it new price paid  for starter kit summary pats backcountry beverage carbonator i love sipping back a cold soda after a hard days hike climb etc but hate carrying the weight with pats backcountry carbonator now you can have an ice cold soda without having to pack all

its been a long hot hike and now its time to settle down camp is set up sun is setting and the moon is rising suddenly you wish you had a cold soda or an ice cold beer then you remember youve been drinking water from your carbonator you head down to the ice cold stream that is fed from the melting snow and begin to purify some water right into the carbonator in a few minutes youre sipping a bear foot root beer watching the sun set over the peaks thinking what a life pats backcountry beverage portable carbonator rocks love having soda soon beer in the backcountry but hate the hassle of carrying a  pack of bottles convenient eco friendly and tasty the carbonator is a little smaller than a nalgene bottle using the soda concentrate which comes in a pack about the size of gu the ecoactivator pack and clean purified water you can now conveniently make a  oz size soda in the backcountry the process takes about  minutes once you get the steps down if my yearold can figure it you know the carbonator kit which is a starter kit for  comes with everything to get you started the carbonator bottle  tasty and creative soda concentrates the flavors are terra cola poma granite cola lemon clime bear foot root beer my favorite and ginger trail plus  packets of eco activator powder and easy to follow instructions they also have instructions on how to make your own soda concentrate the soda concentrate is made with cane juice contains vitamins and has natural flavors there is nothing artificial there is a learning curve with this but as i stated above if my yearold can figure it you should be able to as well practice before you go out the company keeps pushing back the date on the beer concentrate disappointing but i think its due to the difference in laws from state to state pats backcountry is a small business based in alaska according to its website enjoy peter just a question but wouldnt the beer have to be nonalcoholic  years ago alicia trailspace staff peter this is from the pats faq about alcohol content how concentrated is it very however not all beers have the same percent alcohol concentration therefore a higher alcohol content beer will appear less concentrated because there remains a larger volume of alcohol present after most of the water has been removed conversely lower alcohol beer will appear much more concentrated because in its natural state it contains a higher percentage of water our process does not result in a beer that is  void of water it does however result in a beer with nearly no water content some of our most concentrated beers will be at a nearly a  concentrate level our sodas on the other hand are concentrated to approximately a  ratio concentrate finished beverage  years ago seth levy trailspace staff i should say that there are some dehydrated alcohols in development so theoretically it would be possible to reduce beer to something close to a solid actually a lot of the big brewers do something similar with high gravity brewing and vacuum distillation whether this produces a beer thats worth drinking is an entirely different story  years ago ctl yes i love my carbonator and am curiously awaiting the beer of course i want to test first their sodas are good hoping the beer would be too ill just have to make sure my son doesnt accidentally use a beer concentrate thinking its soda  years ago peter so the concentrates arent powdered but liquid and in a beer the remaining fluid would be alcohol not water okay that makes sense  years ago ctl yes peter the concentrates are liquid and come in small packages that look like a package of gu at least the soda concentrates are havent seen the beer yet  years ago your review have you used this please share your experience where to buy sponsored links

and you may find yourself thinking that the only possible way to make it better would be with a tall cold one that’s a dream for many hardcore hikers and the tale spun by patrick tatera founder of pat’s backcountry beverages in alaska tatera thought long and hard about how to make it work recommends  pat’s backcountry beverages  learn how we rate wired impressive technology and clever engineering if youre a hiker and a beer fanatic this could make your day at  for the carbonator  for a pack of activator packets and  for a fourpack of brew concentrate its not prohibitively priced tired beer concentrates and the carbonator make brews that can be good but they arent great then again you might not care after a long day of hiking buy it now     pats backcountry how we rate a complete failure in every way sad really serious flaws proceed with caution downsides outweigh upsides recommended with reservations solid with some issues very good but not quite great excellent with room to kvetch nearly flawless metaphysical perfection that meant he’d need a way to carbonate mountain stream water and combine that with a syrupy sort of “brew concentrate” there are so many variables at play that can make a huge difference with carbonation in general—the temperature of the liquid and the amount of sugar in it for example—that it’s amazing his creation works at all even if the results are mixed the setup now dubbed the portable beverage carbonator looks like a futuristic nalgene bottle the bottle is  the carbonation packs are  for  and fourpack of beer concentrate is  you start by filling the bottle with water and the syrup from a flavor packet then you pump water from a secret compartment hidden inside the lid into another compartment—the “reactor cup” which is filled with packets citric acid and potassium bicarbonate—and the fizzing begins immediately you shake the whole bottle for a couple of minutes transferring the pressure to the drink and suddenly you’ve got a carbonated beverage there are nonalcoholic options try making pat’s allnatural cola add some ice cubes when its done and it tastes impressively like coke or pepsi the lemonlime flavor tastes like something halfway between sprite and the original powdered gatorade it’s nice enough pat’s “brew concentrates” are something different altogether in an overly simplified nutshell regular beer is typically brewed by adding grain to hot water adding yeast to the resulting liquid the wort allowing it to ferment then carbonating if necessary considering that it was squeezed from a tube the pale rail is impressive sort of like a decent homebrew during that process sugar in the wort feeds the yeast and the yeast creates alcohol too high a percentage of alcohol causes the yeast to slow down and eventually stop to create the beer syrup pat’s uses a proprietary technique it calls “nested fermentation” where the brewers continually add sugars and remove alcohol it makes for some very happy yeast using pat’s method the brewers add the alcohol back to the mixture at the end of the process it yields a syrup with close to  percent alcohol by volume which pat’s refers to as a  concentrate combine the syrup water and carbonate and a glass of the resulting concoction has a similar flavor and percentage of alcohol to “normal” beer it’s enough of a change in the brewing that the packets can’t legally be called beer so pat’s gets clever and calls it “brew” regardless there’s a ton of potential and it has a much longer shelf life than bottled beer brewers could use this idea to create fountainstyle beer similar to the way fountain soda is made from syrup which saves coke and pepsi millions in shipping costs the work pat’s is doing now with  ratios allows them to “clone” a beer the curious can watch for an announcement about this at the  national restaurant association show in chicago at the end of may the taste test the proof however is in the packets after testing the sodas it was sufficiently close enough to  pm to call my brotherinlaw ben and start shaking up some beer i had samples of pat’s pale rail a type of pale ale and pat’s dark hoppy black hops i picked up a growler of real pale ale at seattle’s flying lion brewery and keeping it in the pacific northwest a porter from tacoma’s wingman brewers—not perfect matches but close enough to provide nice comparisons considering that it was squeezed from a tube the pale rail is impressive sort of like a decent homebrew the flying lion was of course fantastic full of lovely peach and apricot notes a balanced bitterness and a purposeful wellcalibrated carbonation “the flying lion tastes more complete” ben remarked though he and i reasoned that at  feet you’d gladly overlook any sort of defect in the pale rail pat’s founder tatera admits to the limitations of the beer made in the carbonator saying that the  ratio helps keep it as light as possible for long hikes if the furthest you’re heading is your fridge and you still want to try beer from a squeeze tube tatera suggests using a home carbonator like a sodastream or the drinkmate i handed the carbonator and a packet of black hops over to ben and he looked around for a way to set the roundbottomed reactor cup down on the counter i offered to help “i’ll get it” he said “you can’t ask a bear to hold your reactior cup out in the woods” fair enough though ben was i bigger fan than i was the black hops wasn’t our favorite particularly stacked up against the porter from tacoma but again after a long day of hiking it would still be nice i may have also considered just bringing a flask of scotch is pat’s carbonator and beer for you it’s not really for home drinking but if you’ve got a long hike ahead and need a light pack the answer might lie at the end of a long trail food writer joe ray joediner is a lowell thomas travel journalist of the year a restaurant critic and author of “sea and smoke” with chef blaine wetzel when you

march   product review pats backcountry beverages dry trail dust layered on your tongue sore feet aching legs a tired body whether you have reached the summit of a mountain or completed a grueling hike in steep terrain you did it how do you cap it all off an ice cold carbonated beverage would be perfect even  miles deep in the backcountry pat’s backcountry beverages makes that a reality yes you can make your own soda or brew your own beer in the backcountry and it is surprisingly easy to do two months ago after reading about this unique system i spoke with pat’s backcountry beverages regarding the product and was intrigued founded by pat tatera nearly two decades ago the company was built to produce an ecofriendly way to make beverages with a much smaller carbon footprintfrom their website introducing the most environmentallyresponsible carbonated beverage system on earth this awesome little addition to your gear list is engineered with an emphasis on rugged durability and first of its kind functionality in its more docile state it functions as your standard everyday water bottle yawn however when you decide to kick it into high gear and unleash the technology hiding under its cap you get a burst of refreshing carbonation to energize any beverage of your choice so no matter how far your wanderlust leads you down the trail you can still enjoy a crisp carbonated beverage anywhere on the planet cheers the carbonator bottle is lightweight and well constructed it can be used to make your soda or beer but also as an ordinary water bottle but who wants to do that it even has a carabiner clip attachment to be sure you don’t lose it on the trail that would be a travesty the activator packets are small and so are the concentrated beverage both will fit in your hand i took two activator packets and two concentrated beverage packs and stuck them inside the bottle on the hike it’s an excellent way to reduce space and protect the kit i ordered two types of concentrated beer the  pale rail and the black hops because i had to do a thorough review for you guys  let’s get down to brass tacks how does it work the paper instructions that comes with the orange carbonator bottle are to the point but can seem overwhelming as the paper is folded up like a giant map there is an easy to follow demonstration on the pbcb website by pat himself i’ll be honest i watched the video that pat put together showing how to use it and i then watched it again to be sure i knew exactly how to do it the second time was much easier to follow as i was sure to hold the bottle in my hands and repeat what pat did after hiking  miles of steep terrain and enduring a barrage of rain brett and i were ready for a cold beverage i chose to bring a  pale rail and a black hops for us to share pbcb highly recommends you use chilled or cold water to brew i will be honest and say that while i had water frozen in my container we hiked twelve miles and not only did the ice thaw the water warmed up to slightly warmer than chilled i only realized this after brewing the first beer the pale rail i won’t go through the directions in detail you can get that from the video but i repeated them and in less than two minutes we had a cold beer ready to drink we split the  oz and enjoyed it thoroughly i made the black hops a few minutes later and when that was ready we split that too everyone has been asking me how does it taste the  pale rail tastes great even with less than ideal chilled water the flavor and aroma was excellent we both agreed that if i had ice cold water it would have been even better we both thought the black hops was ok but not what we expected and it wasn’t as strong in flavor as the pr both were good but the pale rail took top honorsoverall this is one of the coolest products i have reviewed and it is certainly one of the most unique there are different ways to combine the different products available for purchase i purchased the orange carbonator bottle for  the pack activator for  and the beer concentrate was  for each pk i think that overall the system is offered at a very reasonable price just imagine how incredible it would be to hike into the backcountry and use cold spring water to make your own beer i eagerly await what new products the pats backcountry beverages team creates and i happily offer up my taste buds as test

acclaimed carbonator… june   updated jan   njhiker  reviewer rep rating source bought it new price paid  for the kit  bottle  activators and  packs of each flavor summary perfect companions to their highly acclaimed carbonator bottle these flavors give the user the ability to brew fresh adult beverages pros nice to have a choice of adult beverages once camp is set a lot lighter than carrying a pint of ale rather tasty once you get used to the process shipping varies by state but always requires a signature by an adult over  years of age cons the instructions are a little daunting at first only  flavors currently availableupdated shipping requires a signature by an adult over  years of age arrange delivery to a place you will be im not a huge proponent of imbibing on the trail but on a hot summer night after a day long hike theres nothing quite as satisfying as a cool frothy ale by the fire pit to set the night off right  ill review the two adult beverages here with hopes that someone more experienced with the soda flavors might chime in the mixing and carbonation process takes a little practice but once youve mastered it its not too bad and is the same for these as the available soda flavors  pale rail ale is a blend of mild and aromatic malts and cascade hops that delivers a complex wellbalanced craft styled brew its initial taste is that of a sweeter malty ale with a sharp not overpowering snap of hops i noted slight flowery nuances of vanilla cardamom and coriander in the aftertaste its really quite delicious and refreshing when made with filtered cold spring water and compares to commercial or boutique brands quite favorably different slightly smokey flavor elements are present when this mix is made with warmer water black hops ipa is crafted using generous portions of cascade hops combined with a bold blend of dark roasted malts to create a smooth yet robust dark brew this is not a typical stout or porter but more of a tribute to those styles with a heavy dose of hops in the tradition of india pale ales this ipa is big — in a surprising combination of flavors dark smokey roasted and sweet elements are offset by a slightly bitter aftertaste not unlike northwestern ipas this was a pleasant surprise and again presents different flavor components with different water temperatures now onto the mixing process same for either brew and sodas and takes only about  minutes  open the bottle and remove the carbonator cup from the cap add a few ounces of water to the bottle replace the cap not carbonator cup and invert the bottle open and close the lever on the cap to half way  degrees  times until a little fluid seeps out this measures the correct amount of fluid into a small reservoir in the cap for the co activator packet uncap and add water to the bottle just below the oz mark  open the concentrated syrup and add the contents of the pouch in your choice of flavor to the pint of water rolling the packet like and energy gel pouch or toothpaste gently swirl the container to mix   open and pour in the activator pack into the carbonator cup fit that cup tightly back onto the underside of the cap   recap the bottle lift the lever  times to seep the reserved liquid into the activator powders lock the lever down and then shake back and fourth horizontally avoid inverting or shaking the bottle up and down for about two minutes  heres where i go rogue and stray from instructions after carbonation and mixing i let the bottle sit for about a minute with the carbonator lever half open  degrees this allows enough pressurized co to dissipate so that the brew remains nicely carbonated and ends up in youinstead of all over you  then open the bottle and enjoy the fresh taste of your own craft brewingwherever your adventures take you aug  update  new flavor  american logger  the lumberjack of beers theyve done it again this nicely hopped flavorful beverage is an excellent addition to the originals i found it to carbonate a little bit better and enjoyed several with some thruhikers on the appalachian trail traveler spitz and mikeif you read this it was great meeting you all and talking around the fire my hope is that pats backcountry beverages will continue to bring us more variety this is touted on their website as the most environmentallyresponsible carbonated beverage system on earth this awesome addition to your gear list is engineered with an emphasis on rugged durability and really is first of its kind  fun basically its your standard everyday water bottle yawn however when you decide to kick it into

could make the scene even better a refreshing beer or soda in hand unfortunately you left all of that stuff in the car because you dont want to lug the heavy cans all the way to your campsite what if there was another way thats the question that patrick tatera asked back in  and now his vision has finally come to fruition a portable carbonating system that you can use to make beer and soda anytime anywhere making beer from a powder doesnt sound very appetizing but pats backcountry beer isnt just beer that is made and then has its water removed thieir modern process patent pending allows them to start with almost no water and carefully control the environment of the fermentation the result… concentrated beer with all the same great taste you’re used to in a premium micro brew all you do is add water carbonate and enjoy  unfortunately we cant sell the beer concentrate at outdoor gear exchange because we dont have a liquor license we do carry various flavors of pats soda so grab the carbonator system some soda and youre ready for backcountry refreshment  reviews write your own review youre reviewing pats backcountry beverages  carbonator system let us know your thoughts summary
