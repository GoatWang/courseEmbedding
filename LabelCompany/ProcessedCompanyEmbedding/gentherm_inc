the microclimate sleep system require maintenanceq will the comfort of the mattress be compromised because of the microclimate technologyq can i use a mattress pad or a protector with the mattressq does the microclimate sleep system require unique bed dressingq does the microclimate sleep system include a warrantyq can the temperature be independently controlled from each sideq what is the temperature range that the microclimate sleep system can perform to q does the microclimate sleep system require maintenancea no maintenance is required because the microclimate sleep system utilizes air to provide cooling and heating to the sleep surface as such no fluids or compressed gasses are required to provide the desired thermal output the only maintenance required of the climate sleep system would be the need to change remote batteries and periodically rotate the mattress q will the comfort of the mattress be compromised because of the microclimate technologya absolutely not the first priority of the mattress is to provide a comfortable sleep environment our proprietary air distribution system used in conjunction with the highest quality bedding materials provides world class pressure relief and thermal management the cooling and heating hardware is located in the foundation far away from the occupant and does not require the use of bulky mats on the surface of the bed q can i use a mattress pad or a protector with the mattressa because of the nature of the product using air to cool or heat the occupant mattress covers are not recommended however weve designed the climate sleep system such that mattress covers will soon be a thing of the past our cover and foam layers are all treated with antimicrobial agents delivering thermal comfort via air also creates a dry environment which is proven to reduce the proliferation of dust mites and other unwanted organisms finally the cover is replaceable meaning you have the option to replace as often as you please q does the microclimate sleep system require unique bed dressinga not necessarily we all know how important the “feel” of the sheets are to the sleep experience understanding this requirement our technology has been tested with a wide variety of sheet styles and constructions jersey knit sheets provide the best performance in general the more “breathable” the sheets the better the performance q does the microclimate sleep system include a warrantya yes the technology in your microclimate sleep system has roots in the automotive industry and has been designed to the highest product reliability and safety standards terms of the warranty are located on this website q can the temperature be independently controlled from each sidea yes all individuals have their own thermal needs because of this our microclimate sleep system is designed to offer independent control without the worry of affecting your sleep partners personal microclimate q what is the temperature range that the microclimate sleep system can perform toa performance will vary with room temperature and bed dressing but the sleep system is designed to cool to  °f and heat to  °f csz a gentherm company
