close search supported by search mergers  acquisitions investment banking private equity hedge funds ipoofferings venture capital legalregulatory for crittenden a bad time to be at citigroup by cyrus sanati july    pm july    pm gary l crittenden the former chief financial officer of citigroup joined the bank in february  a few months before the subprime mortgage crisis erupted shaking the financial system at the time he told the new york times that this was “the best job i could ever imagine” three years later it is probably safe to assume that mr crittenden feels a bit differently about being the chief financial officer of citigroup he has agreed to pay a  fine to the securities and exchange commission to settle claims that he violating federal disclosure rules citigroup itself has agreed to pay  million to settle claims that it failed to disclose roughly  billion in holdings of subprime mortgage investments that crippled the bank during the financial crisis mr crittenden was not an accountant by training but had been chief financial officer of other companies before joining citigroup he graduated from brigham young university in  with a degree in management and then went on to harvard business school to earn his masters in business administration in  mr crittenden began his career as a consultant at bain  company where he worked on a number of strategic consulting projects his first job as chief financial officer was for sears roebuck in  he then left sears in  to be the chief financial officer of monsanto then in  mr crittenden took the chief financial officer role at american express where he would stay until he joined citigroup in  american express is a financial firm but it is very different from citigroup the mortgagebacked collateralized debt obligations and other complex securitized products that citigroup handled were probably foreign to mr crittenden “i don’t pretend to have any deep insight into citi” mr crittenden told the times when he became the bank’s chief financial officer ”but what i do know is the company has scope and scale and a brand that is very impressive” mr crittenden was replaced as chief financial officer in march  and made chief executive of citi holdings which is a depository for billions of dollars in assets that citigroup plans to sell in its effort to trim its bloated balance sheet mr crittenden did not spend too long in that role leaving just five months later to join a number of his former bain colleagues over at huntsman gay global capital a private equity firm mr crittenden remains at huntsman gay which raised more than  billion last year to do buyouts in the middle market the sec settlement comes a year after mr crittenden left citigroup but the  fine will probably tarnish mr crittenden’s name more than it will hurt his pocket book in  he took home nearly  million in total compensation from citigroup even though the company’s stock had fallen nearly  percent that year he then took home another  million worth of stock in  even though the bank nearly collapsed citigroup’s stock in total fell around  percent during mr crittenden’s time at the bank —
