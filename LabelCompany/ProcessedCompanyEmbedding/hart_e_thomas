subscribe april   e thomas hart focusing quicklogics energy by kevin morris tom hart took physics in school and was a bombardiernavigator in the us navy he knows that with proper focus you can take advantage of an exponential ratio to deliver many times more energy to a target than even a much larger unfocused source as chairman president and ceo of quicklogic he applies that same principle in leading his company to success in a programmable logic industry that is blasting its light in all directions trying to illuminate every square inch of the digital design landscape hart’s quicklogic is a spotlight concentrating its resources on solving specific high value problems better than anyone else in the designspecific semiconductor world there are highly specialized custom devices such as cellbased asics more general solutions like assps and extremely general solutions like fpgas quicklogic reasons that there is lots of room to work in the gap between the latter two assps and fpgas where assps solve one specific problem in one specific way and generalpurpose fpgas are a blank canvas for creating a complete solution on your own quicklogic’s embedded standard product esp devices merge these two worlds by locking the known stable parts of an application in optimized hardware blocks while providing a highperformance programmable fabric for adding your own custom components to the design in today’s world of rapidly evolving standards increased timetomarket pressure and high demands on silicon performance price and power this is often exactly what the doctor ordered hart is a passionate believer in quicklogic and in quicklogic’s strategy and its prospects for success in the dynamic fiercely competitive semiconductor market as we have lunch during the embedded systems conference in san francisco he is animated in his description of the market the technology and quicklogic’s role the food and service are excellent but hart a selfproclaimed wine and food enthusiast barely seems to notice his mind is in the conversation and on this topic he has homefield advantage “quicklogic’s patented vialink technology has several advantages over srambased fpga fabric and we look for opportunities where we can leverage those advantages in combination with welldesigned cores to create unique solutions which can be designed into highvolume systems” hart explains tom hart was captivated by electronics at an early age “from age seven or eight i knew i wanted to work in electronics” hart recalls “i got my first class radio telephone license at age  out of high school i went into the navy and got involved with avionics systems i was either regular or active in the naval reserves for the next thirtyseven years so the navy played an important part in my life and career” hart retired from the navy in  as a captain in naval intelligence after his first active stint with the navy hart attended university of washington where he got his ee degree in  after uw he went to work for motorola in the linear ic group “as much as i enjoyed the technology i was also very interested in the business side of things” hart continues “i ended up running motorola’s linear ic unit until  when i left to go to silicon general” hart stayed at silicon general until  when he left to do a communications startup he spent the next fifteen years in various entrepreneurial ventures and in technology investment banking and then went on to run national semiconductor’s asic and advanced networks business in  in  he joined quicklogic where he has held the reins ever since quicklogic was founded in  and shipped their first silicon in  but by  the company found itself at a crossroads at about the same time the company set a new course in the direction that defines their identity today – embedded standard products “we wanted to look beyond being just another programmable logic company” says hart “by focusing on embedded standard products we were able to take advantage of our programmable logic heritage and our unique architecture to create a new category of semiconductor solution” hart took on additional responsibility as chairman of the board of quicklogic in  the company wanted to differentiate itself by offering compelling solutions to its customers that could not be found elsewhere in the market on one side were applicationspecific standard products assps that offered very highperformance lowcost solutions to established problems on the other side were asic and programmable logic devices that offered maximum flexibility for solving new emerging problems but at a significant cost in either design time or silicon area hart’s strategy with quicklogic was to select applications where standards were still emerging and evolving and thus assps had not yet commoditized the market but where significant parts of the solution were known and fixed so there was economy of scale in creating tightly crafted solutions quicklogic’s onetimeprogrammable vialink technology creates metaltometal connections for device personalization compared with sram fpga fabric where customization is volatile and depends on sram cells the technology offers faster interconnect lower static and dynamic power consumption higher interconnect density and nonvolatility the tradeoff for these benefits is a lack of insystem or even outofsystem reprogrammability these characteristics make the technology well suited for applications that need the benefits of an assp where none yet exists low unit cost high operating frequency very low power consumption and singlechip nonvolatile operation combined with customizability to produce devices with assplike cost and performance but fpgalike flexibility with a spotlight you get excellent results only when you aim it intelligently hart is quick to acknowledge that the success or failure of quicklogic depends heavily on what types of applications they choose to target “we want to find highvolume rapidgrowth areas where standards are in flux and timetomarket is critical” hart explains in some cases such as the company’s eclipse fpga lines that is a simple matter of identifying classes of problems that other suppliers don’t readily solve eclipse’s extremely low static power consumption makes it a viable fpga option for many types of powerlimited applications where traditional sram fpgas cannot compete quicklogic categorizes their solutions as lowpower programmable logic solutions consisting of microwatt fpgas quickmips programmable socs and microwatt programmable bridges eclipse ii which the company claims is the industry’s lowest power fpga family includes both standard and militarygrade fpgas the quickmips family combines a mips bit processor peripherals memory and pci and ethernet interfaces with customizable fpga fabric the embedded systemonchip is ready to run and the fpga fabric can be used for hardware acceleration of performancecritical algorithms such as video compressiondecompression or like a traditional standalone fpga for bridging nonstandard interfaces with the onchip embedded system in the bridging solutions department the quickpci product line offers solutions for pci minipci and cardbus applications and new quickide and quicksdio families are set for introduction in q  q of this year quickpci is based on the same idea as quickmips but with a leaner combination of an optimized pci core with programmable fabric this creates a broadly applicable pcitoanything device with the lowpower lowcost benefits of a microwatt fpga built in recently quicklogic has signaled their intention to push into the ubiquitous wifi market by announcing a partnership with renesas to develop chipsets for voip and batterypowered ag applications quicklogic and atheros a leader in the single chip wifi market also recently announced their partnership which is aimed at expanding atheros’ ability to service the embedded systems markets with their single chip pci based wifi solution while these initiatives haven’t yet put quicklogic in the lead in the fpga race hart isn’t worried “in this business change happens quickly” hart observes “all the industry giants started as energetic small companies” hart is right fifteen years ago it would have been difficult to predict today’s dominant electronics companies fifteen years from now who knows tom hart’s
