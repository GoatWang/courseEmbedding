from coastal waterways no other floating dock system in the world outperforms the gatordock full float system   pontoon float during our decades of research and development we invented the pontoon floating dock using a proprietary polyurethane injection system the aluminum float shells are filled with durable foam it is important to note that both the full float and the pontoon float use polyurethane foam rather than polystyrene for buoyancy whereas polystyrene foam similar to styrofoam can dissolve and degrade when exposed to common chemicals found in marine environments our polyurethane foam will remain intact even if exposed to boat fuels and marine chemicals gator pontoon docks are ideally suited for areas with moderate traffic and are popular on boat ramp docks   polytub float these economical plastic tubs are filled with polystyrene foam and bolted to the dock frame whereas the aluminum casings for the full float and pontoon floatation systems are welded on

is even possible to combine gators superior floatation options with a concrete deck to make a hybrid aluminum and concrete dock system pavers are another decking style available synthetic concrete concrete decking has its challenges especially when it comes to cracking and weight gator’s synthetic concrete deck solves these issues as well as provides a minimal maintenance durable decking solution that looks like concrete the fiberglass panels look like concrete and provide a slip resistant surface for our docks fenders fenders are an attractive frame protection system that can be matched to the decking style for a clean sophisticated look choose from pressure treated pine ipe hardwood composite decking or uhmw strips for your floating dock fender bumpers our hdpe bumpers wrap all the way around the exposed sides of the frame protecting boats from the aluminum dock frame and float we offer two styles a smaller p bumper with corner pieces or a larger d bumper that is mitered at the frame corners cleats gator can incorporate any cleat style into the design of your dock system we have a few of our own favorites including a  inch aluminum cleat that can be bolted or welded to the dock frame utilities utility chases run the length of each of our floating docks and piers these chases allow easy access and installation to water electricity or other utility lines utility access panels can be designed into your boat dock as a custom feature railing we fabricate several rail styles at our manufacturing plant railing is often used to approach a dock float system or can be incorporated into the dock system itself to learn about our available rail style view our dock resources other accessories enhance your dock with gates aluminum benches roof systems knee bracing or dock section connections as a custom dock builder we can fabricate any aluminum structure you can design internal pile guides gatordocks standard internal pile guide is made from a frame and four uhmw plastic rollers there are upgrade options and protective design features available when choosing to design your floating dock with internal pile guides external pile guides there are two main options when choosing to anchor your floating dock with external pile guides first an enclosed four roller external pile guide provides smooth movement during water fluctuations next a structural dring hoop with a uhmw plastic roller can be attached to the side of the floating aluminum frame several customizations of these standard options may also be available other anchoring floating docks can be physically anchored to land through a strong arm style system or anchored to the waters floor through chain or a seaflex style system talk with one of our floating dock experts to discuss these other anchoring options and determine the best solution for your aluminum dock needs timberguard piles timberguard® is made from lightly treated southern yellow pine encased in a polymer plastic this application does not adhere to the wood allowing the piling to expand and contract during temperature changes without compromising the integrity of the casing this system has no harmful effects on the water or surrounding environment yet still can be constructed like you would with wood pilings and beams ultracomposite piles our composite pilings also known as frp piles can also be used to support your floating dock system our composite piles are better alternative than steel piles as they will not rust and do not require toxic paintings or coatings why aluminum anatomy of a dock contact us
