important role in building systems”  mb download pdf of grove products product list “grove products inc  product list”  kb download pdf of grove products detailed shim information chart  kb properties of shims size the most important properties of shims are their ability to separate and adjust the spacing between items in construction the thickness of a shim is chosen according to the depth of the space it is intended to maintain the footprint is chosen according to handling and load distribution needs a permanent shim should be sized to fit entirely within the joint behind the finish materials and without interfering with any sealant that can be installed in the joint shape • flat blocks are used for simple conditions where spaces will be later filled with grout or sealant such as joints in tilt up concrete panel construction • ushapes fit around bolts and are useful for many systems of construction including precast concrete cladding and curtain wall systems • wedges are used anywhere wood is inappropriate and a gap needs filling compressive strength choose compressive strength that can withstand the expected dead loads construction loads and live loads that the shim will carry shims carry large loads over their small footprints during construction before the final fastening is complete so including a factor of safety is a good idea see shim properties chart for compressive strengths available with different materials test reports are available creep shims with compressive strength adequate to the task at hand wont deform under the expected loads by contrast materials like wood suffer from creep deformation overtime forcing installers to guess at the final compressed thickness when selecting shims choosing structural shims takes the guesswork out of installation it is worth noting that creep can be a problem with highdensity polyethylene used as permanent support resilience resilience is the ability of a shim to compress under load then return to its previous shape when the load is released it is expressed in rockwell hardness and shore d hardness resilience is often required in glazing systems and other panelized cladding systems when materials being separated are brittle like glass or stone the shims job is to absorb some of the load imposed by movement of the system consult glass association of north america gana standards for glazing systems and manufacturers recommendations for other materials impact resistance impact resistance is the shims ability to withstand a sudden force usually over a small area without breaking or crushing impact resistance is often required for shims used to install glazing systems when high impact resistance is required highimpact polystyrene or pvc shims are often required resistance to brittle failure if very cold temperatures are expected during construction or the service life of the shim brittle failure needs to be considered the temperature at which cracking occurs should be below the expected ambient temperature in some conditions the shim can be retained in the joint with adhesive making cracking less of a concern fire resistance shims that will remain permanently within an assembly may be required to be fireresistant in these cases the following criteria may apply • melting point not less than ° f astm d • flame spread class a under  class b  class c  astm e • smoke developed  or less for classes a b and c astm e • noncombustiblity passfail astm e • ul  v normally for computer components is available for special requirements compatibility a compatible material does not react with or chemically affect the materials it touches it will not transfer color or oils produce stains nor corrode the item being shimmed it will also be unaffected by the adjacent materials polypropylene and polystyrene both excel in this feature being unaffected by most construction materials in fact inert plastics are often used to separate dissimilar materials that would otherwise react with each other separating aluminum from concrete for instance or aluminum from steel vermin and decay resistance inert plastic shims can remain in place indefinitely without contributing nutrients to unwanted organisms like mold or insects unlike wood and wood products grove structural shims do not rot or degrade ease of use • color coding shims are colored by thickness simplifying and speeding selection and inspection in the field • stackability stackable shims can fit virtually any size joint from  to  by combining standard sizes grove structural shims can be banded together they also are readily heatwelded at the edges forming a permanent stack custombuilt for the joint required • fitting in order to fit joint requirements shims should be available in a variety of widths and in shapes that are easily cut to size grove structural shims offers inch and inch wedge shims that are notched to be snapped at convenient lengths and depths thermal performance shims can act as a thermal break between conductive materials measured in btu per hour or in watts the thermal conductance of plastic is lower than that of aluminum or steel  for example shims can help reduce thermal transfer from cladding materials such as precast concrete into structural elements common types of construction work using shims in general shims are used to hold heavy objects in place until they are permanently attached with bolts welding grout adhesive or other methods examples of this use occur in many areas of construction the list below is not exhaustive but serves to demonstrate the versatility of shims division  tiltup concrete level and align panels in preparation for final attachment precast concrete panels align panels vertically and horizontally and maintain joint spacings before final attachment division  stone masonry temporary and permanent joint spacing stone panel cladding align panels vertically and horizontally to relieve stress while mortar sets terra cotta brittle materials can be temporarily cushioned with shims before being fixed or sealed into place division  typically structural steel is shimmed with steel shims however many other metal objects are shimmed temporarily with plastic shims before welding grouting or bolting into place plastic shims can also separate dissimilar metals or provide a thermal break division  heavy wood member that would crush a wood shim can be shimmed with plastic shim typical applications include heavy timber framing glulam members and prefabricated joists or trusses division  wall and roof panels align panels girts and purlins division  doors and frames align frames while fastening in place entrance storefront and curtain wall systems align members or panels vertically and horizontally

before being permanently fixed into place specifying shims general shims are considered accessories and are appropriately specified with other parts of each building system products review the criteria listed above and include specification necessary to assure proper performance for project conditions it is usually unnecessary for the specifier to require a specific shape or size of shim when load bearing is important specify that shims shall be solid and that hollowed profiles will not be accepted execution execution requirements for shims should also be resultsoriented example requirements may include • shims shall not remain permanently exposed to view sun or weather • hold shims back from face of panel at least two times joint width for mortar or grout joints • shims shall not intrude into depth required for sealant and backer rod specified for sealant joints • remove shims progressively as sealant is installed for movement joints in stone flooring • install shims
