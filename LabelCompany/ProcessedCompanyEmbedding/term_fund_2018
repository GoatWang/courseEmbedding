the ishares® ibonds® etfs funds will terminate on or about march  of the year in each fund’s name an investment in the funds is not guaranteed and an investor may experience losses including near or at the termination date unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity the funds will make distributions of income that vary over time in the final months of each fund’s operation as the bonds it holds mature its portfolio will transition to cash and cashlike instruments as a result its yield will tend to move toward prevailing money market rates and may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the fund and lower than prevailing yields in the bond market following the fund’s termination date the fund will distribute substantially all of its net assets after deduction of any liabilities to thencurrent investors without further notice and will no longer be listed or traded the funds’ distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of investment and the funds do not seek to return any predetermined amount the rate of fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of an investor’s returns from an investment in the fund relative to a direct investment in bonds if the amount an investor receives as liquidation proceeds upon the fund’s termination is higher or lower than the investor’s cost basis the investor may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes performance shown reflects fee waivers andor expense reimbursements by the investment advisor to the

a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity the funds will make distributions of income that vary over time in the final months of each fund’s operation as the bonds it holds mature its
