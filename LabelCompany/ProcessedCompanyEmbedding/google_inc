based on users’ search requestssearching for businessbrin and page who met as graduate students at stanford university were intrigued with the idea of extracting meaning from the mass of data accumulating on the internet they began working from page’s dormitory room at stanford to devise a new type of search technology which they dubbed backrub the key was to leverage web users’ own ranking abilities by tracking each web site’s “backing links”—that is the number of other pages linked to them most search engines simply returned a list of web sites ranked by how often a search phrase appeared on them brin and page incorporated into the search function the number of links each web site had ie a web site with thousands of links would logically be more valuable than one with just a few links and the search engine thus would place the heavily linked site higher on a list of possibilities further a link from a heavily linked web site would be a more valuable “vote” than one from a more obscure web site similar topics netflix inc facebook apple inc disney company amazoncom walmart microsoft corporation twitter tesla motors vodafone in mid brin and page began receiving

together an index of web pages that contain the words “chicago” “theatre” and “participatory” test your knowledge important locations in us history the extraordinary growth of google led to internal management problems almost from the beginning investors felt that brin and page needed an experienced manager at the helm and in  they agreed to hire eric schmidt as chairman and chief executive officer ceo of the company schmidt who previously had held the same positions at the software company novell inc had a doctorate in computer science and melded well with the technocratic impulses of

google video which enabled individuals to search the closecaptioned text from television broadcasts a few months later google began accepting usersubmitted videos with submitters setting the prices for others to download and view the videos in january  google video store opened featuring premium content from traditional media companies such as cbs corporation television shows and sony corporation movies in june  google began offering premium content for free but with adsfor all of its marketing advantages however google was unable to overtake the upstart leader in online videos youtube following its introduction in  youtube quickly become the favourite site for users to upload small video files some of which attracted millions of viewers unable to generate anything close to the same number of uploads and viewers google bought youtube in  for  billion in stock rather than merge the web sites however google continued youtube’s operation as a separate entity despite estimated revenues of more than  billion by  google said youtube remained an “investment” and has not said whether the division was profitablegmail connect with britannica facebook twitter youtube instagram pinterest in  google began offering a free webbased email account to select “beta” testers a beta product being a product not yet in its final form the service known as gmail was opened to the general public in  while still officially in its beta stage one of the main appeals of gmail was that it gave users an email address that was independent of any particular internet service provider isp thus making it easier to maintain a permanent address in addition the service offered an unprecedented one gigabyte one billion bytes of free email storage space though users were also presented with advertisements based on keywords that the google search engine found in their messages google later expanded the amount of free storage space given to users to seven gigabytes and allowed users to rent additional space in  the company acquired postini an email services firm for  million in order to improve gmail’s security especially in google’s efforts to sign up businesses in  google removed the beta status of gmail increasing its appeal to business usersin january  google announced that it had detected a series of sophisticated hacking attacks originating in china that were directed at the gmail accounts of chinese human rights activists and foreign journalists working in china in some cases the accounts had been reconfigured to forward all incoming and outgoing email to unfamiliar addresses google’s immediate response was to change gmail’s protocol from the web standard http to the encrypted https which increased security at the expense of speed the attacks also led google to threaten to reverse its stance which allowed the chinese government to censor its googlecn site and allow chinese users to receive unfiltered search results this brought the company into conflict with the chinese government and raised the possibility of google’s exiting the chinese market altogether in march google avoided direct conflict by automatically redirecting chinese users of googlecn to its unfiltered hong kong site googlecomhk this arrangement continued until google’s governmentissued license to operate in china came up for annual renewal at the end of june at that time google changed googlecn so that users could either use the censored chinese site for services such as music search or manually click on a link to googlecomhk for web search this move conciliated the chinese government which renewed google’s license in july google books trending topics dunkirk evacuation pangea truth cold war sir isaac newton france communism world war ii industrial revolution list of cities and towns in the united states before google was even launched as a company its founders had worked on digital book projects at stanford and had always envisioned the day when internet users would be able to search content in books in  the company announced google print a project with several major libraries around the world that would begin to make their holdings freely available on the internet the company began by scanning publicdomain books from the libraries’ collections using sophisticated equipment the digital files were then converted into portable document files pdfs that were fully searchable downloadable and printable works still in copyright appeared only in fragmented “snippet” form in  the company changed the name of the project to google books and about one million books per year were scanned in its initial years of operation as of  google had scanned more than  million booksmeanwhile groups of authors and publishers filed suit to stop the company from making passages from their copyrighted books available over the internet in  google reached a legal settlement in which the company agreed to pay the groups  million for past transgressions though users could continue to read for free up to  percent of each work scanned by google in exchange for allowing parts of their works to be read online the authors and publishers would receive  percent of all advertising revenue generated by page views of their material on google’s web sitegoogle earthin  google bought keyhole inc which was partially funded by the central intelligence agency’s venture capital arm inqtel keyhole had developed an online mapping service that google rebranded in  as google earth this service let users find detailed satellite images of most locations on earth and also create combinations known as “mashups” with various other databases incorporating details such as street names weather patterns crime statistics coffee shop locations realestate prices and population densities into maps created by google earth while many of these mashups were created for convenience or simple novelty others became critical lifesaving tools for instance in the wake of hurricane katrina in  google earth provided interactive satellite overlays of the affected region enabling rescuers to better understand the extent of the damage

googlegoogle’s commitment to privacy was questioned however after it introduced a related mapping service called street view that showed streetlevel photographs first from around the united states and later from other countries that were searchable by street address some photographs provided a view through house windows or showed persons sunbathing google defended the service by saying that the images showed only what a person could see if walking down the street in response to privacy concerns in germany in  google allowed people to opt out of having their homes and business included in street view and  people  percent of the country did so however even though a german court ruled in  that street view was legal google announced that it would not add new photographs to the

salvo in a war with microsoft google introduced google apps—application software hosted by google that runs through users’ web browsers the first free programs included google calendar a scheduling program google talk an instant messaging program and google page creator a webpagecreation program in order to use these free programs users viewed advertisements and stored their data on google’s equipment this type of deployment in which both the data and the programs are located somewhere on the internet is often called cloud computingscreenshot of a web page at googlecom describing the google apps computer application  googlebetween  and  google bought or developed various traditional business programs word processor spreadsheet and presentation software that were eventually collectively named google docs like google apps google docs is used through a browser that connects to the data on google’s machines in  google introduced a premier edition of its google apps that included  gigabytes of email storage security functions from the recently acquired postini software and no advertisements as the components of google docs became available they were added to both the free adsupported google apps and the premier edition in particular google docs was marketed as a direct competitor to microsoft’s office suite word excel and powerpointin  google released chrome a web browser with an advanced javascript engine better suited for running programs within the browser the following year the company announced plans to develop an opensource operating system known as chrome os the first devices to use chrome os were released in  and were netbooks called chromebooks chrome os which runs on top of a linux kernel requires fewer system resources than most operating systems because it uses cloud computing the only software running on a chrome os device is the chrome browser all other software applications being supplied by google appsandroid operating systemgoogle’s entry into the lucrative mobile operating system market was based on its acquisition in  of android inc which at that time had not released any products two years later google announced the founding of the open handset alliance a consortium of dozens of technology and mobile telephone companies including intel corporation motorola inc nvidia corporation texas instruments incorporated lg electronics inc samsung electronics sprint nextel corporation and tmobile deutsche telekom the consortium was created in order to develop and promote android a free opensource operating system based on linux the first phone to feature the new operating system was the tmobile g released in october  though androidbased phones really required the more capable thirdgeneration g wireless

operating system displayed in dan steinbergapin  google entered into direct competition with apple’s iphone by introducing the nexus one smartphone nicknamed the “google phone” the nexus one used the latest version of android and featured a large vibrant display screen aesthetically pleasing design and a voicetotext messaging system that was based on advanced voicerecognition software however its lack of native support for multitouch—a typing and navigation feature pioneered by apple that allowed users more flexibility in interacting with touchscreens—was seen as a drawback when compared with other handsets in its class despite android’s perceived drawbacks compared with apple’s smartphone ios by the end of  android led the mobile phone industry with a  percent global market share more

tablet computers based on the android operating system the first product was criticized for poor performance but by the end of  androidbased tablets had gained ground on the hugely popular apple ipad of the  million tablets estimated to have shipped in that year  percent ran android compared with nearly  percent being ipadsgoogle was obliged to battle competitors over android in the courts as well as in the marketplace in  for example oracle corporation sued google for  billion in damages claiming android had violated numerous patents relating to oracle’s java programming language after two years in court google eventually won the lawsuit instead of attacking google directly apple inc sued makers of android smartphones such as htc motorola mobility and samsung over alleged patent violations apple ceo steve jobs was said to have claimed “i’m going to destroy android because it’s a stolen product i’m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this” the patent wars over mobile operating systems seemed unresolvable as suits and countersuits were filed with each release of a new versionsocial networks and googlegoogle was late to recognize the popularity and advertising potential of social networks such as facebook and twitter its first attempt to create a social network google buzz started in  and closed less than two years later among several problems the network was limited to users who had gmail accounts and it created privacy issues by featuring a default setting that showed a user’s profile to anyone even before google buzz had shut down the company launched google in june  at first to a limited audience and then to anyone within a year of its start the social network service had attracted more than  million users facebook by contrast had taken five years to reach  million usersnevertheless google faced a formidable competitor in facebook which by mid had some  million users facebook users spent far more time on their site clocking six to seven hours per month while google users averaged a little more than three minutes per month because facebook did not permit google’s web indexing software to penetrate its servers google was unable to include the giant social network in its search results thus losing potentially valuable data from one of the mosttrafficked networks on the internet still the company appeared to be fully supportive of google seeing the value of games in retaining users on social networks it quickly released a games area for the service it also developed innovative features that were not available on facebook for example with hangouts users could instantly create free video conferences for up to  people the company also added google pages for businesses to market their products and brandswilliam l

and more popular when several other big dotcom companies were struggling including the yahoos and the aols of the web google never had to look back as it enjoyed a monopoly in the search engine market just like microsoft monopolized the operating systems market in the s and s the best thing about google from the user point of view is that they launched a ton of other products  services apart from a search engine and gave away all of them for free because they were able to subsidize all its cost via their highly profitable advertising business when google started launching more and more web products i was superexcited as i saw myself using almost all of them and that’s what inspired me to publish this listicle please share with me any other interesting google productservice or even a
