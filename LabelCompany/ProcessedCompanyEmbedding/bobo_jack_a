that its founder jasper newton jack daniel was born in  and his tombstone bears that date but says his exact birth date is unknown the company website says it is customary to celebrate his birthday in september the tennessee state library website said in  that records list his birth date as september   and that the  birth date seems impossible since his mother died in  in the  biography blood  whiskey the life and times of jack daniel author peter krass said his investigation showed that daniel was born in january  based on jacks sisters diary census records and the date of death of jacks mother jack was one of  children fathered by calaway daniel and was the youngest of his mothers  children after daniels mother lucinda cook daniel died his father remarried and had several more children jack daniels grandfather joseph job daniel emigrated from wales along with his scottish wife elizabeth calaway to the united states he was of welsh scottish english and scotsirish descent daniels father died in the civil war and he despised his stepmother and as a result he ran away from home and was essentially orphaned at a young age statue of jack daniel in front of the subterranean fresh water spring from whence he once drew the water for producing his whiskey jack daniels distillery lynchburg tennessee as a teenager daniel was taken in by a local lay preacher and moonshine distiller named dan call and began learning the distilling trade from call and his master distiller nearest green an enslaved african american man who continued to work with him after emancipation in  on receiving an inheritance from his fathers estate following a long dispute with his siblings daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with call he took over the distillery shortly afterward when call quit for religious reasons the brand label on the product says est  reg in  but his biographer has cited official registration documents to assert that the business was not established until  after taking over the distillery in  daniel purchased the hollow and land where the distillery is now located by the s jack daniels was one of  distilleries operating in moore county and the secondmost productive behind tom eatons distillery he began using squareshaped bottles in  with the square shape of the bottle intended to convey a sense of fairness and integrity according to daniels biographer the origin of the old no  brand name was the number assigned to daniels distillery for government registration he was forced to change the registration number when the federal government redrew the district and he became number  in district  instead of no  in district  however he continued to use his original number as a brand name since his brand reputation already had been established jack daniels experienced a surge in popularity after the whiskey received the gold medal for the finest whiskey at the  st louis worlds fair although his local reputation was suffering as the temperance movement was gaining strength jack daniel never married and did not have any children however he took his nephews under his wing – one of whom was lemuel lem motlow – lem a son of daniels sister finetta was skilled with numbers and was soon doing all of the distillerys bookkeeping in  due to failing health jack daniel gave the distillery to two of his nephews motlow soon bought out the other nephew and went on to operate the distillery for about  years ad for old no  from a may  issue of the nashville globe tennessee passed a statewide prohibition law in  effectively barring the legal distillation of jack daniels within the state motlow challenged the law in a test case that eventually worked its way to the tennessee supreme court the court upheld the law as constitutional however daniel died in  from blood poisoning an ofttold tale is that the infection began in one of his toes which daniel injured one early morning at work by kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open he was said to always have had trouble remembering the combination however daniels modern biographer has asserted that the story is not true because of the prohibition in tennessee the company began distilling operations in st louis missouri and birmingham alabama though none of the production from these locations was ever sold due to quality problems the alabama operation was halted following a similar statewide prohibition law in that state and the st louis operation was halted by the onset of nationwide prohibition following passage of the eighteenth amendment in  while the passage of the twentyfirst amendment in  repealed prohibition at the federal level state prohibition laws including tennessees remained in effect thus preventing the lynchburg distillery from reopening motlow who had become a tennessee state senator led efforts to repeal these laws allowing production to restart in  the fiveyear gap between national repeal and tennessee repeal was commemorated in  with a gift pack of two bottles one for the th anniversary of the end of prohibition and a second commemorating the th anniversary of the reopening of the distillery the replica home of lem motlow proprietor of jack daniels from  to  the original home was demolished in  and rebuilt to the likeness of lem motlows house at jack daniels distillery in lynchburg the jack daniels distillery ceased operations from  to  when the us government banned the manufacture of whiskey due to world war ii motlow resumed production of jack daniels in  after goodquality corn was again available motlow died the same year he bequeathed the distillery to his children robert reagor dan conner and mary upon his death the company was later incorporated as jack daniel distillery lem motlow prop inc this has allowed the company to continue to include lem motlow who died in  in its marketing since mentioning him in the advertising is technically just citing the full corporate name likewise the advertisements continue to use lynchburgs sera population figure of  though the city has since formed a consolidated citycounty government with moore county and its official population had thus grown to over  by the  census the company was sold to the brownforman corporation in  the jack daniels distillery was listed on the national register of historic places in  in  a welshman mark evans claimed to have discovered the original recipe for daniels whiskey in a book written in  by his greatgreatgrandmother whose brotherinlaw emigrated to tennessee moore county where the jack

 us proof  alcohol by volume the lowerend green label product was  proof however starting in  the other label variations also were reduced in proof this began with black label being initially reduced to  proof both the black and green label expressions are made from the same ingredients the difference is determined by professional tasters who decide which of the batches would be sold under the premium black label with the rest being sold as standard green label a further dilution began in  when all generally available jack daniels products were reduced to  proof including the black label which had been  proof since  and was  proof before that thus further lowering production costs and excise taxes this reduction in alcohol content which was done without any announcement publicity or change of logo or packaging was noticed and condemned by modern drunkard magazine and the magazine formed a petition drive for drinkers who disagreed with the change the company countered that they believed consumers preferred lowerproof products and said that the change had not hurt the sales of the brand the petition effort garnered some publicity and collected more than  signatures but the company held firm with its decision a few years later advertising age said in  that virtually no one noticed the change and confirmed that sales of the brand had actually increased since the dilution began though it does not suppose any causes for that increase jack daniels has also produced higherproof special releases and premiumbrand expressions at times a onetime limited run of  proof the

jack daniels is made from corn rye and malted barley and is distilled in copper stills it is then filtered through foot  m stacks of sugar maple charcoal the company refers to this filtering step as mellowing this extra step known as the lincoln county process removes impurities and the taste of corn the company argues this extra step makes the product different from bourbon however tennessee whiskey is required to be a straight bourbon whiskey under terms of the north american free trade agreement and canadian law a distinctive aspect of the filtering process is that the jack daniels brand grinds its charcoal before using it for filtering after the filtering the whiskey is stored in newly handcrafted oak barrels which give the whiskey its color and most of its flavor the product label mentions that it is a sour mash whiskey which means that when the mash is prepared some of the wet solids from a previously used batch are mixed in to help make the fermentation process operate more consistently this is common practice in american whiskey production as of update all currently produced straight bourbon is produced using the sour mash process after being used for the aging of jack daniels whiskey many barrels go to scotland to be used in the production of scotch whisky some barrels are leased from glenmorangie distillery some of the barrels are sold to mcilhenny company of avery island louisiana for production of tabasco sauce and to both the mount gay rum company of barbados and appleton estate of jamaica for use in the aging process of their distinctively flavored

tennessee whiskey it is not enough under state law that the whiskey be produced in tennessee it must meet quality and production standards these are the same standards used by jack daniels distillery and some other distillers are displeased with the requirements being enshrined into law on may   tennessee governor bill haslam signed house bill  requiring the lincoln county process to be used for products produced in the state labeling themselves as tennessee whiskey with a particular exception tailored to exempt benjamin prichards and including the existing requirements for bourbon as federal law requires statements of origin on labels to be accurate the tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to tennessee whiskey requiring tennessee origin maple charcoal filtering by the lincoln county process prior to aging and the basic requirements of bourbon at least  corn new oak barrels charring of the barrels and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation aging and bottling in  legislation was introduced in the tennessee legislature that would modify the  law to allow the reuse of oak barrels in the tennessee whiskey aging process jack daniels master distiller jeff arnett vehemently opposed the legislation arguing the reuse of barrels would require the use of artificial colorings and flavorings and would render tennessee whiskey an inferior product to scotches and bourbons the company also has been the subject of a proposal to locally surtax its productwhen it is claimed that the distillery which is the main employer in a company town has capitalized on the bucolic image of lynchburg tennessee and it ought to pay a tax of  per barrel the company responded that such a tax is a confiscatory imposition penalizing it for the success of the

his exact birth date is unknown the company website says it is customary to celebrate his birthday in september the tennessee state library website said in  that records list his birth date as september   and that the  birth date seems impossible since his mother died in  in the  biography blood  whiskey the life and times of jack daniel author peter krass said his investigation showed that daniel was born in january  based on jacks sisters diary census records and the date of death of jacks mother jack was one of  children fathered by calaway daniel and was the youngest of his mothers  children after daniels mother lucinda cook daniel died his father remarried and had several more children jack daniels grandfather joseph job daniel emigrated from wales along with his scottish wife elizabeth calaway to the united states he was of welsh scottish english and scotsirish descent daniels father died in the civil war and he despised his stepmother and as a result he ran away from home and was essentially orphaned at a young age statue of jack daniel in front of the subterranean fresh water spring from whence he once drew the water for producing his whiskey jack daniels distillery lynchburg tennessee as a teenager daniel was taken in by a local lay preacher and moonshine distiller named dan call and began learning the distilling trade from call and his master distiller nearest green an enslaved african american man who continued to work with him after emancipation in  on receiving an inheritance from his fathers estate following a long dispute with his siblings daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with call he took over the distillery shortly afterward when call quit for religious reasons the brand label on the product says est  reg in  but his biographer has cited official registration documents to assert that the business was not established until  after taking over the distillery in  daniel purchased the hollow and land where the distillery is now located by the s jack daniels was one of  distilleries operating in moore county and the secondmost productive behind tom eatons distillery he began using squareshaped bottles in  with the square shape of the bottle intended to convey a sense of fairness and integrity according to daniels biographer the origin of the old no  brand name was the number assigned to daniels distillery for government registration he was forced to change the registration number when the federal government redrew the district and he became number  in district  instead of no  in district  however he continued to use his original number as a brand name since his brand reputation already had been established jack daniels experienced a surge in popularity after the whiskey received the gold medal for the finest whiskey at the  st louis worlds fair although his local reputation was suffering as the temperance movement was gaining strength jack daniel never married and did not have any children however he took his nephews under his wing – one of whom was lemuel lem motlow – lem a son of daniels sister finetta was skilled with numbers and was soon doing all of the distillerys bookkeeping in  due to failing health jack daniel gave the distillery to two of his nephews motlow soon bought out the other nephew and went on to operate the distillery for about  years ad for old no  from a may  issue of the nashville globe tennessee passed a statewide prohibition law in  effectively barring the legal distillation of jack daniels within the state motlow challenged the law in a test case that eventually worked its way to the tennessee supreme court the court upheld the law as constitutional however daniel died in  from blood poisoning an ofttold tale is that the infection began in one of his toes which daniel injured one early morning at work by kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open he was said to always have had trouble remembering the combination however daniels modern biographer has asserted that the story is not true because of the prohibition in tennessee the company began distilling operations in st louis missouri and birmingham alabama though none of the production from these locations was ever sold due to quality problems the alabama operation was halted following a similar statewide prohibition law in that state and the st louis operation was halted by the onset of nationwide prohibition following passage of the eighteenth amendment in  while the passage of the twentyfirst amendment in  repealed prohibition at the federal level state prohibition laws including tennessees remained in effect thus preventing the lynchburg distillery from reopening motlow who had become a tennessee state senator led efforts to repeal these laws allowing production to restart in  the fiveyear gap between national repeal and tennessee repeal was commemorated in  with a gift pack of two bottles one for the th anniversary of the end of prohibition and a second commemorating the th anniversary of the reopening of the distillery the replica home of lem motlow proprietor of jack daniels from  to  the original home was demolished in  and rebuilt to the likeness of lem motlows house at jack daniels distillery in lynchburg the jack daniels distillery ceased operations from  to  when the us government banned the manufacture of whiskey due to world war ii motlow resumed production of jack daniels in  after goodquality corn was again available motlow died the same year he bequeathed the distillery to his children robert reagor dan conner and mary upon his death the company was later incorporated as jack daniel distillery lem motlow prop inc this has allowed the company to continue to include lem motlow who died in  in its marketing since mentioning him in the advertising is technically just citing the full corporate name likewise the advertisements continue to use lynchburgs sera population figure of  though the city has since formed a consolidated citycounty government with moore county and its official population had thus grown to over  by the  census the company was sold to the brownforman corporation in  the jack daniels distillery was listed on the national register of historic places in  in  a welshman mark evans claimed to have discovered the original recipe for daniels whiskey in a book written in  by his greatgreatgrandmother whose brotherinlaw emigrated to tennessee moore county where the jack daniels distillery is located is one of the states many dry counties therefore while it is legal to distill the product within the county it is illegal to purchase it there however a state law has provided one exception a distillery may sell one commemorative product regardless of county statutes

historyedit lowering to  proofedit until  jack daniels black label was historically produced at  us proof  alcohol by volume the lowerend green label product was  proof however starting in  the other label variations also were reduced in proof this began with black label being initially reduced to  proof both the black and green label expressions are made from the same ingredients the difference is determined by professional tasters who decide which of the batches would be sold under the premium black label with the rest being sold as standard green label a further dilution began in  when all generally available jack daniels products were reduced to  proof including the black label which had been  proof since  and was  proof before that thus further lowering production costs and excise taxes this reduction in alcohol content which was done without any announcement publicity or change of logo or packaging was noticed and condemned by modern drunkard magazine and the magazine formed a petition drive for drinkers who disagreed with the change the company countered that they believed consumers preferred lowerproof products and said that the change had not hurt the sales of the brand the petition effort garnered some publicity and collected more than  signatures but the company held firm with its decision a few years later advertising age said in  that virtually no one noticed the change and confirmed that sales of the brand had actually increased since the dilution began though it does not suppose any causes for that increase jack daniels has also produced higherproof special releases and premiumbrand expressions at times a onetime limited run of  proof the highest proof jack daniels had ever bottled at that time was bottled for the  tennessee bicentennial in a decorative

current member squires receive a wallet card and deed certificate proclaiming them as owner of an unrecorded plot of land at the distillery and an honorary citizen of moore county tennessee production processedit making charcoal at the distillery ca – the mash for jack daniels is made from corn rye and malted barley and is distilled in copper stills it is then filtered through foot  m stacks of sugar maple charcoal the company refers to this filtering step as mellowing this extra step known as the lincoln county process removes impurities and the taste of corn the company argues this extra step makes the product different from bourbon however tennessee whiskey is required to be a straight bourbon whiskey under terms of the north american free trade agreement and canadian law a distinctive aspect of the filtering process is that the jack daniels brand grinds its charcoal before using it for filtering after the filtering the whiskey is stored in newly handcrafted oak barrels which give the whiskey its color and most of its flavor the product label mentions that it is a sour mash whiskey which means that when the mash is prepared some of the wet solids from a previously used batch are mixed in to help make the fermentation process operate more consistently this is common practice in american whiskey production as of update all currently produced straight bourbon is produced using the sour mash process after being used for the aging of jack daniels whiskey many barrels go to scotland to be used in the production of scotch whisky some barrels are leased from glenmorangie distillery some of the barrels are sold to mcilhenny company of avery island louisiana for production of tabasco sauce and to both the mount gay rum company of barbados and appleton estate of jamaica for use in the aging process of their distinctively flavored rumscitation needed some barrels are also cut in half and shipped to lowes home centers to be used as planter pots they

on a state level tennessee has imposed stringent requirements to be labeled as tennessee whiskey it is not enough under state law that the whiskey be produced in tennessee it must meet quality and production standards these are the same standards used by jack daniels distillery and some other distillers are displeased with the requirements being enshrined into law on may   tennessee governor bill haslam signed house bill  requiring the lincoln county process to be used for products produced in the state labeling themselves as tennessee whiskey with a particular exception tailored to exempt benjamin prichards and including the existing requirements for bourbon as federal law requires statements of origin on labels to be accurate the tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to tennessee whiskey requiring tennessee origin maple charcoal filtering by the lincoln county process prior to aging and the basic requirements of bourbon at least  corn new oak barrels charring of the barrels and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation aging and bottling in  legislation was introduced in the tennessee legislature that would modify the  law to allow the reuse of oak barrels in the tennessee whiskey aging process jack daniels master distiller jeff arnett vehemently opposed the legislation arguing the reuse of barrels would require the use of artificial colorings and flavorings and would render tennessee whiskey an inferior product to scotches and bourbons the company also has been the subject of a proposal to locally surtax its productwhen it is claimed that the distillery which is the main employer in a company town has capitalized on the bucolic image of lynchburg tennessee and it ought to pay a tax of  per barrel the company responded that such a tax is a confiscatory imposition penalizing it for the success of the enterprise the proposed tax faced a vote by the metro lynchburgmoore county council and was defeated

his exact birth date is unknown the company website says it is customary to celebrate his birthday in september the tennessee state library website said in  that records list his birth date as september   and that the  birth date seems impossible since his mother died in  in the  biography blood  whiskey the life and times of jack daniel author peter krass said his investigation showed that daniel was born in january  based on jacks sisters diary census records and the date of death of jacks mother jack was one of  children fathered by calaway daniel and was the youngest of his mothers  children after daniels mother lucinda cook daniel died his father remarried and had several more children jack daniels grandfather joseph job daniel emigrated from wales along with his scottish wife elizabeth calaway to the united states he was of welsh scottish english and scotsirish descent daniels father died in the civil war and he despised his stepmother and as a result he ran away from home and was essentially orphaned at a young age statue of jack daniel in front of the subterranean fresh water spring from whence he once drew the water for producing his whiskey jack daniels distillery lynchburg tennessee as a teenager daniel was taken in by a local lay preacher and moonshine distiller named dan call and began learning the distilling trade from call and his master distiller nearest green an enslaved african american man who continued to work with him after emancipation in  on receiving an inheritance from his fathers estate following a long dispute with his siblings daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with call he took over the distillery shortly afterward when call quit for religious reasons the brand label on the product says est  reg in  but his biographer has cited official registration documents to assert that the business was not established until  after taking over the distillery in  daniel purchased the hollow and land where the distillery is now located by the s jack daniels was one of  distilleries operating in moore county and the secondmost productive behind tom eatons distillery he began using squareshaped bottles in  with the square shape of the bottle intended to convey a sense of fairness and integrity according to daniels biographer the origin of the old no  brand name was the number assigned to daniels distillery for government registration he was forced to change the registration number when the federal government redrew the district and he became number  in district  instead of no  in district  however he continued to use his original number as a brand name since his brand reputation already had been established jack daniels experienced a surge in popularity after the whiskey received the gold medal for the finest whiskey at the  st louis worlds fair although his local reputation was suffering as the temperance movement was gaining strength jack daniel never married and did not have any children however he took his nephews under his wing – one of whom was lemuel lem motlow – lem a son of daniels sister finetta was skilled with numbers and was soon doing all of the distillerys bookkeeping in  due to failing health jack daniel gave the distillery to two of his nephews motlow soon bought out the other nephew and went on to operate the distillery for about  years ad for old no  from a may  issue of the nashville globe tennessee passed a statewide prohibition law in  effectively barring the legal distillation of jack daniels within the state motlow challenged the law in a test case that eventually worked its way to the tennessee supreme court the court upheld the law as constitutional however daniel died in  from blood poisoning an ofttold tale is that the infection began in one of his toes which daniel injured one early morning at work by kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open he was said to always have had trouble remembering the combination however daniels modern biographer has asserted that the story is not true because of the prohibition in tennessee the company began distilling operations in st louis missouri and birmingham alabama though none of the production from these locations was ever sold due to quality problems the alabama operation was halted following a similar statewide prohibition law in that state and the st louis operation was halted by the onset of nationwide prohibition following passage of the eighteenth amendment in  while the passage of the twentyfirst amendment in  repealed prohibition at the federal level state prohibition laws including tennessees remained in effect thus preventing the lynchburg distillery from reopening motlow who had become a tennessee state senator led efforts to repeal these laws allowing production to restart in  the fiveyear gap between national repeal and tennessee repeal was commemorated in  with a gift pack of two bottles one for the th anniversary of the end of prohibition and a second commemorating the th anniversary of the reopening of the distillery the replica home of lem motlow proprietor of jack daniels from  to  the original home was demolished in  and rebuilt to the likeness of lem motlows house at jack daniels distillery in lynchburg the jack daniels distillery ceased operations from  to  when the us government banned the manufacture of whiskey due to world war ii motlow resumed production of jack daniels in  after goodquality corn was again available motlow died the same year he bequeathed the distillery to his children robert reagor dan conner and mary upon his death the company was later incorporated as jack daniel distillery lem motlow prop inc this has allowed the company to continue to include lem motlow who died in  in its marketing since mentioning him in the advertising is technically just citing the full corporate name likewise the advertisements continue to use lynchburgs sera population figure of  though the

historyedit lowering to  proofedit until  jack daniels black label was historically produced at  us proof  alcohol by volume the lowerend green label product was  proof however starting in  the other label variations also were reduced in proof this began with black label being initially reduced to  proof both the black and green label expressions are made from the same ingredients the difference is determined by professional tasters who decide which of the batches would be sold under the premium black label with the rest being sold as standard green label a further dilution began in  when all generally available jack daniels products were reduced to  proof including the black label which had been  proof since  and was  proof before that thus further lowering production costs and excise taxes this reduction in alcohol content which was done without any announcement publicity or change of logo or packaging was noticed and condemned by modern drunkard magazine and the magazine formed a petition drive for drinkers who disagreed with the change the company countered that they believed consumers preferred lowerproof products and said that the change had not hurt the sales of the brand the petition effort garnered some publicity and collected more than  signatures but the company held firm with its decision a few years later advertising age said in  that virtually no one noticed the change and confirmed that sales of the brand had actually increased since the dilution began though it does not suppose any causes for that increase jack daniels has also produced higherproof special

current member squires receive a wallet card and deed certificate proclaiming them as owner of an unrecorded plot of land at the distillery and an honorary citizen of moore county tennessee production processedit making charcoal at the distillery ca – the mash for jack daniels is made from corn rye and malted barley and is distilled in copper stills it is then filtered through foot  m stacks of sugar maple charcoal the company refers to this filtering step as mellowing this extra step known as the lincoln county process removes impurities and the taste of corn the company argues this extra step makes the product different from bourbon however tennessee whiskey is required to be a straight bourbon whiskey under terms of the north american free trade agreement and canadian law a distinctive aspect of the filtering process is that the jack daniels brand grinds its charcoal before using it for filtering after the filtering the whiskey is stored in newly handcrafted oak barrels which give the whiskey its color and most of its flavor the product label mentions that it is a sour mash whiskey which means that when the mash is prepared some of the wet solids from a previously used batch are mixed in to help make the fermentation process operate more consistently this is common practice in american whiskey production as of update all currently produced straight bourbon is produced using the sour mash process after being used for the aging of jack daniels whiskey many barrels go to scotland to be used in the production of scotch whisky some barrels are leased from glenmorangie distillery some of the barrels are sold to mcilhenny company of avery island louisiana for production of tabasco sauce and to both the mount gay rum company of barbados and appleton estate of jamaica for use in the aging process of their distinctively flavored rumscitation needed some barrels are also cut in half and shipped to lowes home centers to be used as planter pots they

on a state level tennessee has imposed stringent requirements to be labeled as tennessee whiskey it is not enough under state law that the whiskey be produced in tennessee it must meet quality and production standards these are the same standards used by jack daniels distillery and some other distillers are displeased with the requirements being enshrined into law on may   tennessee governor bill haslam signed house bill  requiring the lincoln county process to be used for products produced in the state labeling themselves as tennessee whiskey with a particular exception tailored to exempt benjamin prichards and including the existing requirements for bourbon as federal law requires statements of origin on labels to be accurate the tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to tennessee whiskey requiring tennessee origin maple charcoal filtering by the lincoln county process prior to aging and the basic requirements of bourbon at least  corn new oak barrels charring of the barrels and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation aging and bottling in  legislation was introduced in the tennessee legislature that would modify the  law to allow the reuse of oak barrels in the tennessee whiskey aging process jack daniels master distiller jeff arnett vehemently opposed the legislation arguing the reuse of barrels would require the use of artificial colorings and flavorings and would render tennessee whiskey an inferior product to scotches and bourbons the company also has been the subject of a proposal to locally surtax its productwhen it is claimed that the distillery which is the main employer in a company town has capitalized on the bucolic image of lynchburg tennessee and it ought to pay a tax of  per barrel the company responded that such a tax is a confiscatory imposition penalizing it for the success of the enterprise the proposed tax faced a vote by the metro lynchburgmoore county council and was defeated

his exact birth date is unknown the company website says it is customary to celebrate his birthday in september the tennessee state library website said in  that records list his birth date as september   and that the  birth date seems impossible since his mother died in  in the  biography blood  whiskey the life and times of jack daniel author peter krass said his investigation showed that daniel was born in january  based on jacks sisters diary census records and the date of death of jacks mother jack was one of  children fathered by calaway daniel and was the youngest of his mothers  children after daniels mother lucinda cook daniel died his father remarried and had several more children jack daniels grandfather joseph job daniel emigrated from wales along with his scottish wife elizabeth calaway to the united states he was of welsh scottish english and scotsirish descent daniels father died in the civil war and he despised his stepmother and as a result he ran away from home and was essentially orphaned at a young age statue of jack daniel in front of the subterranean fresh water spring from whence he once drew the water for producing his whiskey jack daniels distillery lynchburg tennessee as a teenager daniel was taken in by a local lay preacher and moonshine distiller named dan call and began learning the distilling trade from call and his master distiller nearest green an enslaved african american man who continued to work with him after emancipation in  on receiving an inheritance from his fathers estate following a long dispute with his siblings daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with call he took over the distillery shortly afterward when call quit for religious reasons the brand label on the product says est  reg in  but his biographer has cited official registration documents to assert that the business was not established until  after taking over the distillery in  daniel purchased the hollow and land where the distillery is now located by the s jack daniels was one of  distilleries operating in moore county and the secondmost productive behind tom eatons distillery he began using squareshaped bottles in  with the square shape of the bottle intended to convey a sense of fairness and integrity according to daniels biographer the origin of the old no  brand name was the number assigned to daniels distillery for government registration he was forced to change the registration number when the federal government redrew the district and he became number  in district  instead of no  in district  however he continued to use his original number as a brand name since his brand reputation already had been established jack daniels experienced a surge in popularity after the whiskey received the gold medal for the finest whiskey at the  st louis worlds fair although his local reputation was suffering as the temperance movement was gaining strength jack daniel never married and did not have any children however he took his nephews under his wing – one of whom was lemuel lem motlow – lem a son of daniels sister finetta was skilled with numbers and was soon doing all of the distillerys bookkeeping in  due to failing health jack daniel gave the distillery to two of his nephews motlow soon bought out the other nephew and went on to operate the distillery for about  years ad for old no  from a may  issue of the nashville globe tennessee passed a statewide prohibition law in  effectively barring the legal distillation of jack daniels within the state motlow challenged the law in a test case that eventually worked its way to the tennessee supreme court the court upheld the law as constitutional however daniel died in  from blood poisoning an ofttold tale is that the infection began in one of his toes which daniel injured one early morning at work by kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open he was said to always have had trouble remembering the combination however daniels modern biographer has asserted that the story is not true because of the prohibition in tennessee the company began distilling operations in st louis missouri and birmingham alabama though none of the production from these locations was ever sold due to quality problems the alabama operation was halted following a similar statewide prohibition law in that state and the st louis operation was halted by the onset of nationwide prohibition following passage of the eighteenth amendment in  while the passage of the twentyfirst amendment in  repealed prohibition at the federal level state prohibition laws including tennessees remained in effect thus preventing the lynchburg distillery from reopening motlow who had become a tennessee state senator led efforts to repeal these laws allowing production to restart in  the fiveyear gap between national repeal and tennessee repeal was commemorated in  with a gift pack of two bottles one for the th anniversary of the end of prohibition and a second commemorating the th anniversary of the reopening of the distillery the replica home of lem motlow proprietor of jack daniels from  to  the original home was demolished in  and rebuilt to the likeness of lem motlows house at jack daniels distillery in lynchburg the jack daniels distillery ceased operations from  to  when the us government banned the manufacture of whiskey due to world war ii motlow resumed production of jack daniels in  after goodquality corn was again available motlow died the same year he bequeathed the distillery to his children robert reagor dan conner and mary upon his death the company was later incorporated as jack daniel distillery lem motlow prop inc this has allowed the company to continue to include lem motlow who died in  in its marketing since mentioning him in the advertising is technically just citing the full corporate name likewise the advertisements continue to use lynchburgs sera population figure of  though the

historyedit lowering to  proofedit until  jack daniels black label was historically produced at  us proof  alcohol by volume the lowerend green label product was  proof however starting in  the other label variations also were reduced in proof this began with black label being initially reduced to  proof both the black and green label expressions are made from the same ingredients the difference is determined by professional tasters who decide which of the batches would be sold under the premium black label with the rest being sold as standard green label a further dilution began in  when all generally available jack daniels products were reduced to  proof including the black label which had been  proof since  and was  proof before that thus further lowering production costs and excise taxes this reduction in alcohol content which was done without any announcement publicity or change of logo or packaging was noticed and condemned by modern drunkard magazine and the magazine formed a petition drive for drinkers who disagreed with the change the company countered that they believed consumers preferred lowerproof products and said that the change had not hurt the sales of the brand the petition effort garnered some publicity and collected more than  signatures but the company held firm with its decision a few years later advertising age said in  that virtually no one noticed the change and confirmed that sales of the brand had actually increased since the dilution began though it does not suppose any causes for that increase jack daniels has also produced higherproof special releases and premiumbrand expressions at times a onetime limited run of  proof the highest proof jack daniels had ever bottled at that time was bottled for the  tennessee bicentennial in a decorative

current member squires receive a wallet card and deed certificate proclaiming them as owner of an unrecorded plot of land at the distillery and an honorary citizen of moore county tennessee production processedit making charcoal at the distillery ca – the mash for jack daniels is made from corn rye and malted barley and is distilled in copper stills it is then filtered through foot  m stacks of sugar maple charcoal the company refers to this filtering step as mellowing this extra step known as the lincoln county process removes impurities and the taste of corn the company argues this extra step makes the product different from bourbon however tennessee whiskey is required to be a straight bourbon whiskey under terms of the north american free trade agreement and canadian law a distinctive aspect of the filtering process is that the jack daniels brand grinds its charcoal before using it for filtering after the filtering the whiskey is stored in newly handcrafted oak barrels which give the whiskey its color and most of its flavor the product label mentions that it is a sour mash whiskey which means that when the mash is prepared some of the wet solids from a previously used batch are mixed in to help make the fermentation process operate more consistently this is common practice in american whiskey production as of update all currently produced straight bourbon is produced using the sour mash process after being used for the aging of jack daniels whiskey many barrels go to scotland to be used in the production of scotch whisky some barrels are leased from glenmorangie distillery some of the barrels are sold to mcilhenny company of avery island louisiana for production of tabasco sauce and to both the mount gay rum company of barbados and appleton estate of jamaica for use in the aging process of their distinctively flavored rumscitation needed some barrels are also cut in half and shipped to lowes home centers to be used as planter pots they retain the whiskey smell for some time after arriving there and must be watered every couple of days to keep them intactclarification needed before they are sold and filled with soil legal statusedit on a state level tennessee has imposed stringent requirements to be labeled as tennessee whiskey it is not enough under state law that the whiskey be produced in tennessee it must meet quality and production standards these are the same standards used by jack daniels distillery and some other distillers are displeased with the requirements being enshrined into law on may   tennessee governor bill haslam signed house bill  requiring the lincoln county process to be used for products produced in the state labeling themselves as tennessee whiskey with a particular exception tailored to exempt benjamin prichards and including the existing requirements for bourbon as federal law requires statements of origin on labels to be accurate the tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to tennessee whiskey requiring tennessee origin maple charcoal filtering by the lincoln county process prior to aging and the basic requirements of bourbon at least  corn new oak barrels charring of the barrels and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation aging and bottling in  legislation was introduced in the tennessee legislature that would modify the  law to allow the reuse of oak barrels in the tennessee whiskey aging process jack daniels master distiller jeff arnett vehemently opposed the legislation arguing the reuse of barrels would require the use of artificial colorings and flavorings and would render tennessee whiskey an inferior product to scotches and bourbons the company also has been the subject of a proposal to locally surtax its productwhen it is claimed that the distillery which is the main employer in a company town has capitalized on the bucolic image of lynchburg tennessee and it ought to pay a tax of  per barrel the company responded that such a tax is a confiscatory imposition penalizing it for the success of the enterprise the proposed tax faced a vote by the metro lynchburgmoore county council and was defeated

daniel was born in january  based on jacks sisters diary census records and the date of death of jacks mother jack was one of  children fathered by calaway daniel and was the youngest of his mothers  children after daniels mother lucinda cook daniel died his father remarried and had several more children jack daniels grandfather joseph job daniel emigrated from wales along with his scottish wife elizabeth calaway to the united states he was of welsh scottish english and scotsirish descent daniels father died in the civil war and he despised his stepmother and as a result he ran away from home and was essentially orphaned at a young age statue of jack daniel in front of the subterranean fresh water spring from whence he once drew the water for producing his whiskey jack daniels distillery lynchburg tennessee as a teenager daniel was taken in by a local lay preacher and moonshine distiller named dan call and began learning the distilling trade from call and his master distiller nearest green an enslaved african american man who continued to work with him after emancipation in  on receiving an inheritance from his fathers estate following a long dispute with his siblings daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with call he took over the distillery shortly afterward when call quit for religious reasons the brand label on the product says est  reg in  but his biographer has cited official registration documents to assert that the business was not established until  after taking over the distillery in  daniel purchased the hollow and land where the distillery is now located by the s jack daniels was one of  distilleries operating in moore county and the secondmost productive behind tom eatons distillery he began using squareshaped bottles in  with the square shape of the bottle intended to convey a sense of fairness and integrity according to daniels biographer the origin of the old no  brand name was the number assigned to daniels distillery for government registration he was forced to change the registration number when the federal government redrew the district and he became number  in district  instead of no  in district  however he continued to use his original number as a brand name since his brand reputation already had been established jack daniels experienced a surge in popularity after the whiskey received the gold medal for the finest whiskey at the  st louis worlds fair although his local reputation was suffering as the temperance movement was gaining strength jack daniel never married and did not have any children however he took his nephews under his wing – one of whom was lemuel lem motlow – lem a son of daniels sister finetta was skilled with numbers and was soon doing all of the distillerys bookkeeping in  due to failing health jack daniel gave the distillery to two of his nephews motlow soon bought out the other nephew and went on to operate the distillery for about  years ad for old no  from a may  issue of the nashville globe tennessee passed a statewide prohibition law in  effectively barring the legal distillation of jack daniels within the state motlow challenged the law in a test case that eventually worked its way to the tennessee supreme court the court upheld the law as constitutional however daniel died in  from blood poisoning an ofttold tale is that the infection began in one of his toes which daniel injured one early morning at work by kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open he was said to always have had trouble remembering the combination however daniels modern biographer has asserted that the story is not true because of the prohibition in tennessee the company began distilling operations in st louis missouri and birmingham alabama though none of the production from these locations was ever sold due to quality problems the alabama operation was halted following a similar statewide prohibition law in that state and the st louis operation was halted by the onset of nationwide prohibition following passage of the eighteenth amendment in  while the passage of the twentyfirst amendment in  repealed prohibition at the federal level state prohibition laws including tennessees remained in effect thus preventing the lynchburg distillery from reopening motlow who had become a tennessee state senator led efforts to repeal these laws allowing production to restart in  the fiveyear gap between national repeal and tennessee repeal was commemorated in  with a gift pack of two bottles one for the th anniversary of the end of prohibition and a second commemorating the th anniversary of the reopening of the distillery the replica home of lem motlow proprietor of jack daniels from  to  the original home was demolished in

whiskey due to world war ii motlow resumed production of jack daniels in  after goodquality corn was again available motlow died the same year he bequeathed the distillery to his children robert reagor dan conner and mary upon his death the company was later incorporated as jack daniel distillery lem motlow prop inc this has allowed the company to continue to include lem motlow who died in

generally available jack daniels products were reduced to  proof including the black label which had been  proof since  and was  proof before that thus further lowering production costs and excise taxes this reduction in alcohol content which was done without any announcement publicity or change of logo or packaging was noticed and condemned by modern drunkard magazine and the magazine formed a petition drive for drinkers who disagreed with the change the company countered that they believed consumers preferred lowerproof products and said that the change had not hurt the sales of the brand the petition effort garnered some publicity and collected more than  signatures but the company held firm with its decision a few years later advertising age said in  that virtually no one noticed the change and confirmed that sales of the brand had actually increased since the dilution began though it does not suppose any causes for that increase jack daniels has also produced higherproof special

processedit making charcoal at the distillery ca – the mash for jack daniels is made from corn rye and malted barley and is distilled in copper stills it is then filtered through foot  m stacks of sugar maple charcoal the company refers to this filtering step as mellowing this extra step known as the lincoln county process removes impurities and the taste of corn the company argues this extra step makes the product different from bourbon however tennessee whiskey is required to be a straight bourbon whiskey under terms of the north american free trade agreement and canadian law a distinctive aspect of the filtering process is that the jack daniels brand grinds its charcoal before using it for filtering after the filtering the whiskey is stored in newly handcrafted oak barrels which give the whiskey its color and most of its flavor the product label mentions that it is a sour mash whiskey which means that when the mash is prepared some of the wet solids from a previously used batch are mixed in to help make the fermentation process operate more consistently this is common practice in american whiskey production as of update all currently produced straight bourbon is produced using the sour mash process after being used for the aging of jack daniels whiskey many barrels go to scotland to be used in the production of scotch whisky some barrels are leased from glenmorangie distillery some of the barrels are sold to mcilhenny company of avery island louisiana for production of tabasco sauce and to both the mount gay rum company of barbados and appleton estate of jamaica for use in the aging process of their distinctively flavored rumscitation needed some barrels are also cut in half and shipped to lowes home centers to be used as planter pots they retain the whiskey smell for some time after arriving there and must be watered every couple of days to keep them intactclarification needed before they are sold and filled with soil legal statusedit on a state level tennessee has imposed stringent requirements to be labeled as tennessee whiskey it is not enough under state law that the whiskey be produced in tennessee it must meet quality and production standards these are the same standards used by jack daniels distillery and some other distillers are displeased with the requirements being enshrined into law on may   tennessee governor bill haslam signed house bill  requiring the lincoln county process to be used for products produced in the state labeling themselves as tennessee whiskey with a particular exception tailored to exempt benjamin prichards and including the existing requirements for bourbon as federal law requires statements of origin on labels to be accurate the tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to tennessee whiskey requiring tennessee origin maple charcoal filtering by the lincoln county process prior to aging and the basic requirements of bourbon at least  corn new oak barrels charring of the barrels and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation aging and bottling in  legislation was introduced in the tennessee legislature that would modify the  law to allow the reuse of oak barrels in the tennessee whiskey aging process jack daniels master distiller jeff arnett vehemently opposed the legislation arguing the reuse of barrels would require the use of artificial colorings and flavorings and would render tennessee whiskey an inferior product to scotches and bourbons the company also has been the subject of a proposal to locally surtax its productwhen it is claimed that the distillery which is the main employer in a company town has capitalized on the bucolic image of lynchburg tennessee and it ought to pay a tax of  per barrel the company responded that such a tax is a confiscatory imposition penalizing it for the success of the enterprise the proposed tax faced a vote by the metro lynchburgmoore county council and was defeated

september   and that the  birth date seems impossible since his mother died in  in the  biography blood  whiskey the life and times of jack daniel author peter krass said his investigation showed that daniel was born in january  based on jacks sisters diary census records and the date of death of jacks mother jack was one of  children fathered by calaway daniel and was the youngest of his mothers  children after daniels mother lucinda cook daniel died his father remarried and had several more children jack daniels grandfather joseph job daniel emigrated from wales along with his scottish wife elizabeth calaway to the united states he was of welsh scottish english and scotsirish descent daniels father died in the civil war and he despised his stepmother and as a result he ran away from home and was essentially orphaned at a young age statue of jack daniel in front of the subterranean fresh water spring from whence he once drew the water for producing his whiskey jack daniels distillery lynchburg tennessee as a teenager daniel was taken in by a local lay preacher and moonshine distiller named dan call and began learning the distilling trade from call and his master distiller nearest green an enslaved african american man who continued to work with him after emancipation in  on receiving an inheritance from his fathers estate following a long dispute with his siblings daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with call he took over the distillery shortly afterward when call quit for religious reasons the brand label on the product says est  reg in  but his biographer has cited official registration documents to assert that the business was not established until  after taking over the distillery in  daniel purchased the hollow and land where the distillery is now located by the s jack daniels was one of  distilleries operating in moore county and the secondmost productive behind tom eatons distillery he began using squareshaped bottles in  with the square shape of the bottle intended to convey a sense of fairness and integrity according to daniels biographer the origin of the old no  brand name was the number assigned to daniels distillery for government registration he was forced to change the registration number when the federal government redrew the district and he became number  in district  instead of no  in district  however he continued to use his original number as a brand name since his brand reputation already had been established jack daniels experienced a surge in popularity after the whiskey received the gold medal for the finest whiskey at the  st louis worlds fair although his local reputation was suffering as the temperance movement was gaining strength jack daniel never married and did not have any children however he took his nephews under his wing – one of whom was lemuel lem motlow – lem a son of daniels sister finetta was skilled with numbers and was soon doing all of the distillerys bookkeeping in  due to failing health jack daniel gave the distillery to two of his nephews motlow soon bought out the other nephew and went on to operate the distillery for about  years ad for old no  from a may  issue of the nashville globe tennessee passed a statewide prohibition law in  effectively barring the legal distillation of jack daniels within the state motlow challenged the law in a test case that eventually worked its way to the tennessee supreme court the court upheld the law as constitutional however daniel died in  from blood poisoning an ofttold tale is that the infection began in one of his toes which daniel injured one early morning at work by kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open he was said to always have had trouble remembering the combination however daniels modern biographer has asserted that the story is not true because of the prohibition in tennessee the company began distilling operations in st louis missouri and birmingham alabama though none of the production from these locations was ever sold due to quality problems the alabama operation was halted following a similar statewide prohibition law in that state and the st louis operation was halted by the onset of nationwide prohibition following passage of the eighteenth amendment in  while the passage of the twentyfirst amendment in  repealed prohibition at the federal

historyedit lowering to  proofedit until  jack daniels black label was historically produced at  us proof  alcohol by volume the lowerend green label product was  proof however starting in  the other label variations also were reduced in proof this began with black label being initially reduced to  proof both the black and green label expressions are made from the same ingredients the difference is determined by professional tasters who decide which of the batches would be sold under the premium black label with the rest being sold as standard green label a further dilution began in  when all generally available jack daniels products were reduced to  proof including the black label which had been  proof since  and was  proof before that thus further lowering production costs and excise taxes this reduction in alcohol content which was done without any announcement publicity or change of logo or packaging was noticed and condemned by modern drunkard magazine and the magazine formed a petition drive for drinkers who disagreed with the change the company countered that they believed consumers preferred lowerproof products and said that the change had not hurt the sales of the brand the petition effort garnered some publicity and collected more than  signatures but the company held firm with its decision a few years later advertising age said in  that virtually no one noticed the change and confirmed that sales of the brand had actually increased since the dilution began though it does not suppose any causes for that increase jack daniels has also produced higherproof special

current member squires receive a wallet card and deed certificate proclaiming them as owner of an unrecorded plot of land at the distillery and an honorary citizen of moore county tennessee production processedit making charcoal at the distillery ca – the mash for jack daniels is made from corn rye and malted barley and is distilled in copper stills it is then filtered through foot  m stacks of sugar maple charcoal the company refers to this filtering step as mellowing this extra step known as the lincoln county process removes impurities and the taste of corn the company argues this extra step makes the product different from bourbon however tennessee whiskey is required to be a straight bourbon whiskey under terms of the north american free trade agreement and canadian law a distinctive aspect of the filtering process is that the jack daniels brand grinds its charcoal before using it for filtering after the filtering the whiskey is stored in newly handcrafted oak barrels which give the whiskey its color and most of its flavor the product label mentions that it is a sour mash whiskey which means that when the mash is prepared some of the wet solids from a previously used batch are mixed in to help make the fermentation process operate more consistently this is common practice in american whiskey production as of update all currently produced straight bourbon is produced using the sour mash process after being used for the aging of jack daniels whiskey many barrels go to scotland to be used in the production of scotch whisky some barrels are leased from glenmorangie distillery some of the barrels are sold to mcilhenny company of avery island louisiana for production of tabasco sauce and to both the mount gay rum company of barbados and appleton estate of jamaica for use in the aging process of their distinctively flavored rumscitation needed some barrels are also cut in half and shipped to lowes home centers to be used as planter pots they retain the whiskey smell for some time after arriving there and must be watered every couple of days to keep them intactclarification needed before they are sold and filled with soil legal statusedit on a state level tennessee has imposed stringent requirements to be labeled as tennessee whiskey it is not enough under state law that the whiskey be produced in tennessee it must meet quality and production standards these are the same standards used by jack daniels distillery and some other distillers are displeased with the requirements being enshrined into law on may   tennessee governor bill haslam signed house bill  requiring the lincoln county process to be used for products produced in the state labeling themselves as tennessee whiskey with a particular exception tailored to exempt benjamin prichards and including the existing requirements for bourbon as federal law requires statements of origin on labels to be accurate the tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to tennessee whiskey requiring tennessee origin maple charcoal filtering by the lincoln county process prior to aging and the basic requirements of bourbon at least  corn new oak barrels charring of the barrels and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation aging and bottling in  legislation was introduced in the tennessee legislature that would modify the  law to allow the reuse of oak barrels in the tennessee whiskey aging process jack daniels master distiller jeff arnett vehemently opposed the legislation arguing the reuse of barrels would require the use of artificial colorings and flavorings and would render tennessee whiskey an inferior product to scotches and bourbons the company also has been the subject of a proposal to locally surtax its productwhen it is claimed that the distillery which is the main employer in a company town has capitalized on the bucolic image of lynchburg tennessee and it ought to pay a tax of  per barrel the company responded that such a tax is a confiscatory imposition penalizing it for the success of the enterprise the proposed tax faced a vote by the metro lynchburgmoore county council and was defeated

house in lynchburg tennessee c jean brandau licensed to aboutcom miss mary bobos boarding house is one of the main attractions in lynchburg it doesnt take huntsville residents long to find out about the exceptional dining experience just  minutes north of town in lynchburg tennessee take a look at photos of miss mary bobos boarding housemany are more than willing to make bimonthly trips north to sit at the dining table of miss mary bobos boarding house and eat familystyle home cooking its hard to believe that the little town of lynchburg boasting of a county population of a little over  and home to jack daniels distillery can bring in busloads of tourists every daythe church group i went with signed up for miss bobos boarding house almost  months in advance i was on their waiting list and was told that it was a miracle that theyd had a cancellation and i would be going with themi counted myself lucky and boarded the bus with much anticipation id heard about miss bobos from different people in huntsville and now id be going to see and eat for myselfmiss mary bobos boarding house began in  when the young spinster assumed ownership of the historic salmon hotel it used to be a travelers hotel and was built over a springmiss bobo died in  just five weeks short of her nd birthday she remained sharpwitted and involved in the boarding house all her life she was confined to a wheelchair for just a few months before her deaththe boarding house is a beautiful white painted federalstyle building with giant maple trees in the front yard a spacious porch with swings and wooden chairs where guest can rest before or after their meal there are ferns and flowers to rival many gardens the noonday dinner is served at  am and  pm for  people at each sitting we were told by our tour guide to be there a half hour early or wed lose our placedinner is by reservation only a dinner bell is rung to let guests know when they can be seated there are several dining rooms on the main floor and two rooms in the basement where people can eatsince it was my first time i was encouraged to eat in the basement to experience the real atmosphere of miss bobos originally the dining room and kitchen were in the basementwe descended the wooden stairs to the basement with its brick floors and glimpse of the spring it had been built overone unique feature of miss bobos is the hostesses every table has a local lynchburg lady for their hostess ours was a tiny woman who didnt look like she ate two big meals a day this was one of those jobs that you only dream about having she said she only works two or three days a week and is careful to eat the main course with one group and dessert with the nexther duties include sharing local lynchburg history encouraging conversation among those at the long table we were from the same group so this wasnt hard and making sure that dishes are passed to the left and no one leaves the table hungry lunch includes generous helpings of two homestyled meats six vegetables and side dishes hot cornbread biscuits or rolls freshly brewed iced tea homemade dessert and a hot cup of coffeethere is always at least one item on the menu that contains the local hometown product in itgood old jack daniels whiskey the menu is varied every day except during the month of december when a holiday meal is served every daythe hostess told us that one item that is always on the menu is fried okrareservations can be made up to a year in advance our hostess informed us that it was best to make reservations just as soon as you know you want to come if they are full they are happy to take a waiting list and if youre driving by lynchburg at lunch time it wouldnt hurt to stop in and see if they had some last minute cancellations the day we were there they were able to accommodate two people on the spur of the momentthe day i was at miss bobos we enjoyed chicken casserole baked apples cooked with the local product in them a delicious squash casserole fried corn barbeque ribs pinto beans pasta cornbread chowchow tomatoes and onions and fried okra dessert was pumpkin chess square cake topped with cream cheese icing and crushed pecansour servers were scholarship students from one of the local universities our only complaint was that the plates were too small and our stomachs wouldnt hold enoughi have to admit the food was just as wonderful as everyone had promised it would be it was a feast and an adventure no wonder some people in huntsville make it a monthly or bimonthly routine in their travelsmiss bobos is now run

bottles of  napa valley silver oak wine and asked the server to please decanter them she got two wine decanters opened the bottles and poured them without filtering any possible settlement which there was we have never had this happen before and were surprised but did not say anything as it was too late we waited to let the wine breathe our food was served and our server still had not poured the wine we finally took it upon ourselves to pour and continued throughout the rest of the evening we have never had a problem like this before and feel someone needs to educate this server otherwise

bobos is a no no weird decor and weird music we got the impression this was once a good even great restaurant but those days are over the peculiar staff hung out at the bar all the time hostess sat the only two occupied tables smack next to each other and the waiters were dressed and acted like they were serving at the four seasons theyre known for their steaks which were ok but little too rare the sides were awful they came out so fast like they were straight out of the fridge and were micro waved but not thoroughly because they were cold the brussels sprouts were undercooked it was so

increasingly high and the drinks arent on par with the quality of the food its a very intimate atmosphere but since its a small place the tables are rather close together on every occasion we have had incredible steaks and sides but now that the prices have gone up it feels like we can get a similar meal somewhere more affordable we have enjoyed our time at bobos but we will be going elsewhere for
