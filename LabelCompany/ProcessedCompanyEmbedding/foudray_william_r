businesswilliam r foudray william r foudray vantage financial  second street suite  excelsior mn  wfoudrayvantagefnclcom according to the equipment leasing and financing association elfa over  of us businesses use leasing as a financing tool for acquiring equipment the most common items leased include computers vehicles machinery copiers and telecommunications equipment leasing benefits companies utilize leasing for a variety of reasons the primary reasons are as follows improved cash flow leasing often provides a lower monthly payment and requires no down payment because the lessor takes on a residual risk position the lease will have a lower payment during the term than a traditional term loan life cycle managementobsolescence for assets with limited useful lives such as computer equipment and copiers leasing provides companies with the ability to always use the most advanced equipment at a predictable cost as the equipment becomes obsolete the lessee has the ability to return it to the lessor and upgrade to the most current technology preserve bank lines companies often chose to lease to preserve availability under their traditional bank lines ease of use many leasing companies are set up to accommodate transactions of  and less on an application only basis this eliminates the need for companies to undergo a rigorous review of their financial statements valued added services leasing companies often provide additional services to their clients such as purchasing discounts on equipment tradein credits tax administration and online asset tracking tools financial covenant benefits lease accounting rules are defined under the statements of financial accounting standards number  fas  under these rules a company records neither the asset nor the liability when they enter into a true accounting operating lease for many companies operating leases help them comply with covenants in their bank agreements choosing the right lease product there are basically two types of leases a capital lease allows the lessee to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for  or another predetermined amount a capital lease is treated similarly to a loan on a company’s balance sheet a capital lease is normally the right solution for assets that have a long useful life such as furniture and leasehold improvements typically these are assets that the company plans to continue to use beyond the lease term an operating lease allows the lessee to return the equipment at the end of the lease term these leases are normally best for equipment that becomes obsolete quickly such as computers copiers and other technology assets choosing the right lessor choosing the right lessor is as important as choosing the right supplier of the equipment key attributes to consider are the lessor’s reputation relationship focus competitive pricing and clear terms and conditions in the lease leasing can be an effective method for you to acquire equipment to fuel your company’s growth leasing can help you save money improve your cash flow and manage your equipment more efficiently   intellectual capital connection home next »     fidelitybankmncom news
