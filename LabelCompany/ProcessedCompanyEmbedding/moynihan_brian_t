moynihan save bank of america bank of america’s slide into the unknown has rekindled memories of lehman brothers’ collapse can the nation’s largest bank survive intact by dawn kopecki dawnkopecki more stories by dawn kopecki september    pm edt on the afternoon of aug  gary g lynch the global chief of legal compliance and regulatory relations for bank of america was attending a meeting in washington when the floor heaved although lynch a lanky yearold attorney with sweptback white hair had never experienced an earthquake he possessed the good sense to get beneath a sturdy conference table along with several other people “if the ceiling came down” he recalls “i thought we were dead” the ceiling held despite the magnitude  quake rippling from its epicenter in virginia minutes later lynch pulled out his blackberry and discovered another startling development a rumor rattling wall street that bank of america might get swept into an involuntary governmentorchestrated rescue by its smaller rival jpmorgan chase “this is really getting nuts” he thought lynch who as the head of enforcement at the securities and exchange commission in the late s brought ivan boesky and michael milken to heel knew he’d come under heavy fire when he parachuted into bofa this july his assignment defend against a seemingly endless barrage of multibilliondollar lawsuits and government investigations concerning defective mortgagebacked bonds manufactured at the height of the real estate bubble no sooner did one liability bomb explode than it was followed by another now lynch was doing duckandcover for real while the bank’s share price was pounded to within a whisker of  down more than  percent since jan  the wild speculation about a forced merger combined ominously with financial analyst chatter that the mortgage onslaught would drain bofa’s capital requiring it to sell more stock in desperation would bank of america which just weeks earlier had reported a record secondquarter loss of  billion go the way of bear stearns or lehman brothers it was starting to smell like  hotshot bofa investment bankers gaped at  restricted stock units granted in  and early  which on paper had lost half of their value they began thumbing smartphones for contact info of potential alternative employers managers interrupted vacations to rush into the office and calm valuable dealmakers calm of a temporary sort returned two days later thanks to a theatrical buffettexmachina intervention three years ago bear was sold for scrap while lehman was allowed to collapse into bankruptcy setting off a global financial crisis and recession announced on aug  buffett’s purchase of  billion in bofa preferred stock—on typical onlyforwarren terms including a  million annual dividend—allowed the bank to edge back from the abyss much as buffett’s  billion vote of confidence arrested a run on goldman sachs stock in  on sept  only hours after he sat for an exclusive interview with bloomberg businessweek bofa chief executive officer brian t moynihan grabbed attention again by reshuffling his management ranks elevating a pair of new cochief operating officers and ousting sallie krawcheck the highprofile head of wealth management after all the excitement the bank’s shares were up  percent from their nadir for now bank of america will not go the way of lehman or bear it has  billion in cash and liquid investments and more important with  trillion in assets it exemplifies the sorry concept of “too big to fail” no matter what anyone says to the contrary the us government cannot afford to allow a financial institution of that size to go down and drag the rest of the country with it bofa’s difficulties are too complex however to be solved by buffett swashbuckling executive replacements or the retention of a really sharp lawyer america’s biggest bank is inextricably intertwined with a stilldebilitated us housing market and an unemployment rate stuck painfully above  percent “bank of america is the purest reflection of the united states economy of any of the largest financial institutions” observes john a kanas the chief executive officer of privately held bankunited bofa owns or services one in five home loans in the us operates more than  retail branches and serves  million customers “as america goes” says kanas “so will bank of america” then there’s countrywide financial the worst corporate acquisition in living memory bofa’s former ceo kenneth d lewis bought the california subprime cesspool in  its stench has permeated the charlottebased bank ever since rampant fretting over whether bofa has sufficient capital and needs to sell more stock traces primarily to fear that it can’t quantify its mounting writeoffs and losses connected to hundreds of thousands of mortgages gone bad so far the aggregate countrywide damage exceeds  billion “obviously there aren’t many days when i wake up and think positively about the countrywide acquisition” moynihan said on aug  during a conference call arranged to reassure anxious investors even some of his loyal aides concede that the call like a series of other pronouncements he has made this year didn’t comfort many uneasy money managers moynihan received his ceo stars in a battlefield promotion in december  after lewis was perceived as losing investor confidence a compact yearold former rugby player at brown university he has admirers who praise his herculean work ethic and intelligence charismatic he is not moynihan displays little if any humor in public and swallows many of his words his outofearshot nickname within the bank according to several employees is “the mumbler” asked for a selfevaluation during the aug  conference call he said “i think my performance with the management team in terms of transforming the company i think has been strong our performance on the share performance has not been strong” more serious than his bouts of verbal artlessness moynihan has overpromised on critical occasions most notably in predicting prematurely that he would raise the bank’s pennyashare dividend this year such mistakes have obscured his reasonable attempt to remake the bloated organization he inherited to his credit he is different from the generation of hubristic bankers typified by lewis  and former citigroup ceo sanford i weill  during a prolonged era of bipartisan antiregulatory ideology the lewisweill cohort built the behemoths that were too big to manage and ultimately too big for washington to allow to go under the instability of those institutions contributed to the panic of  and its messy unfinished cleanup moynihan who for six years toiled as lewis’s lieutenant seems determined to learn from his former boss’s mistakes the younger man came into his job planning to sell off extraneous assets acquired by lewis in the process he has made the bank a more focused institution that in the long run ought to be less dangerous to the financial system whether he has the dexterity to survive the current crisis and complete the task is an open question in the space of only a dozen years bank of america transformed itself from an unremarkable regional business into a financial supermarket of gargantuan proportions charlotte in turn grew into the country’s secondbiggest banking center after new york lewis who never concealed his southerner’s disdain for hifalutin wall street types capped an extraordinary acquisition spree in  first by absorbing countrywide a subprimemortgage factory on the verge of bankruptcy then with encouragement from the bush administration he took over merrill lynch the faltering brokerage and investment bank merrill turned out to be lewis’s undoing he lost his job in  when questions arose over whether he fully disclosed its precarious financial condition as he pushed bofa shareholders to approve the  billion deal moynihan had joined the ballooning bofa in  when lewis paid  billion for fleetboston financial itself the product of rapidfire mergers and acquisitions the fleet executive had a law degree from the university of notre dame but set his sights higher than the legal department many of his bostonbased former colleagues couldn’t—or chose not to—adjust to life under the notoriously demanding lewis moynihan adapted years later in his  book winning former general electric chief executive officer jack welch held him up as a model of corporate stamina “he showed exactly what you should show if you want to survive a merger—enthusiasm optimism and thoughtful support” at bank of america moynihan didn’t specialize like a leatherhelmeted footballer of yore he played offense and defense and in a pinch came in to punt to make absolutely sure he got no sleep he often commuted to bofa’s large new york outpost from boston where his family—wife susan berry an attorney and three young children—remained his dedication inspires awe in the office “flash or pizzazz isn’t what clients want” says purna saggurti bank of america’s chairman of global corporate and investment banking “clients want content and a trusted adviser” as lewis’s grip on his empire loosened in  moynihan lacking deep roots in charlotte or a proven ceo’s credential was a dark horse candidate to succeed him but the bank’s directors were feuding and other candidates fell away in december moynihan walked into a new york hotel room to meet with the board of directors’ search committee he held a single sheet of paper on which he had written a strategic vision that actually could have fit on a note card enough already with the acquisitions let’s get back to banking or words to that effect he got the job lewis hosted a large ceremony in charlotte to introduce the new ceo “many of you know him” the outgoing chief executive said of moynihan “because he’s been in so many different jobs and so hopefully he’ll be in this job much longer than the last three or four” the audience of bank of america employees many wearing the company’s redwhiteandblue flagscape lapel pin laughed standing to the side of the auditorium stage moynihan smiled tightly the backhanded compliments continued “another unique characteristic about him” lewis noted “is that he wanted the job” with that inauspicious endorsement moynihan took control of a vast assemblage of businesses which collectively had received federal cash injections totaling  billion and appeared to be on life support then with miraculous speed merrill began to recover the acquisition that brought down lewis became a surprise turnaround story federal bailout money was repaid in april  to everyone’s relief the rookie ceo announced a firstquarter profit of  billion on a less happy note countrywide a relative detail in  was metastasizing into a disaster when speaking privately bank of america executives will now acknowledge that countrywide behaved deplorably during the real estate frenzy in june  bofa agreed to pay  million to settle federal charges that countrywide overcharged mortgage customers the firm “profited from making risky loans to homeowners during the boom years and then profited again when the loans failed” the federal trade commission asserted as a formal matter bofa didn’t admit or deny the allegations saying instead that it agreed to the settlement “to avoid the expense and distraction associated with litigating the case” the expense and distraction were just beginning in the fall of  with consumer complaints about mortgage abuses increasing bofa temporarily halted foreclosures across the country moynihan said the bank was modifying countrywide mortgage terms to keep people in their houses— modifications a month by late  contrary to expectations though home prices continued to slump in many areas and overall economic growth remained weak despite the federal reserve’s policy of keeping interest rates essentially at zero new threats came into focus even as state and federal prosecutors revved up investigations of fraud in the issuing and servicing of loans by countrywide and its former competitors other antagonists filed complaints fannie mae and freddie mac the quasigovernmental housing finance companies argued that millions of mortgages they bought as part of their mission to spur homeownership were turning out to be rotten fannie and freddie wanted bank of america and other lenders to buy back billions in defective loans in addition there were unhappy institutional investors that had purchased mortgagebacked securities a type of bond assembled from bundles of home loans when broke borrowers stopped paying on the mortgages the bonds defaulted investors wanted compensation on oct   one bondholder group led by blackrock and pacific investment management pimco sent bofa a stern letter demanding the bank buy back mortgages packaged into  billion of bonds there was no reason to think the blackrock demand would be the last of its kind a day later bofa announced an  million thirdquarter  provision to resolve mortgage repurchase claims that compared with  billion in the second quarter and  million in the first moynihan tried to allay nervousness over a perpetually open spigot “it’s a half billion half billion half billion” he said during an investor conference call “those are the kinds of numbers that would be more recurring” in other words half a billion dollars per quarter may seem like a lot to ordinary folk but we can handle it not that bank of america would surrender those halfabillions without a fight “it’s daytoday handtohand combat” moynihan told an investor conference in new york in november  all the same he said in december the bank planned to increase its dividend as fast as possible—a signal that its capital levels were sound “i don’t see anything that would stop us” he added in january  he had yet more encouraging news the bank would take an additional  billion provision to settle claims from the governmentsponsored enterprises gses fannie and freddie “we are pleased to put the gses behind us this quarter” moynihan said on jan  he spoke too soon “brian while he is a very experienced executive is an inexperienced chief executive” notes bankunited ceo john kanas a moynihan fan “he has made a couple of political mistakes overpromising” on mar  bank of america admitted in a regulatory filing that the federal reserve had rejected its request for a dividend increase in the second half of  among the four largest us lenders a group rounded out by jpmorgan citigroup and wells fargo bofa was the only one that didn’t announce a higher dividend after the fed reviewed the companies’ financial health in march in an interview with bloomberg news jonathan hatcher a credit strategist at jefferies in new york called the fed action “a soft warning shot” across bank of america’s bow more warnings followed in april bofa announced a  billion deal with assured guaranty to resolve claims tied to tainted mortgagebacked securities the insurance company had covered outstanding mortgagebuyback demands climbed to  billion the bank said the same month then in may it conceded in a regulatory filing that the cost of privateinvestor demands might rise to between  billion and  billion or  billion more than the previously publicized range later in may moynihan said that the settlement with fannie mae might have sprung a leak as the larger gse stepped up its buyback demands “we still have some work to do” on resolving fannie mae demands moynihan conceded in june bofa said it agreed to pay  billion to settle claims by the blackrockpimco group of bondholders bank of america generates an enormous amount of revenue— billion in —so it can afford to settle a lot of liability claims “the problem” says william b smith the ceo of smith asset management a new york hedge fund “is the unknown” by midsummer it became apparent that no one including bank of america understood the ultimate damage attributable to countrywide smith asset management nevertheless owns bofa stock “for those of us who are bullish we don’t believe the mortgage hit is crippling” william b smith says “those who are bearish believe it is” like a number of other investors he takes solace from market analysis showing that bofa’s breakup value exceeds its current market value of about  billion “tear this thing apart after you get down the road a bit” says smith and the stock could triple in value that’s not what bank of america’s management or its  employees want to hear nor does the notion that bank of america might be worth more dismembered provide any consolation to hundreds of thousands of homeowners behind on their mortgage payments some of whom accuse bofa or its blacksheep subprimemortgage unit of mistreating them “they were greedy … it was a bad decision to acquire countrywide” says don barrett a plaintiffs’ lawyer in lexington miss who is representing allegedly defrauded borrowers “if bank of america is going to survive they’d better get closure they need closure with investors but they also need closure with the legitimate borrowers” brian moynihan’s private conference room on the th floor of the bank of america corporate center in downtown charlotte has the usual photo of its occupant with the incumbent president along with other ceo knickknacks moynihan has draped a canaryyellow tshirt where every visitor can see it “grind together shine together” the black lettering on the shirt instructs and moynihan presents himself as a grinditout kind of guy he recognizes that he sees one company while wall street lately sees another “we have the strongest capital we’ve ever had in the company for decades” he says “we have the strongest liquidity” he sounds frustrated the bank has  billion in what is known as tier one common equity which translates to a capital ratio of  percent under today’s rules that’s more than enough to meet current requirements and puts bofa well within shooting distance of tougher international standards that will be phased in over coming years moynihan says “litigation aside there’s nothing wrong with this company” says paul miller a former examiner for the federal reserve bank of philadelphia who is now an analyst at fbr capital markets in arlington va how will moynihan close the perception gap “we have to keep educating and pounding and pounding and pounding” he says “the no  thing for me was to make the company clearer more focused get away from the acquisition heritage of big is great as opposed to great is great” no question he’s slimmed the bank down he has sold off assets worth nearly  billion these include stakes in a bank in brazil  billion and one in mexico  billion a  billion investment in blackrock a  billion portion of an insurance company more modestly valued creditcard portfolios in the uk spain and canada and most recently half of bank of america’s stake in china construction bank which sold for  billion the lewisera binge left bofa with all kinds of pointless overhead “nobody sat down and said ‘we want  data centers’ we inherited  data centers” says moynihan he intends to get that down to the single digits he frames the sept  management shakeup as a streamlining maneuver where there had been no chief operating officer now there will be two promoted from within david c darnell will oversee businesses responsible for serving individual customers including deposits credit cards home mortgages and wealth management thomas k montag will supervise operations related to corporations and institutional investors “they are accountable now for delivering our entire franchise to all our customers and clients” moynihan said in a written announcement joe price who had been president of consumer and small business banking was ousted along with sallie krawcheck the former wealthmanagement chief moynihan is in no mood however to apologize he says he has no regrets about promising to raise the dividend and then not being able to follow through he waves off the criticism as missing the larger point that shareholders will benefit in the long run from a stronger better capitalized bank similarly he dismisses suggestions that he’s an ineffective public communicator his job is to make sure that every employee understands that at all times they should be serving one of the bank’s three customer groups individuals companies and institutional investors because he has pounded this home so consistently he adds “there’s  people could probably give that speech right now” or maybe fewer moynihan has announced  layoffs so far this year with more to come the ceo doesn’t utter the word “countrywide” voluntarily he won’t comment on one option—putting the unit into bankruptcy—and he refers to the mess in shorthand “we have to keep taking uncertain risks and eliminate them and that’s what we’ve been doing in the mortgage area” for countrywide details he recommends talking to gary lynch bank of america’s top inhouse lawyer works in a serene sanctum high above sixth avenue in new york the room features cool white marble and white leather lynch has made a career of remaining unruffled—at the sec during its s insidertrading investigations later as a partner at the new york corporate law firm davis polk  wardwell and then as the seniormost attorney at investment banks credit suisse first boston and morgan stanley it’s no wonder that moynihan hired lynch but is the attorney still glad he moved over to bank of america lynch laughs a public relations man holds his breath and the lawyer says yes with professorial precision he proceeds to sort the categories of legal risks facing bofa into three “buckets” over time he explains the bank can gradually empty each bucket first there are “representations and warranties” claims such as those made by the gses and the blackrockpimco bondholder group those parties want bofa to buy back mortgages allegedly based on false information about borrowers or property bank of america has negotiated compromise payments for most of the repsandwarranties claims bucket no  contains fraud lawsuits filed by investors who bought mortgagebacked securities which have lost value a lawsuit filed aug  by american international group the new yorkbased insurance giant sits in that bucket aig seeks damages of  billion lynch says the bank will fight the vast majority of such suits “i’d much rather be sued by aig than by someone who has never purported to be an expert on mortgages and risk management” he notes his point is that aig is a sophisticated financial player that should have known that subprimebacked bonds could explode finally there’s a bucket for government allegations that countrywide generated fraudulent foreclosure documents bofa and other large lenders are skirmishing with the  state attorneys general in hopes of reaching a mass settlement whose collective price tag has been estimated at  billion sweeping a long arm over his imaginary litigation receptacles lynch seems sure of himself statutes of limitation are running out and that’s why so many lawyers rushed to the courthouse this summer he says “we’re comfortable that these securitization cases will go away or be settled for cents on the dollar” he adds “at the end of the day do we have ample capital to get through this absolutely” “if someone is going to say ‘ok counselor tell me exactly what you’re going to pay out’ i can’t do that and i wouldn’t try” lynch acknowledges what’s more he says the mortgage litigation won’t get resolved in three months or six months or a year “past cases of this type have been working through the process for years” the problem from his clients’ perspective is that even when bank of america says it has something resolved new doubts clutter the bucket the state ags’ settlement seems in broad outline like a reasonable idea big lenders fork over cash to make borrowers whole and modify the terms on some mortgages so people can keep their homes but lately attorneys general in new york delaware and nevada have broken ranks saying they don’t want to rush to a truce because they’re not through investigating lenders’ misbehavior moreover the new york prosecutor eric t schneiderman has challenged the propriety of the  billion settlement with private bondholders casting uncertainty on that pact too for all the angst over bank of america on wall street and in the media regulators at the federal reserve and treasury dept speaking privately because they are not authorized to comment on particular banks say they have watched moynihan’s performance and are mostly pleased by what they’ve seen in fact they applaud his shrinking the company and similar moves by some of his competitors one of the paradoxes of the  crisis has been that in its aftermath a us financial industry overpopulated with institutions considered too big to fail became even more consolidated mergers such as bank of america’s acquisition of merrill and countrywide and jpmorgan’s absorption of bear stearns and washington mutual have produced a quartet of megabanks that together hold  trillion in assets or  percent of the us total compared with  percent of the total before the crisis even with this added consolidation and the potential risk it perpetuates in the event of a true investor or depositor run on any of the megabanks regulators say there has not been much for them to do about bank of america’s difficulties new oversight tools created by the doddfrank financial reform legislation enacted in  are still being crafted and industry lobbyists are still trying to blunt rules on how much capital banks must hold how they sell mortgages and what kind of trading they can do for their own accounts to avoid future taxpayer bailouts the law required major banks to submit “living wills” or plans for how they could be efficiently dismembered in dire circumstances but details on the livingwill process are still being debated no wills have been submitted to washington regulators say bank of america hasn’t gotten into livingwill territory because the bank has cash on hand and the ability to borrow more so far the doddfrank law’s perverse effect has been to heighten uncertainty without disentangling the combinations of investment banking with consumer and commercial banking that proved so perilous in the wake of the housing bubble one positive change is that there are more cops walking the banking beat about  examiners from the fed’s richmond va branch are assigned fulltime to monitoring bank of america up from  in  fed staff members say they are able to give closer scrutiny to the bank’s securities and loan portfolios as well as the risk associated with its assets and the adequacy of its capital in early summer when fed officials requested options bofa might consider if overall economic conditions seriously eroded the bank responded that one possibility would be to issue a separate class of shares linked to the performance of merrill lynch according to bofa moynihan does not think such a step will be needed and similarly has no plans to sell more bofa common stock his aides say while fed examiners are supposed to be keeping an eye out for reckless practices within bofa there’s a danger that other government officials and politicians could hasten a fresh financial meltdown as they seek their pound of assets from bank of america the stateag foreclosure probe has identified troubling past practices but the handful of prosecutors holding up a resolution could jeopardize the prize they desire likewise fannie mae and freddie mac two of bofa’s other main antagonists are each almost  percentowned by us taxpayers as a result of rescues at the depths of the financial crisis the gses are “we the people” if they help take bank of america down taxpayers will have to mop up on sept  the federal housing finance agency the washington regulator of fannie and freddie joined the fray in its own brace of lawsuits the fhfa accused bank of america and  other lenders of misleading fannie and freddie about billions of dollars of mortgagebacked securities the problem for moynihan says lou barnes “is that everyone is suing him he can’t know when the suits will stop and meanwhile—hello—the economy isn’t bouncing back and it’s damned tough to get a home loan approved out here” barnes a banker and credit analyst at premier mortgage group in boulder colo argues that moynihan “looks to be doing as well as any little dutch boy can—sticking his fingers in the dike” the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up but more cracks

continue reading the main story photo brian t moynihan chief of bank of america is increasingly coming under pressure to demonstrate his ability not only to lead bank of america the nation’s secondlargest bank but to expand it as well credit chris ratcliffebloomberg news via getty images just two weeks ago in a conference call with wall street analysts bruce thompson the chief financial officer of bank of america took a victory lapthe bank long troubled by expensive legal woes stemming from the mortgage crisis appeared to have finally turned a corner as its quarterly earnings soared bank of america’s balance sheet mr thompson crowed had “never been stronger” that week he played a round of golf with the chief executive brian t moynihan in charlotte nc where the bank is baseda few days later mr thompson was outmr thompson’s move seemed strangely abrupt but it had actually been in the works for some time banking regulators were told of his possible exit well in advance of last wednesday’s announcement people briefed on the matter saidstill the move stunned analysts and investors who wondered what was going on at the top of the bank mr thompson’s was the most prominent of a series of moves in the executive suites and that turnover had occurred at a time of tensions between the various parts of the bank former executives describe the relationships between mr moynihan and some members of his leadership team as “strained” advertisement continue reading the main story all this adds to the burden of mr moynihan who is increasingly coming under pressure to demonstrate his ability not only to lead the nation’s secondlargest bank— a complex organization with  trillion in assets clashing cultures geographic silos and various power battles within — but also to expand it continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story it’s a herculean task that he has struggled withsince mr moynihan was named chief executive in late  bank of america’s stock performance has lagged the nation’s socalled megabanks including jpmorgan chase citigroup and wells fargobank of america has taken more than  billion in charges — an amount nearly as big as the stock market value of us bancorp — to pay for the most part legal fines settlements and penalties largely related to its consumer mortgage business last year the bank faced an embarrassing  billion error in its books that caused regulators to delay a promised stockbuyback plan again on this year’s stress test bank of america received only conditional approval because of concerns about weakness in internal controls around capital planningwhile executives at other banks were able to bolster profits more easily by shedding businesses and slashing costs mr moynihan his defenders noted was stuck managing the enormous financial and legal fallout brought on by two transformational mergers undertaken by his predecessor kenneth d lewis the acquisitions of the mortgage lender countrywide and the investment banking giant merrill lynch in “i think moynihan has done a reasonably good job of dealing with the legacy issues but i don’t think he gets the same respect as some of his peers and my question is is he the right guy going forward” asked jonathan finger a partner at houstonbased finger interests which owns about  shares of bank of americamr moynihan’s critics inside and outside the bank say he has struggled to articulate a clear strategic path to growth the bank instead has relied too much they say on a potential increase in interest rates to bolster profitsat the same time there is no clear successor to mr moynihan inside the bank the most prominent — and possibly most powerful — top executive is the chief operating officer and head of the investment bank thomas k montag who is not considered a likely candidate for the job unless he is asked to step in during an emergencyin a phone interview from his offices in boston mr moynihan said he had managed to cut expenses bolster capital cushions and rebuild the brand of a company that had become the face of the nation’s foreclosure crisis and a punching bag for politicians seeking tougher regulation of wall street “no one took the amount of hits that we took” mr moynihan said “no one had a deeper hole to get out of” advertisement continue reading the main story a bank spokesman says it is more relevant to measure the company’s performance since  which is when mr moynihan’s strategy of simplifying the company and working through legal issues began to take hold over that threeyear period bank of america’s shares have far outshone competitors’ the recent lag in the share price the spokesman said is only natural after its previous runupbut by other measures bank of america is still climbing out of a hole despite some onetime items that helped bolster profits in the second quarter the bank’s revenue in certain key businesses has been declining faster than expenses a barrage of new regulations has curbed the ability of banks to generate profits in nearly everything they do — from trading bonds to issuing credit cardswhile many banks face a similar predicament bank of america’s trials are compounded by mr moynihan’s challenge of integrating a hodgepodge of businesses — and personalities — assembled largely in a time of crisismoreover they say mr moynihan  has surrounded himself with a closeknit circle of loyal lieutenants — many from his days at the regional bank fleetboston financial which was acquired by bank of america in at least five of the  members of mr moynihan’s executive management team including a cohead of consumer banking its leader of global wealth and investment management its corporate auditor and its head of global strategy have ties to fleetbostonamong these close allies insiders say there is no obvious heir apparent — though one name that gets mentioned is dean athanasia a cohead of consumer banking who is  years oldmr moynihan said “my guess is that whoever succeeds me is in their s today not someone in their s” advertisement continue reading the main story the departing cfo mr thompson  was widely seen as the person in line to fill mr moynihan’s shoes but his star dimmed people briefed on the matter said after the bank miscalculated its capital levels by  billion last yearmr moynihan was angry at mr thompson and his team for the mistake people briefed on the matter said he appointed a trusted former fleetboston colleague to take over the bank’s preparation for its stress test submissions a job that had been done by the cfomr moynihan brushes off any suggestions of strain among his leadership team attributing any tensions to the natural frictions at a bank that has undergone a sea change over the last six years“we were never an international bank and now we are one” mr moynihan said “we were not a major investment bank in global market activity and now we are one on the consumer side we had been a product company that relied too much on overdraft fees and i ended that there are all these cultures that needed to change”when he was first named chief executive mr moynihan seemed an unlikely choice to pull off that transformation photo thomas montag president of global banking and markets at bank of america is not considered a likely successor to his boss credit jonathan fickiesbloomberg news via getty images sometimes referred to as “the accidental ceo” mr moynihan was initially heading out the door as a result of the merrill lynch acquisition but he survived the merger and later when mr lewis was ousted

were staring at their bloomberg screens that showed their own holdings in the investment bank disintegrating in the fall of  yet mr montag managed to win over many of them“the guy can really rally up a room” a former trader saidwhile some said mr montag  harbored ambitions to lead bank of america others inside the bank said they did not believe he was ever a viable candidate for instance some said it had been difficult for him to contain his frustration with sweeping new banking regulations a reality for any bank chieftwo former highranking bank executives said relations between mr moynihan and mr montag who was named the bank’s sole chief operating officer last fall had been strainedinside the bank others dispute the idea that there are tensions between its top two leadersthey note that mr

foreclosuresfollowsign in  sign upthinkprogressblockedunblockfollowfollowingmoving news forwardoct  ignoring massive industry fraud bank of america ceo hypes benefits of faster foreclosuresby lee fangspeaking at the atlantic idea fest earlier this week bank of america ceo brian moynihan sat down for a televised interview with cnbc’s larry kudlow defending the bank’s new  per month debit card fee moynihan invented something he called the “right to make a profit”but another segment of the interview sheds a great deal of light on how bank of america sees its role in the economy a year ago bank of america was among the many banks caught in a sweeping “robosigning” scandal in which documents were allegedly fabricated in places all over the country in order to foreclose on more homes although bank of america has continued using robosigning tactics today moynihan and kudlow dismissed the potentially massive fraud and bantered about how faster foreclosures could be great for the countrykudlow isn’t it fair to say the faster the foreclosure the better off we’re going to be and i know there’s pain but of course some people lose other people win young families come in they’re going going to get very low prices but the point is the faster we clear our the unsold inventory the sooner this country might start creating jobs in a real economic growth situation is that fairmoynihan you can look at the markets and see where the markets have had the inventory cleared you’re seeing prices stabilizekudlow so these attorneys general around the country that were blocking you because there were a few bad robotypeletters or whatever they were robosigning letters they’re keeping the economy on its back because they won’t let the housing market adjust and they’re all over bank of america you’re like their favorite guywatchpraising the speed of foreclosures in california moynihan said the state has “faired reasonably well” considering the housing market his remarks might have been aimed at california attorney general kamala harris harris recently withdrew from the multistate settlement deal with the banks in part because of her concern with the big banks’ attempt to gain legal immunity for the robosigning fraudsharenever miss a story from thinkprogress when you sign up for medium learn morenever miss a story from thinkprogressget updatesget updatesdata

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf
