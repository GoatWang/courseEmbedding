httpwwwsaksincorporatedcom ■ r brad martin was best known for his leadership of saks fifth avenue the beleaguered luxury retailer the chairman and chief executive officer of saks incorporated he struggled to keep saks fifth avenue afloat amid low sales industry criticism and uncertain chain identity the parent companys  midmarket regional stores operated under the names proffitts mcraes younkers parisian herbergers carson pirie scott boston store bergners and saks off th along with a mailorder business folio and the luxury chain saks fifth avenue saks incorporated was listed on the new york stock exchange with a market value over  billion in  the company had  employees  billion in revenues and the number of department stores had decreased to  from southern legislator to department store magnate martin spent the s and s as a tennessee state representative and he also made a fortune in real estate he then decided to try his hand in the retail sector martin was the principal investor in the group that acquired proffitts in  at that time the company operated five department stores in metropolitan knoxville tennessee with annual revenues of approximately  million when martin joined the companys management in  proffitts was a million company martin applied his political wheeling and dealing skills to the boardroom businessweek called him a savvy dealmaker with a thirst for acquisitions july   he first made his mark in regional midmarket stores and purchased carson pirie scott herbergers and parisian in  he acquired the troubled saks fifth avenue chain for  billion adding around  stores in  states to his corporation at the time saks was the fourthlargest department store in the united states with annual revenues over  billion the purchase moved him into the ranks of luxury retailers forbes called martin a numbers guy with a knack for consolidation and costcutting and justfolks southern manners january   the fur coats notsosilver lining martins success in the midmarket department stores did not transfer to saks fifth avenue his supposed cash cow neiman marcus and kohls were formidable rivals to saks fifth avenue and the new chain struggled for a couple years while sales continued to fall to boost sales martin introduced new clothing lines and promoted inhouse expert christina johnson to chief executive of the chain he also consolidated operations such as creditcard processing legal services and logistics to motivate company buyers he created a new compensation and bonus plan tied to performance construction costs for new stores were also cut martin tried to create a cozier feel in the revamped stores with coffee shops and more colorful decor and by adding a lesspricey clothing line his take on luxury was unique luxury does not need to be exclusive or aloof or could we say snooty  businessweek  september   to appeal to more customers martin invested  million in an ecommerce site to increase traffic to the store and provide more products to current customers he spent tens of millions of dollars on the web site which generated at most  million a year in income martin pushed forward despite negative results firing many saks veterans in the process in  he began to add youthful more stylish shoes and jeans to attract teens and younger women in january  forbes accused martin of mixing mass with class and suffering from an identity crisis because of its mix of teen styles with pricey adult items january   by  martins luxury purchase was still afflicted by recession increased competition and  billion in debt though this caused him to sharply scale back on planned expansion between  and  martin opened  new saks fifth avenue stores expanded  more and closed four in july  he was forced to sell the saks creditcard operation to household international saks fifth avenue was hardhit by the drop in tourism to new york city following the terrorist attacks on the world trade center in  martin told businessweek that its taken longer to get to where i wanted but im pleased with our progress july   but analysts commented that the company had spread itself too thinly with its new acquisition and that marketing and the saks image needed work the company appealed mainly to older wealthy shoppers and failed to incorporate differences in regional tastes martin tried opening stores in secondtier markets and adding moderately priced store brands to assist him johnson accounted for the chains problems when she trained her buyers and looked at contemporary clothing lines for the new stores saks incorporated made a small profit in  and then lost  million in the first half of  wall street pressured martin to sell off the sickly saks fifth avenue to which he responded aint gonna happen  businessweek  september
