stewart discussed the incident on the daily show the following monday we decided to go to this place crossfire which is a nuanced public policy analysis show… named after the stray bullets that hit innocent bystanders in a gang fight so i go to crossfire and lets face it i was dehydrated its the martin lawrence defense… and i had always in the past mentioned to friends and people that i meet on the street that i think that show… um… blows so i thought it was only the right thing to do to go say it to them personally on their program but heres the thing about confronting someone with that on their show theyre there uncomfortable and they were very mad because apparently when you invite someone on a show called crossfire and you express an opinion they dont care for that… i told them that i felt their show was hurting america and they came back at me pretty good they said that i wasnt being funny and i said to them i know that but tomorrow i will go back to being funny and your show will still blow in january  cnn announced that it was canceling crossfire when asked about the cancellation cnns incoming president jonathan klein referenced stewarts appearance on the show i think he

second mostviewed episode of the daily show trailing only the  inauguration day episode it had  million total viewers and the next day the shows website saw its highest day of traffic in  although cramer acknowledged on the show that some of stewarts criticisms of cnbc were valid and that the network could do better he later said on the today show that stewarts criticism of the media was naïve and misleading criticism of fox news throughout his tenure on the daily show stewart has frequently accused fox news of distorting the news to fit a conservative agenda at one point ridiculing the network as the meanest sorority in the world in november  stewart called out fox news for using some footage from a previous tea party rally during a report on a more recent rally making the latter event appear more highly attended than it actually was the shows anchor sean hannity apologized for the footage use the following night a month later stewart criticized fox  friends cohost gretchen

crash the interview to address a very important issue “i’m a talkshow host as well—well i was years ago and i’m a jew” stewart told rubin “you probably had your choice of idolizing any talkshow host and you could have gone with a jew is what i’m saying”when kimmel tried to cut short stewart’s interruption stewart lectured him in hebrew saying “sheket b’vakasha” to ask for silence in hebrew he then asked will if he got the joke “did you get that will did you get that do you know who didn’t get that joke jimmy kimmel because he’s not a jew” stewart said jokingly railing against the young man

point because thats how hes spending retirementmelissa lockerjul  when will rubin became a man under jewish tradition the year old from media pennsylvania threw himself a jimmy kimmel livethemed bar mitzvah naturally when kimmel found out about the fete he video chatted with will to find out how the party went and how much everyone liked the theme their conversation was rudely interrupted though by none other than jon stewartwhile stewart may be bored in his retirement from the talk show world he felt compelled to crash the interview to address a very important issue “i’m a talkshow host as well—well i was years ago and i’m a jew” stewart told rubin “you probably had your choice of idolizing any talkshow host and you could have gone with a jew is what i’m saying”when kimmel tried to cut short stewart’s interruption stewart lectured him in hebrew saying “sheket b’vakasha” to ask for silence in hebrew he then asked will if he got the joke “did you get that will did you get that do you know who didn’t get that joke jimmy kimmel because he’s not a jew” stewart said jokingly railing against the young man luckily kimmel came up with compromise — will could have a jon stewartthemed
