ravallion director of the world bank’s research department will join georgetown as its inaugural edmond d villani chaired professor of economics in the spring semester “the faculty members of the economics department are excited to welcome him as a colleague but i anticipate that martins presence will be felt throughout the entire georgetown university community” says francis vella professor

scholarship on development economics his wideranging research includes his early work on famines as well as his research on the causes of poverty and the evaluation of antipoverty policies he is probably best known for his work on measuring global poverty including developing the international “aday poverty measure in the late s world bank economists observed that some developing countries
