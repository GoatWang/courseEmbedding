see more » frequently asked questions this faq is empty add the first question user reviews socialist standup comedy that isnt always funny but is always eyeopening  march   by bob the moo united kingdom – see all my reviews mark thomass show is a mix of standup satire and political expose each week his team focuses on a different cause or case of injustice or big business covering up etc examples include political transparency data protection nuclear waste treatment adverts in school books etc he presents his findings during a standup routinethis type of humour has a natural audience of students and antiglobalization protesters however theres plenty here for anyone whos politically aware to some degree each week a subject is picked and the truths behind it exposed  the show relies on people coming to them most of the time some of the subjects may be dull or not going anywhere but most are very interesting occasionally some of the episodes are nothing more than silly stunts that dont expose anything but are funny  for example dressing as hitler to praise a politician for his policies doesnt actually achieve anything despite being a cheap laugh but most of the time interesting facts come out of his showsmost times youre left feeling that you should do something and depending on the subject its not always clear what that should be but most of the time it is empowering to have someone doing the legwork for you to bring you some facts another strength of the show is that most of the time not all the time mt leaves it to us to decide what we think and doesnt force us to do anythinghe can be a bit of the angryred at times but then thats who he is as i said his standup isnt always funny  in fact it can be quite lazy  but the documentary film that backs him up is often eyeopening and informativeoverall this programme is consistently good and has been since it started in  right up to its present incarnation the mark thomas product   it definitely deserves a wider audience than its pm slot and cult following allows it to have its easy to see him the politicians jeremy beadle  pulling wacky stunts etc but really hes a very
