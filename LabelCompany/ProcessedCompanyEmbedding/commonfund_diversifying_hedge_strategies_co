mark jp anson asset allocation  industry knowledge  investment strategy  risk management share the post is the endowment model a crowded trade facebooktwittergooglelinkedinemailprint home    news  research    articles    is the endowment model a crowded trade stuck in the past or everevolving the endowment model gets a hard look eight years into the current market cycle with core tenets of the endowment model seemingly under stress for the last several years some investors have questioned the longterm viability of the model at issue are too many investors piling into the same ideas and thus squeezing out opportunities for better returns at this commonfund forum   general session three cios tackled questions designed to surface concerns about the model and provide insight based on their long experience the roundtable was moderated by mark j p anson phd chief investment officer of commonfund the participants were jeff pippin senior vice president and chief investment officer of pepperdine university and jennifer paquette former chief investment officer of the colorado public employees retirement association mark anson we’re going to talk about the endowment model and whether it’s a “crowded trade” a popular term that simply means too many people are piling into the same investment ideas the question is by having so many people pile in does that squeeze out the excess returns that might be associated with that investment idea normally that applies to talking about active managers or hedge funds but we’re going to take that idea of a crowded trade and broaden it to the fullblown portfolio concept that’s called the endowment model jennifer i’ll start with you we’ll go on to jeff and then i’ll throw my chips on the table the “endowment model” is a term that’s been part of the popular vernacular for some time people use it but very rarely do they actually stop to define what it means so to you what does the endowment model really mean jennifer paquette i look at it fairly simply in terms of it being a model that has more alternative investments in the portfolio and being fairly innovative in terms of looking at types of new and complex strategies from hedge funds to other strategies that fall into private markets or alternatives jeff pippin it’s kind of hard to define the endowment model because different institutions apply it differently in general i look at it as broadly equitybased with a significant allocation to alternatives and a willingness to take advantage of an illiquidity premium over the years more and more institutions are going into alternatives and private investments to diversify away from public markets and seek the potential for added return from illiquidity is diversification still the last free lunchor maybe just a free cup of coffee—mark anson anson from our perspective we view the endowment model as having three basic tenets one is an equity bias and the reason for that is tapping into the longterm premium associated with global economic growth as part of your intergenerational equity or trying to grow the portfolio over generations tying into that longterm growth premium is very important and the best way to try to do that is through the equity markets both public and private the second is diversification and i’ll come back to it in a moment because i do want to tee that up a bit more but basically diversifying not only away from stocks and bonds but also into alternative investments and then last it’s trying to capture that liquidity premium one of the things we do at commonfund is to measure the liquidity premium we measure it back over long periods of time on average it’s about  basis points over and above the public stock markets if youre going to lock up your capital in a private investment like private equity you should earn some premium over the public markets otherwise you should just buy the sp  and that longterm premium that we’ve measured is about  percent although right now our model indicates it’s closer to  percent but there’s always a catch just because the liquidity premium exists doesn’t necessarily mean you get to earn it you have to go out and find good managers who will earn it for you let’s come back to diversification something that has been referred to as “the last free lunch” if the endowment model really is a crowded trade do we still get that free lunch or is diversification today maybe just a free breakfast or free cup of coffee jennifer paquette i dont know what there is without diversification whether we get a coffee out of it or a breakfast or a lunch i think its really challenging to try and come up with other methods of managing an institutional portfolio we’ve talked some about correlations increasing across asset classes that’s something to take note of and think through in regard to your expectations for how various asset classes are going to behave in different circumstances going forward but i dont know what else there is without using different asset classes and strategies to build a portfolio to achieve your longterm funding goals anson so hard choices jeff how about you pippin diversification is something that we probably all struggle with how can we actually achieve diversification if you look back to the crisis in  and ’ a lot of us thought we were pretty diversified but when we looked at our portfolios and how they reacted to the crisis it didn’t look like we were diversified after all so it was a lesson not to completely trust the correlations that you use in building your portfolio youve got to look deeper to see how those things are going to react to each other in a crisis some people call it stress beta you can’t get the level of diversification from stocks and bonds anymore that you used to— doesnt work for our needs right now you can’t get  percent plus inflation out of  plus were coming into a situation where you might see bonds being more closely correlated with stocks as interest rates rise we focus a lot on diversifying away from equity risk and not wanting to be in the same position that we were in after the crisis one of the things that we have done is take a  percent allocation from our equity portfolios and put it in what we call a diversifying portfolio this is a group of hedge funds that we’ve modeled extensively and that we believe will give us an expected return with low or no correlation with equities the portfolio modeled out at around  percent historical returns with very low correlation among the managers and the strategies the benchmark is treasuries plus  we implemented it on june  of last year—just in time for brexit—but it did okay during brexit and continues to perform inline with its benchmark anson i want to ask another question is there a role for bonds in a diversified portfolio you talked about how lowyielding they are pippin this is the next thing that we’re turning our attention to because like most endowments we do have a bond portfolio we dont have a credit allocation we do credit opportunistically mostly in hedge funds and some distressed our allocation to fixed income is to intermediateterm treasuries and we have it there for two reasons  one we want to have a portion of our portfolio that is liquid and is not going to tank with the market we look at it as a source of dry powder you’re giving up return to have dry powder—optionality if you will—if you find you have better opportunities in which to invest and two we want to have two years of payout on hand so we have a  percent intermediate us treasury portfolio paquette i think theres a place for bonds in the portfolio in the pension world there tends to be higher allocations to fixed income than in in the endowment space but whether you’re in foundations and endowments or public funds bonds have a role in terms of providing liquidity when you need it or want it for other investments at colorado pera we call it the anchor to windward when i look at how institutions change their allocations i found it interesting that pepperdine chose to take assets from equities to put into that hedge fund portfolio what we sometimes see is people taking allocations from fixed income and then putting them in other equitylike investments so they’re really raising the overall equity risk of their portfolio i think it’s really important not only to consider what the right amount of fixed income is but about how we manage that asset class—that we’re not just managing it for a type downturn we’re not managing it just for a low rate or high rate environment but we’re looking for it to be a longterm diversifier even though at times it can be certainly highly correlated with equities weve evolved into being less passive and more active as we view ourselves as investors rather than just capital allocators—jeff pippin anson an observation i would make is that the bond market has sort of flipped if you go back to  and you look at whats now called the bloomberg barclays aggregate bond index which is an investmentgrade index it yielded about  percent and the duration a measure of bond beta was about  or  that has flipped around now the duration is now about  and the yield is only around  percent now you’re taking on more risk for less yield so as we think about bonds going forward it does seem like interest rates are likely to go up and that’s going to be bad for the bond market bonds are still a good shock absorber—the optionality that jeff was referring to the kicker is that over the last  years during this tremendous bond market rally you got to own these insurance policies called bonds and you got paid to own them because as interest rates went down bond prices went up going forward they’ll still be good insurance policies but you’ll have to pay for that insurance i want to come back to defining the endowment model again over time the model has evolved through three stages stage one was when endowments and foundations first began diversifying out of bonds into public equities stage two was diversification and trying to expand beyond bonds and public equities into things like hedge funds stage three entailed a more focused approach to try and capture the liquidity premium through private capital now we’re into stage four what is stage four pippin my team and i spend a lot of time discussing that question for us it comes down to how to remain equity investors we’re going to have to participate in growth over the long term we’re putting our bet on growth and we want to be owners not creditors we’ve evolved as an institution into being less passive and more active and that has to do with viewing ourselves more as investors rather than just capital allocators we’re spending a lot more time with our managers we’re trying to identify our best managers and then were asking to coinvest with them as opportunities arise we’ve increased our allocation to real assets because we believe that the threat of inflation given where we are in terms of the monetary cycle and where the economy is going is greater than deflation  we’ve had a hedge fund portfolio for a number of years spend a lot of time modeling it doing attribution analysis and gaining confidence in our managers at one point a couple of years ago we asked ourselves what do we really want from hedge funds do we really want to pay  and  to get a return that’s a little less than the public equity market with slightly less volatility the answer is no what we really need is alpha so we went back to that  equation and asked “what are you going to get from a  how are we going to get to  percent real” using some of these forecasts it didn’t look so great you’ve got to get it from alpha so we took our hedge fund bucket and did away with it we had a  percent hedge fund bucket we just took that out of our asset allocation and put it over in the equity allocation and so were treating our hedge funds as an alpha source an alpha engine  anson at commonfund we’re working on the same idea in our hedge fund portfolio which is to ensure we’re not paying  and  for market exposure which we define as exposure to the stock bond and credit markets so we are stripping out all the elements of market risk because we know we can get them more cheaply what’s left over is the alpha stream that jeff was talking about that’s what we concentrate on bringing into the portfolio and thats why we’ve redefined our benchmark for the hedge fund portfolio to be treasury bills plus  percent … because what we want to bring into the portfolio is not the systematic risk of the equity bond or credit markets but a differentiated return stream that we cant replicate cheaply otherwise under the equity framework we’ve gone through and renegotiated all of our fee structures we now know that every basis point of fees that we can reduce is another basis point in the client portfolios  that’s part of the next evolution of the endowment model yes we’re all expanding into alternative asset classes but let’s be cost effective as well as constructing efficient portfolios on a riskreturn basis  on the diversification side we’re using more factor analysis to build better diversification into our portfolios instead of doing the topdown dollar allocation diversification of the past we now diversify from the bottomup by decomposing every manager we look at into their risk factors and then combine those risk factors in the most diversified portfolio possible lastly on the liquidity premium as we talked about before we can now measure precisely what that the liquidity premium is that gives us a better sense of how we want to allocate private capital into portfolios so its less about changing something dramatically and more about refining the model thats what stage four is pippin if you look at a broad crosssection of private equity managers youre probably not going to get that liquidity premium youre going to get it by selecting the managers that have the skill and ability to give you that  to  basis points it’s not a given—you need to pick the right managers its really important to consider how to manage bonds—were not just managing them for a type downturn — jennifer paquette anson love this topic … it raises the question of whether private equity is a crowded trade if you go back to  there were only about  private equity funds or firms in the world there are now over  that’s a lot of private equity firms all competing to put private capital to work jennifer how do you play private equity paquette i think you’ve got to think long term and ask “do we want to be in private equity probably yes”  but i do think it’s a crowded trade and you need to pick your spots very carefully we’re looking at smaller managers investing in smaller companies  we’re trying to identify managers that we think can deliver alpha we’re being more conservative we’re doing more coinvests rather than pooled investing we have pockets of liquidity all over the portfolio because we believe that over the next four or five years there will be good opportunities to put money to work pippin we also think it’s crowded but the way we’ve approached investing in private equity is to have fairly similar allocations every year we’re not sure we have the ability to forecast what is going to be a good vintage year and what will not and really it’s going back to manager selection first we’re picking the manager and then we’re relying on the manager to deploy the capital when they see the opportunity knowing that they usually have an investment period of about four years or so anson we agree private equity is a crowded trade that said the industry is very different from  mostly what private equity firms were doing was to bid on conglomerates basically companies that had a mashup of different subsidiaries thrown together in a corporate mosaic those conglomerates were poorly understood and consequently typically undervalued what did private equity managers do they bought these conglomerates cheaply added some leverage and then broke them apart and sold them off piecemeal it worked like a charm until there were no more conglomerates left now the game is adding value and it’s not just leverage any smart chief financial officer knows how to use his or her balance sheet nowadays so bringing leverage to the table is not really a value driver anymore it’s operational expertise that drives value creation a private equity manager today has to understand the industry that the company is working in the competitive landscape the distribution the products the pricing of those products and how to be more efficient in the manufacturing process back to jennifer’s point typically it’s the smaller to midsize private equity managers that do better  let me turn to another topic king kong versus godzilla recently i wrote an article titled “active versus passive there is no debate” i started off talking about those cheesy old movies from japan that pitted king kong versus godzilla that’s sort of what the active versus passive debate has become it’s king kong versus godzilla active versus passive let’s say king kong is active and godzilla is passive who wins does there have to be a winner can both coexist paquette in my experience passive has a place so it isn’t either or being able to buy beta that’s inexpensive to the equity or fixed income market can be attractive there is a place for active management we’re not looking just for market returns we want market returns and then some active managers go through alternating periods of underperformance and outperformance versus the market do you think that you can predict when that cycle is going to begin and end i’m not sure i can so utilizing both is helpful at colorado pera we had different reasons for using passive in equities and fixed income in equities it was really related to cost and giving us that beta less expensively to add our overlay of active managers internal and external in fixed income it was a little different a fixed income index can give you such a broad array of securities that if youre running an active fixed income portfolio you might own    securities an index fund can have thousands of them we found it interesting to have that kind of very well diversified exposure from a seasoned index portfolio and it also related to the fact that we were running a lot of money internally if we ever got into a position where we lost some of our talent where would we go with our assets until we placed them with other managers we wanted that index sleeve as kind of a holding place should we need it at times pippin going back to the beginning of the bull market in bonds if we knew then what we know now we would have invested in year treasuries but that’s managing by looking in the rearview mirror today the only way that we get to  percent plus inflation is by being active we’re going to be facing a totally different environment in the next five to  years and what worked in the past is not going to work in the future i would definitely be king kong i never liked godzilla anson at commonfund we believe in active management but we also believe there’s opportunity to add passive certainly as we think about how we want to put on tactical overlays a more costeffective way to do this is passive to return to jeff’s point investors are influenced by what they see in their rearview mirror when you look backwards yes we have seen that active has underperformed in fact  was the worst year for active management over the last  so our view is deeply influenced by what we see in the rearview mirror what’s not so obvious is that going back to  every year that the sp  had a negative return active outperformed passive active managers have been a natural buffer in down market years and that’s a good thing to remember we’re into year  of economic expansion and sooner or later we will hit a speed bump and when that bump hits it will be good to have active management in the portfolio bear in mind as well we have had massive amounts of quantitative easing poured into the economy—and not only ours but those of europe britain and japan in july  the year treasury got down to an amazingly low yield of  percent what happened utility stocks became the new bonds in  when the sp was up only  percent utilities were up  percent remember utilities have a beta of  to  so they should be earning less than the sp  yet they were earning eight times more why investors were trading out of bonds and into utilities—stocks with very low betas very low growth rates but high dividend yields what’s the problem for active management  active managers dont buy utilities because they’re the most boring low growth stocks in the sp  and the russell  so the stocks that have done well recently are the ones that active managers tend not to trade in simply because they don’t generate any growth all these factors came into play and resulted in active not performing well recently keep in mind however that there are good reasons to adhere to active management i can’t think of a better one than what jeff indicated if you’re going to get to cpi plus  passive most likely doesn’t get you there  download the article cio roundtable is the
