revenues   in february  frn completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with writ whereby writ acquired  of the issued and outstanding capital stock of frn in exchange for  shares of the common stock of writ as a result of the reverse acquisition frn became writ’s whollyowned subsidiary and the former frn’s shareholders became controlling stockholders of writ the share exchange transaction with writ was treated as a reverse acquisition with frn as the accounting acquirer and writ as the acquired party          consequently the assets and liabilities and the

after the completion of the share exchange agreement the company’s consolidated financial statements included the assets and liabilities of both frn and writ the historical operations of frn and the operations of writ from the closing date of the share exchange agreement   on july   we modified our february  share exchange agreement and agreed to assume  in new debt which is shown as a reduction of our paidin capital   while the core business of front row networks remains the licensing production acquisition and distribution of musicrelated content and programming the core business is dependent upon negotiating and financing projects with schedules that are solely determined by third parties such as artists and rights owners in order to secure less cyclical entertainment product the company sought to license or purchase entertainment content that could be easily secured and distributed through the multiple distribution arrangements already established by the company and via the rapidly growing marketplace represented by consumers of mobile internet and tv settop devices to reach this goal during the fiscal year the company set out to acquire exclusive branded content and entertainment programming and achieved this goal through the acquisition of amiga games inc   on august   the company completed an acquisition transaction through a share exchange with amiga games inc whereby writ acquired  of the issued and outstanding capital stock assets and trademarks of amiga games inc in exchange for  shares of the common stock of writ as a result of the acquisition amiga

computers the two companies tap into the growing “retro gaming” marketplace building on the amiga “atari” and “msdos” brands delivering retrogaming titles adapted for modern devices as well as merchandise featuring brands and characters from the games   during the  fiscal year amiga games inc and retro infinity inc entered several marketing and distribution agreements including those with microsoft corporation and roku inc both agreements include minimum guarantees defined as advances against future sales additionally the retro infinity inc licensed dozens of classic games for distribution via the windows  roku player ios apple and android platforms although it was the company’s strategic goal to distribute a broad range of video game titles on the windows  and ios platforms during the th quarter of  lack of operating capital caused the company to temporarily halt software development funding which delayed the company’s overall gaming product release schedule this temporary reduction in operating capital was due to mainly to regulatory delays encountered in structuring writ’s equityline financing and the company’s difficulty in raising alternative investment capital due to its subpenny share price at the time   on january   the company changed the name of the corporation to writ media group inc and authorized a  for  reverse split of the company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock the name change was authorized to encompass the companys broadened activities including additional business plans and models and the acquisition and formation of new subsidiaries the equity restructuring was authorized to achieve the following a price per share  the rollback will increase the price per share to above  subpenny markets are getting harder to trade and next to impossible to finance b funding  with a sub penny share price the company was unable to fund because of dilution post rollback the share price should be well above  and allow management to close on numerous funding opportunities that have been presented c larger potential audience  with a higher share price the company will have access to investors who do not trade sub penny stocks such as institutions and europeans d listing in europe  the company will now be able to list its common shares for trading on a european stock exchange as colistings in europe are not accepted with a sub penny share price and e acquisitions  the company will be able to use common shares to acquire larger assets and other industry related companies           on january   writ’s equity line financing “elf” agreement with dutchess opportunity fund ii and its corresponding s registration statement was declared effective by the sec the elf agreement executed in september  allows but does not require writ to sell up to us of common stock to dutchess at a  discount to market price during the  month term compared to the company’s convertible debt financing elfs provide a lower discount to market that minimize dilution while increasing operating capital this additional financing source allowed the company to reduce debt and reduce the balance of the more expensive

corporation dtcc and the dtccs longstanding administrative chill on clearing writ stock certificates was removed dtcc resumed accepting deposits of the companys common stock for book entry transfer services as a result shareholders with online brokerage accounts at firms such as scottrade etrade td ameritrade and other full service brokerage firms are allowed to deposit new shares of writs common stock in the electronic system that controls clearance and settlement the reinstatement of the dtc depository services is an instrumental and enormous accomplishment for writ which greatly reduced the costs and expenses associated with private equity investments in the company   in september  the company launched two online point of sale platforms wwwretroinfinitycom and wwwamigagamesinccom to market its “retro” gaming titles directly to consumers both sales platforms initially offer only downloads for windows based computers the online store launch was completed in conjunction with an initial marketing program which featured nascar the rwr retro infinity nascar race team and the “drive to championship weekend” branding program in december  the company intended to launch additional titles on additional mobile platforms such as windows phone ios and android platforms so that the video game titles can be downloaded as apps on various mobile devices the company experienced additional financing delays which interrupted software development and caused the company to reschedule the anticipated release on mobile platforms into  the online store launch generated

to any other party   inflation   inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future however our management will closely monitor price changes in our industry and continually maintain effective cost controls in operations   off balance sheet arrangements   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities   seasonality   our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations this pattern may change however as a result of new market opportunities or new product introduction   critical accounting policies   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported including the notes thereto and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies if any we have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements these accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results of operations and require management’s difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements   long lived assets   in accordance with asc  property plant and equipment the company reviews the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and longlived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of longlived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property if any exceeds its fair market value          recent accounting pronouncements   we do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flow   controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the securities exchange act of  based on this evaluation the ceo and cfo concluded that because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of september   see our discussion at “item a controls and procedures” on form k for the year ended march     we have noted the following material weaknesses in our control environment     material weaknesses in our control environment our control environment did not sufficiently promote effective internal control over financial reporting throughout the organization this material weakness exists because of the aggregate effect of multiple deficiencies in internal control which affect our control environment including a the lack of an effective risk assessment process for the identification of fraud risks b the lack of an internal audit function or other effective mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of internal controls c and insufficient documentation and communication of our accounting policies and procedures as of september      material weaknesses in the staffing of our financial accounting department management had engaged an outside consultant to assist in the financial reporting however the number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company sec reporting and gaap is limited this weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for nonroutine and nonsystematic transactions there is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused or at least not be detected in a timely manner by this shortage of qualified resources    material weaknesses in segregation of duties the limited number of qualified accounting personnel results in an inability to have independent review and approval of financial accounting entries furthermore management and financial accounting personnel have widespread access to create and post entries in our financial accounting system there is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused or at least not be detected in a timely manner due to insufficient segregation of duties because of its inherent limitation internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate management is still determining additional measures to remediate deficiencies related to staffing   because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting   changes in internal controls   there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule af and df under the exchange act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting          legal proceedings

and asia in some cases front row networks will also sell merchandising and other products bolstered by both intheater and inapp advertising tailored around each artist andor event to maximize potential merchandising and sponsorship revenues          in february  frn completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with writ whereby writ acquired  of the issued and outstanding capital stock of frn in exchange for  shares of the common stock of writ as a result of the reverse acquisition frn became writ’s whollyowned subsidiary and the former frn’s shareholders became controlling stockholders of writ the share exchange transaction with writ was treated as a reverse acquisition with frn as the accounting acquirer and writ as the acquired party   consequently the assets and liabilities and the historical operations were reflected in the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the share exchange agreement were those of frn and will be recorded at the historical cost basis after the completion of the share exchange agreement the company’s consolidated financial statements included the assets and liabilities of both frn and writ the historical operations of frn and the operations of writ from the closing date of the share exchange agreement   on july   we modified our february  share exchange agreement and agreed to assume  in new debt which is shown as a reduction of our paidin capital   while the core business of front row networks remains the licensing production acquisition and distribution of musicrelated content and programming the core business is dependent upon negotiating and financing projects with schedules that are solely determined by third parties such as artists and rights owners in order to secure less cyclical entertainment product the company sought to license or purchase entertainment content that could be easily secured and distributed through the multiple distribution arrangements already established by the company and via the rapidly growing marketplace represented by consumers of mobile internet and tv settop devices to reach this goal during the fiscal year the company set out to acquire exclusive branded content and entertainment programming and achieved this goal through the acquisition of amiga games inc   on august   the company completed an acquisition transaction through a share exchange with amiga games inc whereby writ acquired  of the issued and outstanding capital stock assets and trademarks of amiga games inc in exchange for  shares of the common stock of writ as a result of the acquisition amiga games inc became writ’s whollyowned subsidiary   amiga games inc licenses classic prewindows computer game libraries and adapts and republishes the most popular

originally released for amiga brand computers the two companies tap into the growing “retro gaming” marketplace building on the amiga “atari” and “msdos” brands delivering retrogaming titles adapted for modern devices as well as merchandise featuring brands and characters from the games   during the  fiscal year amiga games inc and retro infinity inc entered several marketing and distribution agreements including those with microsoft corporation and roku inc both agreements include minimum guarantees defined as advances against future sales additionally the retro infinity inc licensed dozens of classic games for distribution via the windows  roku player ios apple and android platforms although it was the company’s strategic goal to distribute a broad range of video game titles on the windows  and ios platforms during the  th quarter of  lack of operating capital caused the company to temporarily halt software development funding which delayed the company’s overall gaming product release schedule this temporary reduction in operating capital was due to mainly to regulatory delays encountered in structuring writ’s equityline financing and the company’s difficulty in raising alternative investment capital due to its subpenny share price at the time          on january   the company changed the name of the corporation to writ media group inc and authorized a  for  reverse split of the company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock the name change was authorized to encompass the companys broadened activities including additional business plans and models and the acquisition and formation of new subsidiaries the equity restructuring was authorized to achieve the following a price per share  the rollback will increase the price per share to above  subpenny markets are getting harder to trade and next to impossible to finance b funding  with a sub penny share price the company was unable to fund because of dilution post rollback the share price

january   writ’s equity line financing “elf” agreement with dutchess opportunity fund ii and its corresponding s registration statement was declared effective by the sec the elf agreement executed in september  allows but does not require writ to sell up to us of common stock to dutchess at a  discount to market price during the  month term compared to the company’s convertible debt financing elfs provide a lower discount to market that minimize dilution while increasing operating capital this additional financing source allowed the company to reduce debt and reduce the balance of the more expensive convertible notes that were outstanding during the last quarter of the fiscal year   on february   the company completed its administrative and legal work with the depository trust  clearing corporation dtcc and the dtccs longstanding administrative chill on clearing writ stock certificates was removed dtcc resumed accepting deposits of the companys common stock for book entry transfer services as a result shareholders with online brokerage accounts at firms such as scottrade etrade td ameritrade and other full service brokerage firms are allowed to deposit new shares of writs common stock in the electronic system that controls clearance and settlement the reinstatement of the dtc depository services is an instrumental and enormous accomplishment for writ which greatly reduced the costs and expenses associated with private equity investments in the company   in september  the company launched two online point of sale platforms wwwretroinfinitycom and wwwamigagamesinccom to market its “retro” gaming titles directly to consumers both sales platforms initially offer only downloads for windows based computers the online store launch was completed in conjunction with an initial marketing program which featured nascar the rwr retro infinity nascar race team and the “drive to championship weekend” branding program in december  the company intended to launch additional titles on additional mobile platforms such as windows phone ios and android platforms so that the video game titles can be downloaded as apps on various mobile devices the company experienced additional financing delays which interrupted software development and caused the company to reschedule the anticipated release on mobile platforms into  the online store launch generated an increase in consumer traffic to the company’s websites and created awareness in the company’s product but generated minimal sales most consumers were interested only in the mobile versions of the gaming titles which were not yet available   the websites are currently being modified to accept payment for crowdfunding transactions and we launched the retro infinityamiga games crowdfunding platform supported by a social marketing campaign in the rd quarter of  the initial crowdfunding campaign was not successful so the company is seeking additional financing from strategic partners that will allow the company to resume and complete software development and commence product marketing activities          on june   the company authorized a  for  reverse split of the company’s issued and

party   inflation   inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future however our management will closely monitor price changes in our industry and continually maintain effective cost controls in operations   off balance sheet arrangements   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities   seasonality   our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations this pattern may change however as a result of new market opportunities or new product introduction   critical accounting policies   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported including the notes thereto and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies if any we have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements these accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results of operations and require management’s difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements          long lived assets   in accordance with asc  property plant and equipment the company reviews the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and longlived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of longlived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property if any exceeds its fair market value   recent accounting pronouncements   we do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flow   controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the securities exchange act of  based on this evaluation the ceo and cfo concluded that because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december   see our discussion at “item a controls and procedures” on form k for the year ended march       we have noted the following material weaknesses in our control environment     material weaknesses in our control environment our control environment did not sufficiently promote effective internal control over financial reporting throughout the organization this material weakness exists because of the aggregate effect of multiple deficiencies in internal control which affect our control environment including a the lack of an effective risk assessment process for the identification of fraud risks b the lack of an internal audit function or other effective mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of internal controls c and insufficient documentation and communication of our accounting policies and procedures as of december      material weaknesses in the staffing of our financial accounting department management had engaged an outside consultant to assist in the financial reporting however the number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company sec reporting and gaap is limited this weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for nonroutine and nonsystematic transactions there is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused or at least not be detected in a timely manner by this shortage of qualified resources           material weaknesses in segregation of duties the limited number of qualified accounting personnel results in an inability to have independent review and approval of financial accounting entries furthermore management and financial accounting personnel have widespread access to create and post entries in our financial accounting system there is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused or at least not be detected in a timely manner due to insufficient segregation of duties because of its inherent limitation internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate management is still determining additional measures to remediate deficiencies related to staffing   because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting   changes in internal controls   there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule af and df under the exchange act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   legal

to store pelecoins the platform also enables merchants and payment platforms to accept pelecoin digital currencyin the current digital currency landscape rules of emission prevent existing digital currencies from becoming more widely distributed and used all known systems generate new coins emission in a manner that disregards the currencys market value for example bitcoin generates  coins per minute while litecoin generates  coins per minute on a permanent basis without regard to the current value of the currencyadditionally new coins are distributed between active users miners whose computers participate in the generation process this model obligates the users to have not only a very deep knowledge of software programming but also expensive computer equipment as time passes the process becomes more sophisticated and expensive and less accessible to new minerspelecoins emission system differs in that it is based on a simple proprietary algorithm making it accessible to all and clear to its users the system generates pelecoins based upon a set of rules and events that increase the currencys worth such as new user registration acceptance of pelecoin for real goods or services and trade between pelecoins and real currencies usd euro etcthe initial distribution of newly generated coins is based on users participation in an event the emission and distribution of coins follow simple rules allowing unexperienced users to actively participate in the process and to earn significant amounts of coin in a short period of time instead of complicated searches for crypto configurations demanded by other crypto currency systems pelecoin automatically increases your account based upon your participation in a simple value eventhow does pelecoin worknew users can
