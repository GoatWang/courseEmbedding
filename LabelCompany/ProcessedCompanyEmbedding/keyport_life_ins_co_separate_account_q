through various direct and indirect wholly owned insurance companies including sun life us and keyport it proposes to simplify its corporate and operational structure so that it might operate more efficiently and reduce administrative and compliance costs to that end it intends to combine the operations of sun life us and keyport through the merger in june  sun life us and keyport entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement pursuant to which keyport will merge with and into sun life us leaving sun life us as the surviving company the merger including the transfers the mva transfer and related transactions has been approved by the boards of directors of sun life us and keyport and each partys sole shareholder the parties have obtained the other necessary formal regulatory approvals and expect to have the merger become effective on december   upon the effective date of the merger effective date sun life us will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of keyport and will become directly liable for keyports liabilities and obligations with respect to the keyport contracts then outstanding each keyport contract owner will become a contract owner of sun life us by operation of law the merger will not affect the provisions of or the rights and obligations under the keyport contracts moreover the merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the keyport contracts nor will the merger affect the values determined under the keyport contracts the net unit value of the keyport accounts in effect immediately after the transfers will be identical to the net asset value per unit of interest in effect immediately before the transfers the merger agreement will not affect the current owners of sun life us contracts the sun life us accounts and the keyport accounts collectively the accounts are not parties to the merger agreement which will be entered into at the insurance company level as a result of the merger the accounts which are registered under the  act will continue to maintain their separate account status as unit investment trusts under the  act and as separate accounts under applicable state insurance law the accounts will not be merged into one another no charges will be imposed on or other deductions made from the keyport accounts or the sun life us accounts in connection with the merger in addition no payments will be required or charges imposed under the keyport contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed no new investment options will be made available to owners of the keyport contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated each subaccount of the keyport accounts will continue to invest in the same underlying fund as that subaccount invested in prior to the merger the merger will not directly affect any of the management investment companies underlying either the keyport accounts or the sun life us accounts collectively the funds the funds will not be a party to the merger or any related transaction the investment objectives policies and restrictions of the funds will not be changed as a result of the merger or any related transaction no investment portfolios are proposed to be added to substituted by or terminated by the funds in connection with the merger or any related transaction moreover the merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the funds the funds assets or the charges imposed on the funds or their shareholders in addition although the principal underwriter for keyport may change after the merger the principal underwriter will continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of sun life us holdings sun life us and keyport have determined that no provision of the keyport contracts or state law provides the owners of those contracts the keyport contract owners with any right to optout of or to vote on or otherwise consent to the merger rather the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies moreover none of the events affecting the keyport accounts in connection with the merger require a vote of keyport contract owners under the  act in addition as described above the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the keyport contracts will not change except that sun life us will become the depositor of the keyport accounts consequently keyport contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the merger all direct and indirect costs of the merger will be borne by sun life us or keyport and not by any owners of sun life us or keyport contracts b the transfers pursuant to the merger agreement each of the keyport accounts will transfer intact to sun life us and become part of sun life us on the effective date each transferred keyport account will change its name and have sun life us as its depositor rather than keyport no other changes to the keyport accounts will result from the merger the assets and liabilities that comprise the keyport accounts immediately prior to the merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of sun life us as the surviving company after the merger in addition the keyport accounts will continue to fund the same keyport contracts they did immediately prior to the merger after the merger sun life us intends to accept additional payments under the transferred keyport variable contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the contracts currently being offered but for the change in depositor sun life us will administer the keyport variable contracts in the same manner as keyport did immediately prior to the merger c the mva transfer pursuant to the merger agreement keyport will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the keyport mva contracts to sun life us and sun life us will assume keyports obligations under such contracts on the effective date as a result of the merger each nonunitized separate account of keyport that funds the keyport mva contracts will become a nonunitized separate account of sun life us at the same time sun life us will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of keyport and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of keyport under the keyport mva contracts issued prior to the merger the mva transfer will not change the terms of the keyport mva contracts except for the succession of sun life us as the insurer under the keyport mva contracts and it will not adversely affect the values determined under or the economic interests of the owners of those contracts after the merger sun life us intends to accept additional payments under the transferred flex premium mva contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the contracts currently being offered sun life us will administer the flex premium mva contracts in the same manner as keyport did immediately prior to the merger sun life us does not intend to offer additional single premium mva contracts or accept additional payments under outstanding single premium mva contracts or file posteffective amendments to the  act registration statement for the single premium mva contracts d procedural matters sun life us will file new registration statements on form n or form n as applicable under the  act to reflect the change in depositor of the keyport accounts and sun life uss assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of keyport under the keyport variable contracts the registration statements will include financial statements reflecting consummation of the merger and reflect sun life uss sponsorship of the keyport accounts as a result of the merger but will retain the historical financial information of the keyport accounts sun life us will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date the prospectuses included in the new registration statements will be sent to all keyport contract owners sun life us also will file a new registration statement on form s under the  act for the flexible premium mva contracts sun life us will seek to have the registration statement declared effective on or immediately following the effective date the new registration statement will reflect sun life uss assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of keyport with respect to the flexible premium mva contracts pursuant to the merger each person who owns a keyport mva contract at the time of the mva transfer will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer following the effective date sun life us will not make offers or accept payments under the keyport contracts until the new registration statements filed with the commission are effective iii analysis a introduction as discussed more fully below it is our view with regard to the proposed merger including the transfers and the mva transfer that  section  of the  act and rule  thereunder are inapplicable to the merger and no registration statements on form n are required  section  of the  act is inapplicable to the merger and  section  of the  act is inapplicable to the merger but if section  is viewed as applicable to the merger transactions the transactions will comply with the conditions of section a of the  act and rule a thereunder neither sun life us nor keyport seeks noaction reassurance under section a or section d of the  act with respect to the transfers in support of our views we note that the proposed merger is analytically the same as numerous reorganizations that have been the subject of previous noaction requests seeking substantially identical relief from the provisions of the  act and  act noted above to which the staff responded favorably and which deal with stock and mutual life insurance companies involved in mergers where one or both of such companies issued variable insurance products in connection with the relief sought in this request the proposed merger poses no different issues than those present in these previous transactions b section  of the  act and rule  thereunder are inapplicable to the transfers and the mva transfer  transfers in our view the succession of sun life us to the position of depositor for the keyport accounts and coissuer of the keyport variable contracts pursuant to the transfers and any related transactions will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of section  of the  act or rule  thereunder rule  an interpretive rule adopted by the commission provides guidance on when certain corporate reorganizations may entail the offer or sale of a new security in exchange for outstanding securities of a corporation involved in the reorganization similar to the facts in previously issued noaction letters the terms of the merger agreement will not result in any material change to the keyport variable contracts except that by operation of law the identity of the sponsordepositor will be different these previously issued noaction letters involve circumstances virtually identical to those presented above two insurance companies merging where one or both of the companies have variable contracts outstanding each of the previously issued noaction letters indicates that just as in this case the assets and liabilities that comprised the separate account remained intact after the merger and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company in this case the keyport accounts will remain intact after the merger and the assets of each of the transferred keyport accounts will be legally segregated from all other assets of the depositor and will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity the transferred keyport variable contracts will continue to provide contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed merger as before including surrender rights loan privileges annuity options and death benefits in addition the keyport variable contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred keyport accounts albeit under a new name investing in the same underlying investment vehicles as are currently available under the keyport contracts the financial history of the transferred keyport accounts will be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by sun life us which will be reflected by filing an amendment to each registration statement of a keyport account under the  act will not change furthermore the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the keyport variable contracts by sun life us by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the contracts that cause them to be treated as securities ie the variable nature of the benefits under the keyport variable contracts which benefits will continue to be based on the same pool of assets as discussed above the merger is not subject by either state law or federal securities law to the vote or consent of the contract owners of either sun life us or keyport there is no material change to the security aspect of the keyport variable contracts issued by keyport and no new or different investment options will be made available to the contract owners as a result of the merger the only changes involved are the change in the depositor of the transferred keyport accounts and the assumption of existing keyport variable contracts by sun life us since there will be no vote of the contact owners relating to a new investment decision or otherwise rule  does not apply for the same reasons set forth in the aforementioned noaction letters based on the foregoing we have concluded that neither section  of the  act nor rule  thereunder is applicable to the proposed transfers and any related transactions moreover with respect to registration statements under the  act we believe that no registration statement on form n will be required to be filed in connection with the merger nonetheless we believe that the registration statements for the transferred keyport variable contracts issued through each keyport account as separate accounts of sun life us need to be in effect under the  act to cover any securities issued after the merger which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred keyport variable contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and any new keyport variable contracts issued thereafter as noted above in connection with effecting the merger sun life us and the keyport accounts will file new registration statements with the commission under the  act for the transferred keyport variable contracts which registration statements will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the merger these new registration statements which will be filed on form n or form n as applicable will reflect the change in depositor of the keyport accounts and sun life uss assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of keyport under the keyport variable contracts because the transfers are to be made in connection with the merger of keyport into sun life us the registration statements also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the merger the new prospectuses will be sent to all owners of keyport variable contracts outstanding at the time the transfers are effected and will retain the historical financial information of the keyport accounts and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the keyport variable contracts after the merger prior to the effective date owners of outstanding keyport variable contracts would have received disclosure from keyport informing the owners of the proposed merger including the transfers  mva transfer in our view the mva transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act no change will be made to the keyport mva contracts by virtue of the mva transfer except that sun life us will succeed keyport as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the keyport mva contracts these rights and benefits ie surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc will remain the same keyport will transfer its nonunitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the keyport mva contracts intact to sun life us consequently when the mva transfer becomes effective sun life us will hold these assets in the same nonunitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer as discussed above owners of keyport mva contracts will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the merger including the mva transfer and will not by virtue of the merger have available any new or different investment options consequently owners of keyport mva contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the mva transfer we believe however that the registration statement for the transferred flexible premium mva contracts needs to be in effect under the  act to cover any securities issued after the merger which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred flexible premium mva contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and any new flexible premium mva contracts issued thereafter as noted above in connection with effecting the merger sun life us and the keyport accounts will file a new registration statement with the commission under the  act for the transferred flexible premium mva contracts which registration statement will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the merger the new registration statement which will be filed on form s will reflect sun life uss assumption of keyports contractual obligations and liabilities with respect to the contracts pursuant to the merger because the transfers are to be made in connection with the merger of keyport into sun life us the registration statement also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the merger the new prospectus will be sent to all owners of flexible premium mva contracts outstanding at the time the transfers are effected and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the flexible premium mva contracts after the merger prior to the effective date owners of outstanding flexible premium mva contracts will have received disclosure from keyport informing the owners of the proposed merger including the transfers c section  of the  act is inapplicable to the transfer of the keyport accounts it is our view that the succession of sun life us to the position of depositor for the transferred keyport accounts as a result of the merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to section  of the  act and therefore can and should be effected through the amendment of existing registration statements of the keyport accounts under the  act the filing of these amendments with the commission will be made as part of the process of filing new  act registration statements discussed above for the keyport contracts these amendments will reflect sun life us as the depositor of the keyport accounts and the transfer of contractual obligations and liabilities from keyport to sun life us as of the effective date this procedure will not necessitate the filing of new notifications of registration or registration statements for the transferred keyport accounts pursuant to section  of the  act the proposed merger will cause a change in the depositor for the keyport accounts which will involve a change in the coissuer of the keyport contracts the resulting change in the depositor due to the transfers of the keyport accounts however will not change the structure or operations of the keyport accounts or the relationship of the keyport accounts to their depositor or to the keyport contract owners the keyport accounts will continue to be treated as separate entities for all relevant purposes including financial reporting sun life us and the keyport accounts accordingly will amend the existing registration statements for the transferred keyport accounts under the  act on the effective date as discussed above d section  of the  act is inapplicable to the merger based on the analysis set forth above relating to section  of the  act it also is our view that the merger including the transfers and any related transactions will not involve an exchange of securities issued by an investment company for any other security of an investment company for purposes of section  of the  act nonetheless should these transactions be viewed as an offer of an exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of section  of the  act we believe that the transactions will comply with the conditions of section a of the  act and rule a thereunder accordingly commission approval should not be required under section  of the  act in connection with effecting the merger including the transfers and any related transactions similar to the facts in previously issued noaction letters the terms of the merger agreement will not result in any change to the keyport variable contracts except that by operation of law the identity of the depositor will change these previously issued noaction letters involved circumstances substantially similar to those presented above two insurance companies merging with one or both of the companies having variable contracts outstanding each of the previously issued noaction letters indicates that just as in this case the assets and liabilities which comprised the funding separate account after the merger remained intact and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company in this case the assets in each of the transferred keyport accounts will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity the transferred keyport variable contracts will continue to provide contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed merger as before including surrender rights loan privileges annuity options and death benefits in addition the keyport variable contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred keyport accounts albeit under a new name the financial history of the transferred keyport accounts will be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by sun life us the keyport variable contracts will not change furthermore the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the keyport variable contracts by sun life us by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the contracts that caused them to be treated as securities ie the variable nature of the benefits under the keyport contracts iv noaction request in view of these circumstances we respectfully request that the staff issue a letter stating that the staff will not recommend that the commission take any enforcement action against sun life us or keyport under section  of the  act and rule  thereunder in connection with the transfers and the mva transfer or under sections  and  of the  act in connection with the transfers if the merger is effect as described herein in addition we request that the staff further indicate in this letter that the staff will not recommend that the commission take any action if  the change in the depositor for the transferred keyport accounts as a result of the merger is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the keyport accounts under the  act and  new registration statements for the transferred keyport contracts under the  act are filed by sun life us and the keyport accounts to cover any securities issued in connection with the keyport contracts after the merger is effected if you have any question or require

specific needsknowing your properly covered if and unpredicted event many occur feels good to know i have brad mclane agency on my sidedid you knowinsurance basicsto mitigate the risk of loss people purchase insurance policies from a company when buying a policy the person agrees to pay a premium which is small regular payment based on the losses that may occur if the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy the premium is usually higher premiums are often paid monthly and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured itemmany types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item the amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible in the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what if the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount the insurance company does not pay anything if the cost is greater than the deductible the policyholder only pays the deductible while the insurance pays the rest generally the deductible amount is related to your premium with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium and viceversainsurance agents selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage this is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most based on their needs and individual risk agents can often give potential customers a quote which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy this is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly credit scores play a major role in insurance scores but past insuranceclaim history is also taken into accountwhile agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance some sell several different types of insurance agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently selling policies from several different insurersinsurance productsalmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all useautomotive insurance millions of americans drive a car to get from place to place each day so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types in most states the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car up to a certain amount most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident its important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others not the policyholder themselves in addition to liability insurance car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident for this purpose liability vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policyinsurance can also be purchased for other vehicles like motorcycles atvs boats or rvs and generally functions similarly to car insurance policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles atvs boats and rvshomeowners insurance your home condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for so it makes sense to get it insured homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policylike auto insurance homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items the primary coverage type is for the dwelling insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it policies may also cover property within the home with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for much like auto insuranceproperty insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control these are known as perils and may include fire flooding natural disasters and other catastrophic events you may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a highrisk area flood insurance is an exception however and can be purchased through the governmentsponsored national flood insurance program your lender may require this if you live in a floodprone areahealth insurance to help pay for medical expenses many people rely on their health insurance with the passing of the affordable care act almost every american is required to enroll in a health care plan or they face a penalty health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance although it is probably used to cover expenses more often since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine health insurance also operates on a premiumdeductible model and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle for example if you visit doctors very infrequently you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible on the other hand people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by lawlife insurance when someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost life insurance comes in two basic types term and universal with a term life insurance plan you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time usually  years or more if you die at any point in that timeframe your family receives a death benefit if youre still around when the term is over the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing universal life covers your entire life and usually delivers a minimum benefit at deathtravel insurance travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel whether its losing luggage or medical treatment abroad travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trippet insurance pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog cat or other domestic animal medical care for animals can be very costly particularly because insurance for them is rare by paying into a premium you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication while virtually unheard of a few years ago pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to riseumbrella insurance umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies usually home or auto insurance consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover for example most car insurance liability policies cover at least  per person or  per accident but if the accident involves a very valuable car or the victim is willing to pursue legal action insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost you may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policyinsurance claims basicsto receive a payout for an insurance policy the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company the basics of the process are straightforward but can vary depending on the type of insuranceclaims adjusters and examiners a claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided an adjuster inspects claims related to property damage as in the case of auto or home insurance policies claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedureshow to make a claim filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses its important to note that in the case of emergencies you should always call  first the safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insuranceauto insurance claim if youre involved in an accident you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation you can file a claim upon obtaining the police report its also a good idea if possible to take your own notes at the scene the most important things to record are what happened before the accident the date and time traffic signs in the area and road conditions also be sure to get the other drivers name address license plate number and insurance information even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process once you have this documentation call your insurance company right away homeowners insurance claim in the case of damage take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible if any of your possessions were damaged use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim once an adjuster has made their own report review it for accuracy life insurance claim send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan as well as a certified copy of the policyholders death certificate with the proper information life insurance claims are generally straightforward problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy in this case an attorney may be needed to settle the claimfinding discounts on insuranceinsurance is a wise investment but it can make a dent in your monthly budget thankfully there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you needshop and compare perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible even after youve chosen a plan and started paying into it consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy while traditional agents can still find a good deal independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs the internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before potential customers can often get free quotes online very quicklybuy only what you need insurance agents will often try to upsell on various extra products that may be useful for certain people but are generally excessive for the average consumer stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs for example if the annual cost of your auto insurance is  percent or more of the total value of your car drop all but the most essential coverage this is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings otherwise you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash it can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policytake advantage of discounts insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances in one of the most basic discounts many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home auto and life insurance policies from the same provider car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course for those with teenagers on their plan good grades can earn a small discount as well insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel federal employees teachers first responders and their families we just redesigned ypcom do you
