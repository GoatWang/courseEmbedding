dispatched partner edward a gilhuly to london to set up a fulltime european operation five years ago it looked as if the old worlds tranquil privateequity business would soon get some rockemsockem dealmaking not so fast by the end of  a year after his arrival gilhuly had done only two deals totaling less than  million  a ripple in the  billion european privateequity ocean that year instead of chasing deals he concentrated on recruiting european experts who could navigate the political regulatory and financial complications of crossborder transactions doing business in europe is more complex than in the us gilhuly says but if you can do it well not many people will be able to compete with you now gilhuly  is proving his thesis with a vengeance kkr has become one of europes hottest shops with more than  billion in deals in the past two years including the regions biggestever privateequity deal the  billion buyout of french electric equipment company legrand in  gilhuly and his team have zeroed in on just a few industries  financial services retailing and chemicals  where they look for companies in need of a tuneup of course what really matters to privateequity investors is

political resistance when they bid for highprofile european businesses thats why kkr has often teamed up with local investors as on the legrand deal where it paired with a leading french group wendel
