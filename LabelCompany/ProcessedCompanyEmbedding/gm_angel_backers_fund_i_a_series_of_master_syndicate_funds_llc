 tips for crowdfunding how to raise money from strangers by rich brooks september  0 sharek tweetk share pin  email pocketshares kdo you need to raise funds to get your idea off the ground you’ve got a brilliant business idea but your bank lacks your vision or perhaps you lack the collateral maybe you reached out to friends and family but you know they lost their shirts when your brotherinlaw’s salmonflavored energy drink flopped is this the death of your nascent business not so fast social media is changing more than the way we market and communicate… it’s changing the way we raise capital crowdfunding websites are popping up that connect entrepreneurs with investors producers with patrons and causes with contributors what is crowdfunding crowdfunding builds upon the idea of crowdsourcing “the act of outsourcing tasks traditionally performed by an employee or contractor to an undefined large group of people or community a “crowd” through an open call” wikipedia crowdfunding pulls together a community—tightly knit or disparate—to fund a project business or cause usually via the internet how does it work although the rules differ from site to site generally people or businesses or charities pitch an idea set a fundraising goal and set a deadline for raising funds potential patrons can review the pitches and decide if there are any they’d like to support on most crowdfunding sites people are not investing in the project or business rather they are funding it they are rewarded if the project comes to fruition but don’t end up owning any part of the business or project this is in part due to us regulations currently under review by the sec so this may change in the near future however different sites have different rules especially those based outside the us so make sure you review the terms and conditions carefully to launch your own project i’ll focus on kickstarter—one of the most popular crowdfunding sites—as an example you start with a pitch you describe your project specify what rewards patrons will receive if the fundraising is successful and create a funding goal and a timeline if you don’t reach your funding goal by the deadline no money changes hands as kickstarter says this “protects everyone involved creators aren’t expected to develop their project without necessary funds and it allows anyone to test concepts without risk” pledges are made with a credit card if you’re backing a project your card won’t be charged until the project is successfully funded how do you get your projects noticed… and funded a quick look at the active projects on kickstarter or indiegogo will show that you’ve a lot of creative competition out there here you can see that its a competitive marketplace to catch the eye of potential funders you’re going to need to stand out engage your community and close the sale here are  tips to help you secure funding  choose the right crowdfunding site although there’s plenty of overlap in many of the crowdfunding sites out there each caters to a specific audience are you a creative be sure to check out kickstarter or indiegogo looking to start more of a traditional albeit entrepreneurial business head over to profounder does your idea have a social bent you might do well at buzzbnk or needs nonprofits can fundraise at sites like causevox or firstgiving in the nonichetoosmall category is appbackr that focuses exclusively on mobile app businesses choosing the right site can make all the difference  know your target audiences anthony kaufman recommends identifying your target audiences like jennifer fox did while raising money for her film my reincarnation fox had two builtin niche audiences to target fans and followers of her primary subject tibetan buddhist master chögyal namkhai norbu of which there are many worldwide and the estimated  people that fox cultivated during the grassroots release of her last film 00’s “flying confessions of a free woman” focusing on a passionate niche can help too many of the successful projects on crowdfunding sites target a specific narrow audience the target audience might be focused in a geographic area religious in nature or share a common background graphic novels and music tend to do well too targeting an audience is key to your success  plan ahead according to john t unger an artist and designer who has successfully funded a project on kickstarter the best advice i have is to plan ahead a kickstarter project can go by really quickly the vast bulk of backers seem to happen at the very beginning and very end of a project according to kickstarter’s own data that makes sense… it’s exciting when it’s new and it’s exciting when it’s down to the wire in the future i’ll be sure that i have emails written specifically for the beginning middle and end of a project so that i can keep it active when a project does take off it can be kind of overwhelming to respond to everyone quickly enough so faqtype emails that are prewritten help a lot too craig mod who successfully raised  on kickstarter reiterates this idea of the reverse bell curve of patron interest in his excellent article kickstartup – successful fundraising with kickstartercom  the remaking of art space tokyo “people engage things a when they’re brandnew or b when they’re nearing a deadline we lose interest in that middle space” planning ahead and preparing email blasts can be the difference between success and failure  passionately pitch your project you’ve heard the old saying “you only get one chance to make a first impression” well it’s even tougher on popular crowdfunding sites where there are 0 other projects simultaneously trying to make a first impression on the same page your project name graphics and description all play an important role   create a compelling name description and an image as part of your project to help you stand out a video is critical too see  for more on that  have a plan for spending their money no matter how cool your idea is most people want to know that you’ve got a plan that will get you there ricebowlproject suggests that you “give a detailed explanation of how exactly you’ll be using their money and keep all costs transparent this will build trust in you and credibility in your project” people like to invest in a solid plan   leverage your social networks it’s important to realize that most of your audience may not be familiar with crowdfunding chances are you’ll need to use social media email marketing and other communication tools to drive your community to your project at a crowdfunding site unger says crowdfunding sites aren’t “much different from any other launch in a lot of ways—so to get attention i used the same tools as usual email to the list twitter facebook etc” yet again the importance of listbuilding and networking can’t be overstated do you need help leveraging your social networks social media examiner is filled with

projects none of your potential patrons are likely to drop 0 on your next big thing if they were that flush they’d probably be investing with bernie madoff hmmm… maybe they were your project has a better chance of reaching its funding goal if you break the project into smaller bitesized pieces you might break your video into filming editing and distribution rather than trying to raise enough to start a business and make payroll for two years start by raising enough to build a prototype of that solarpowered toothbrush you’ve been dreaming about break your bigger project into smaller fundable pieces people like to feel like their contribution is going to make a difference fifty dollars makes a bigger splash when you’re raising  than when you’re raising  smaller requests seem more attainable and people want to feel like they’re on a “winning team”  create compelling rewards kris white offered plenty of rewards for patrons of his graphic novel the  some were fairly standard including a pdf copy of chapter  for pledges of  however four patrons who were willing to pledge  each could get their name and likeness “immortalized” as a supporting character in the story being immortalized in a comic thats super man  treat your crowdfunding like a campaign pitching a project is the beginning not the end of your work you need to continually drive people to your project page many crowdfunding sites use traffic and early success as indicators of which projects to feature indiegogo states that 0 of deciding who gets featured comes down to “pageviews number of funders  of goal completed”  tell a great story… and ask for the sale as jeanie finlay says in her post adventures in crowd funding “when i launched the first campaign i simply put up the trailer and we raised about  pence… i made a new trailer with me pitching the film… it made a world of difference i now believe that people invest in the filmmakers as much as the project”  promise—and give—credit where credit is due people love to be acknowledged whether it’s on the liner notes film credits or etched into the wall in your retail space let people know how they’ll be credited and follow through it
