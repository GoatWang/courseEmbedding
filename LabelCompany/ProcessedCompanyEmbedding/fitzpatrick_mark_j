technicians mark j fitzpatrick   assistant professorsw lab sw markfitzpatrickutorontoca the fitzpatrick labresearch interests my research program centres on the genetics of complex trait evolution complex traits eg lifespan body size disease resistance and behaviour are unified by two common characteristics i they are the product of multiple genes and ii their phenotype is often significantly influenced by changes in the environment understanding the ontogeny manifestation and evolution of complex traits is a central focus in evolutionary genetics my work focuses on behaviour because behavioural traits have enormous potential to contribute to our knowledge of complex trait evolution behaviour is intriguing since abilities i require precise coordination of proteins enzymes neurons and muscles ii are affected by constant input and processing of information from the environment and iii are extremely labile and can be modified at each expression keywords behaviour genetics evolutionary genetics pleiotropy epistasis frequencydependent selection behavioural ecology neurogenetics complex traits candidate gene approach research area neuroscience and behaviour biochemistry cell and molecular biology conservation ecology and evolution current research a detailed understanding of the evolution and ecology of behaviour can be gained by investigating the underlying genes studies of genes are important because they can integrate both mechanistic and evolutionary insights boake et al  robinson 9 and they can allow for precise manipulation and measurement of behaviours in the lab and in the wild given the extensive conservation of gene function across diverse evolutionary lineages it is now becoming possible to explore particular genes in a wide variety of organisms eg a candidate gene approach i focus primarily on the roversitter foraging polymorphism found in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster and discovered by marla sokolowski in the early s rovers eat less but move more than sitters during foraging kaun et al a and they are more likely to explore new food patches than sitters sokolowski et al  these behavioural differences arise mainly from allelic variation in foraging for which encodes a cgmpdependent protein kinase pkg osborne et al  rovers forr have higher rna transcript levels and pkg activity levels than sitters fors this polymorphism has now become a classic model system in behaviour genetics my research explores i the evolutionary link between foraging behaviour and cgmpdependent protein kinase fitzpatrick  sokolowski  ii identifying additional genes that influence foraging behaviour fitzpatrick et al in prep and iii the maintenance of the roversitter polymorphism by frequencydependent selection fitzpatrick et al i have broad interests in behavioural ecology evolutionary genetics quantitative genetics phylogenetics and genomics although my lab will primarily utilize the drosophila model system we will also continue to dabble in other organisms such as crickets topics of particular interest include foraging behaviour sexual selection and aggression for example some peripheral interests include how pleiotropic effects can influence the evolution of genes affecting sexual selection fitzpatrick  and whether mating influences aggression in field crickets teaching interests  bioah life on earth unifying

chief executive officer and a member of the company’s board of directors effective october    mr fitzpatrick currently serves as chiasma’s chief financial officer  he succeeds mark leuchtenberger who has stepped down as chief executive officer to pursue other opportunities  this action follows chiasma’s announcement of corporate restructuring actions in june and august  which were made after receiving a complete response letter crl from the us food and drug administration fda in april  regarding the new drug application nda for its lead product candidate mycapssa® octreotide capsules “we extend our sincere appreciation to mark leuchtenberger for his contributions to chiasma these past  months” said dave stack chairman of the board of chiasma  “mark was instrumental in recruiting a premier sales organization and commercial infrastructure in anticipation of a potential commercial launch earlier this year  the board appreciates these efforts and wishes mark well as he begins his pursuit of new opportunities within the industry” mr fitzpatrick joined chiasma as its chief financial officer in june  and has over  years of experience in the biotechnology industry  he has held the seniormost financial leadership position and reported directly to the ceo of both public and private technology companies since   “i am excited by the opportunity to assume greater responsibilities at chiasma and lead the company as we continue our mission to bring an oral treatment option to patients with acromegaly” said mr fitzpatrick about mycapssa mycapssa is the conditional trade name of octreotide capsules an investigational new oral drug in development for the maintenance therapy of adult patients with acromegaly  mycapssa has been granted orphan designation in the united states and the european union for the potential treatment of acromegaly  mycapssa has not been approved for use in any jurisdiction  about acromegaly acromegaly typically develops when a benign tumor of the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone gh ultimately leading to significant health problems and early death if untreated  there are an estimated 9 individuals with acromegaly worldwide  in  studies of acromegaly prevalence since  an average of approximately  cases per million was determined suggesting roughly  individuals with acromegaly in the united states of which an estimated  are treated chronically with somatostatin analog injections  because symptoms often develop slowly diagnosis may be delayed by years or decades making it difficult to determine the total number of people with the disease about chiasma chiasma is dedicated to improving the lives of patients who face challenges associated with their existing treatments for rare and serious chronic diseases using its transient permeability enhancer tpe® technology platform  the company is conducting an international phase  clinical trial of octreotide capsules conditionally tradenamed “mycapssa®” for the maintenance treatment of adult acromegaly patients to support a potential submission of a marketing authorization application to the european medicines agency  chiasma received a complete response
