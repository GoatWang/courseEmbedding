strategies farallon® seeks to achieve superior riskadjusted returns through a process of fundamental bottomup analysis we pursue multiple investment strategies on an opportunistic basis which include five core investment strategies credit investments longshort equity merger arbitrage real estaterelated investments and direct investments each investment is evaluated independently on a fundamental basis farallon invests globally focusing on developed and emerging markets alike we make investments in public and private debt and equity securities and direct investments in private companies and real estate farallon places a priority on the preservation of capital while we value and employ risk management analytics we primarily manage risk through rigorous research and analysis we also seek to build strong relationships with the management of the companies in which we invest credit investmentsthis category includes investments in companies experiencing financial distress or whose credit is viewed as marginal but improving or whose debt farallon believes is inexpensive relative to its underlying risk or delivers an attractive return  credit investments include noninvestment grade debt in leveraged or underperforming companies as well as companies experiencing a liquidity crisis defaulting on their debt obligations filing for chapter  bankruptcy protection or its equivalent undergoing liquidation or undergoing another corporate event such as a merger recapitalization reorganization or restructuring credit investments may also be made in anticipation of strengthening credit a repayment or refinancing an event of default or amendment or renegotiation of covenants or economic terms this category comprises mainly debt securities and instruments and debtlike securities and instruments including without limitation bonds and loans including highyield and mezzanine loans bonds and notes funded and unfunded bridge loans bank loans participations and subparticipations in such loans accounts and note’s receivable and payable held by trade and other creditors assetbacked securities and loans backed by loans leases or receivables commercial and residential mortgagebacked securities and loans credit default swaps and other types of derivatives preferred stock and convertible securities and warrants litigation claims and interests in liquidating entities farallon may purchase existing securities or instruments on a secondary basis or may purchase newly originated securities or instruments on a primary basis longshort equitythis category consists of investments and short sales in securities that we believe are underpriced or overpriced relative to their intrinsic or fundamental value  these mispricings may be caused by among other things general market conditions a companyspecific issue that farallon believes is temporary a change in management or strategic direction or a variation between farallon’s assessment of a company or its market and that of other market participants this category also sometimes includes investments in restructuring companies that are undergoing significant corporate events such as spinoffs recapitalizations litigation events strategic realignments and other major changes these investments typically are made in common stock we frequently seek to hedge our equity investments with short or long positions in individual company stocks or stock market indices or other derivative instruments merger arbitrageour merger arbitrage strategy is focused mainly on corporate takeovers each investment seeks to capture the spread between the current and projected values of securities of companies involved in a merger or acquisition to employ this strategy we typically establish a long position usually a purchase of common stock in an announced takeover candidate and if the proposed merger or acquisition is structured as a shareforshare deal take a short position in the company making the acquisition real estate investmentsthis strategy pursues investments in fee simple real estate leaseholds mortgages or other real estaterelated assets especially in cases where redevelopment leasing and addition of management expertise can add value farallon invests across a broad range of real estate assets with a focus on office retail multifamily and industrial assets and at various points in the capital structure of a real estate transaction investments typically involve the purchase of assets that we believe are undervalued or inefficiently managed or financed in particular assets that are valued at a significant discount to replacement cost or can be transformed to higher and better uses direct investmentsdirect investments in equity and debt of operating and services businesses and any other businesses may be made pursuant to any of the foregoing or other strategies such “direct investments” include private market transactions in which a debt preferred stock or equity investment is made typically with an expectation of receiving a cash return and generally achieving additional upside if the investment performs according to expectations for these investments farallon generally looks for inefficiently financed situations in which it can facilitate a recapitalization or situations in which traditional institutional financing is not available
