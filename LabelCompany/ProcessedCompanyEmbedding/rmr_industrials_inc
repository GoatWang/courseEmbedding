yearbook was incorporated in the state of nevada on august   online yearbook was a development stage company with the principal business objective of developing and marketing an online yearbook   on november   rocky mountain resource holdings llc a nevada limited liability company the “purchaser” became the majority shareholder of online yearbook by acquiring  shares of common stock of online yearbook the “shares” or  of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock pursuant to stock purchase agreements with messrs el maraana and salah blal the shares were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of  the purchaser was the source of the funds used to acquire the shares in connection with online yearbook’s receipt of approval from the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” effective december   online yearbook amended its articles of incorporation to change its name from “online yearbook” to “rmr industrials inc”   rmr industrials inc the “company” or “rmri” seeks to acquire and consolidate complimentary industrial assets typically these small to midsized assets are the core manufacturer and supplier of specific bulk commodity minerals and chemicals distributed to the global manufacturer industry rmri’s consolidation strategy is to assemble a portfolio of mature and valueadd industrial commodities businesses to generate scalable enterprises with a vast portfolio of products and services addressing a common and stable customer base   on february   the “closing date” the company entered into and consummated a merger transaction pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” by and among the company olyb acquisition corporation a nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the company “merger sub” and rmr ip inc a nevada corporation “rmr ip” in accordance with the terms of merger agreement on the closing date merger sub merged with and into rmr ip the “merger” with rmr ip surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary   rmr ip was formed to acquire and consolidate complimentary industrial commodity assets through capitalizing on the volatile oil markets down cycles in commodity markets and other ancillary opportunities rmr ip is focused on managing the supply chain in order to offer a large and diverse set of products and services   the merger agreement includes customary representations warranties and covenants made by the company merger sub and rmr ip as of specific dates the assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the merger agreement and are not intended to provide factual business or financial information about the company merger sub and rmr ip moreover some of those representations and warranties i may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date ii may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to shareholders or different from what a shareholder might view as material iii may have been used for purposes of allocating risk among the company merger sub and rmr ip rather than establishing matters as facts andor iv may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the merger agreement that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the merger agreement and generally were solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement   for financial reporting purposes the merger represents a “reverse merger” rather than a business combination and rmr ip is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction consequently the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the company’s future financial statements will be those of rmr ip the company’s assets liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with the assets liabilities and results of operations of rmr ip after consummation of the merger and the historical financial statements of the company before the merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of rmr ip before the merger in all future filings with the sec   on march   we formed united states talc and

united states for interim financial information in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec regulation sx rule  the unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial condition and results of operations of our whollyowned subsidiary us talc and minerals where intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in the opinion of management the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position as of june   and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended the financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim consolidated financial statements related to the period are unaudited    note b – summary of significant accounting policies   a summary of significant accounting policies of the company is presented to assist in understanding the company’s consolidated financial statements the accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements these consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity   consolidation   the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” the unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial condition and results of operations of our whollyowned subsidiary us talc and minerals where intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could materially differ from those estimates management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements management must apply significant judgment in this process in addition other factors may affect estimates including expected business and operational changes sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends the estimation process may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates although these estimates are based on the company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately materially differ from those estimated amounts and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements   segment reporting   operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decisionmaker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance the company views its operations and manages its business as one operating segment   f        cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents as of june   the company had cash of  and no cash equivalents the company may occasionally maintain cash balances in excess of amounts insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” the amounts are held with major financial institutions and are monitored by management to mitigate credit risk   deposits   deposits consist of a security deposit in connection with an office lease   other assets   other assets consist of a deposit towards the acquisition of certain intellectual property rights   impairment of longlived assets   the company evaluates longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered include     • significant changes in the operational performance or manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business     • significant negative market conditions or economic trends and     • significant technological changes or legal factors which may render the asset obsolete   the company evaluated longlived assets based upon an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset future net undiscounted cash flows include estimates of future revenues and expenses which are based on projected growth rates the company continually uses judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset    fair value measurements   the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices fair value measurements do not include transaction costs a fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories    level  quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level  observable marketbased inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data  level  unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data    net loss per common share   basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period without consideration for the potentially dilutive effects of converting stock options or restricted stock purchase rights outstanding diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and the potential dilutive effects of stock options or restricted stock purchase rights outstanding during the period determined using the treasury stock method there are no such antidilutive common share equivalents outstanding as june   which were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share   f        income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires among other things that deferred income taxes be provided for temporary differences between the tax bases of the companys assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   a valuation allowance is recorded by the company when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making such a determination management considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance when the company establishes or reduces the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets its provision for income taxes will increase or decrease respectively in the period such determination is made   additionally the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement accordingly the company establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions the company has not recognized interest or penalties in its statement of operations and comprehensive loss since inception   recent accounting pronouncements   the financial accounting standards board recently issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of financial statements  going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern the amendments require management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards specifically the amendments  provide a definition of the term substantial doubt  require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods  provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans  require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans  require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and  require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued the amendments in this update are effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter   management believes recently issued accounting pronouncements will have no impact on the financial statements of the company   note c – going concern   the companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however the company does not have significant cash or other current assets nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern   the company’s net loss and working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a goingconcern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the financial statements for the three months ended june   do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company may never become profitable or if it does it may not be able to sustain profitability on a recurring basis   f        under the going concern assumption an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations accordingly assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the business plan and eventually attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   during the next year the company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the securities and exchange commission and the payment of expenses associated with research and development the company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital   historically it has mostly relied upon funds from the sale of shares of stock and from acquiring loans to finance its operations and growth management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the company’s stock or through loans from private investors although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing the company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders   in the past year the company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock and proceeds from related party debt for the coming year the company plans to continue to fund the company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above
