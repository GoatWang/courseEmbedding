zinccoppersilvergold deposit in district in western eritrea the site comprises a large perhaps coeval and cogenetic intrusion known as the bisha gabbroic complex and s series of mafic to felsic tuffs with small flows and small sedimentary rocks in the proximal footwall and felsic flows fine tuffs and volcanicderived siliclastic rocks in the upsection the other two vms deposits are present along strike bisha northwest  km to northnorthwest and harena  km to the southsouthwest additionally a large lower grade vms deposit hambok is present about  km to the southwest the oxidation and supergene advancement have led to the development of four mineralogically and spatially distinct ore types or zones the hematitegoethitequartz gossan from  to m depth has high gold silver and lead contents with native gold argentiferous gold electrum anglesite and lesser cerussite the kaolinitequartzsulfate zone occurs at  to  m depth and also is enriched in gold silver and lead and has the same ore mineralogy as the gossan additionally it has minor chalcocite and minor to trace amounts of unusual zincleadiron carbonate and sulfate minerals the supergene sulfide zone is present from about  to  m in depth and has significant copper enrichment with predominantly chalcocite and lesser digenite covellite and bornite along with pyrite minor pyrrhotite anglesite and gangue minerals the primary massive sulfide from  to more than m depth has a noteworthy deposit of zincrich ore and a typical vms sulfide assemblage of pyrite sphalerite chalcopyrite and minor to trace galena pyrrhotite tetrahedrite tennantite arsenopyrite baryte and gangue deposit geologyedit the host rocks of the bisha deposit are for the most part felsic and intermediate lapilli ash and crystal fine to mediumgrained feldspar quartz biotite locally hornblende ash tuffs that are variably altered minor feldspar and quartfeldspar felsic flows and flow breccias are present only to the west of the deposit generally the volcanic host rocks are difficult to correlate over distances of greater than  m in drill core due to their inconsistencies in texture and thickness and the overprinting hydrothermal alteration it is not possible to correlate footwall tuff beds to surface exposures due to the accentuation of penetrative fabrics in these hydrothermally altered and oxidized rocks at surface within the drill core several units have distinctive mafic and felsic juvenile fragments and these units correlate for up to  m felsic dikes up to  m thick are present in drill core but comprise  percent of the footwall and hangingwall rocks these dikes have up to  percent feldspar quartz and biotite phenocrysts and are generally fine grained in the structural hanging wall to the west massive felsic flows and flow breccias are present at thicknesses of up to  m the bisha vms deposit is a single sheet of massive sulfide up to  m in thickness that has been folded and partly tipped along a northtrending steeply west strike and dipdipping axis the eastern lens is on the eastern limb of the fold while the western lenses are on the opposite western fold limb these two lenses are separated by erosion and surface oxidation processes however sulfide is continuous over the fold nose locally and oxidized material links them for several hundred meters in the central part of the deposit the surface expression of the northern half of the bisha deposit is manifested as important hematitegoethitequartz gossans up to  m wide and extending for tens to hundreds of meters the eastern lens is a nearly continuous sheet for over  km that faces west and dips ° to ° to the west some of the evidence for a westerly facing direction are primary eg below the oxidized zone massive sulfide is generally enriched in zinc to the west reflecting the common enrichment of zinc at the tops of massive sulfide lenses strong chlorite alteration and sulfide stringer mineralization in felsic tuffs are ubiquitous and strong to the east and much less plentiful west of the primary sulfide in the eastern lens at depth barium enrichment is much more common in the tuffs west of the primary sulfide of the eastern lens at depth the deepest drill holes in the southern half of the eastern lens have layered massive sulfide with high zinc contents and zinccopper ratios over two separate  to m intervals suggesting arranged massive sulfide lenses in this area the primary characteristics of the shallower western lenses are less clear due to nearsurface oxidation and their unusual geometry zinc has been largely removed from the sulfide and coper lead silver and gold are sporadically enriched by near surface supergene and oxidation processes a few deeper massive sulfide intersections in the western lenses have zinc enriched near the base of the lens evoking that the western lens faces east on the other side of an overturned synform from the eastern lens barium enrichment in tuffs consistently occurs at depth and east of the western lens but is generally absent to the west of the western lens this is consistent with barium disposition above the massive sulfide lens after massive sulfide formation and prior to deformation social responsibilityedit nevsun resources ltd has a corporate social responsibility program at the bisha mine and the company has been producing annual reports

asmara eritrea that is expected to produce gold silver copper and zinc over its year mine life the bisha property is a volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit with distinct layers of mineralization discovered in january  construction began in september  and the first gold was poured at the end of december  gold was the primary metal in the top layer and from the start of commercial production in late  until mid bisha produced goldsilver doré by mid the mine had worked through the goldsilver layer and was into the second layer of mineralization copper the copper facility achieved commercial production in december  the third layer of mineralization is copperzinc and commercial production of zinc is expected to start in  bisha’s mine area covers  km² the property comprises two mining licences covering an area of  km²  km² for bisha main and the northwest zones and  km² for harena and the  km² mogaraib river exploration license nevsun purchased the mogaraib river exploration license from ngex resources in  geologyedit the bisha depositedit the neoproterozoic bisha volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit vms is a large  million metric tons zinccoppersilvergold deposit in district in western eritrea the site comprises a large perhaps coeval and cogenetic intrusion known as the bisha gabbroic complex and s series of mafic to felsic tuffs with small flows and small sedimentary rocks in the proximal footwall and felsic flows fine tuffs and volcanicderived siliclastic rocks in the upsection the other two vms deposits are present along strike bisha northwest  km to northnorthwest and harena  km to the southsouthwest additionally a large lower grade vms deposit hambok is present about  km to the southwest the oxidation and supergene advancement have led to the development of four mineralogically and spatially distinct ore types or zones the hematitegoethitequartz gossan from  to m depth has high gold silver and lead contents with native gold argentiferous gold electrum anglesite and lesser cerussite the kaolinitequartzsulfate zone occurs at  to  m depth and also is enriched in gold silver and lead and has the same ore mineralogy as the gossan additionally it has minor chalcocite and minor to trace amounts of unusual zincleadiron carbonate and sulfate minerals the supergene sulfide zone is present from about  to  m in depth and has significant copper enrichment with predominantly chalcocite and lesser digenite covellite and bornite along with pyrite minor pyrrhotite anglesite and gangue minerals the primary massive sulfide from  to more than m depth has a noteworthy deposit of zincrich ore and a typical vms sulfide assemblage of pyrite sphalerite chalcopyrite and minor to trace galena pyrrhotite tetrahedrite tennantite arsenopyrite baryte and gangue deposit geologyedit the host rocks of the bisha deposit are for the most part felsic and intermediate lapilli ash and crystal fine to mediumgrained feldspar quartz biotite locally hornblende ash tuffs that are variably altered minor feldspar and quartfeldspar felsic flows and flow breccias are present only to the west of the deposit generally the volcanic host rocks are difficult to correlate over distances of greater than  m in drill core due to their inconsistencies in texture and thickness and the overprinting hydrothermal alteration it is not possible to correlate footwall tuff beds to surface exposures due to the accentuation of penetrative fabrics in these hydrothermally altered and oxidized rocks at surface within the drill core several units have distinctive mafic and felsic juvenile fragments and these units correlate for up to  m felsic dikes up to  m thick are present in drill core but comprise  percent of the footwall and hangingwall rocks these dikes have up to  percent feldspar quartz and biotite phenocrysts and are generally fine grained in the structural hanging wall to the west massive felsic flows and flow breccias are present at thicknesses of up to  m the bisha vms deposit is a single sheet of massive sulfide up to  m in thickness that has been folded and partly tipped along a northtrending steeply west strike and dipdipping axis the eastern lens is on the eastern limb of the fold while the western lenses are on the opposite western fold limb these two lenses are separated by erosion and surface oxidation processes however sulfide is continuous over the fold nose locally and oxidized material links them for several hundred meters in the central part of the deposit the surface expression of the northern half of the bisha deposit is manifested as important hematitegoethitequartz gossans up to  m wide and extending for tens to hundreds of meters the eastern lens is a nearly continuous sheet for over  km that faces west and dips ° to ° to the west some of the evidence for a westerly facing direction are primary eg below the oxidized zone massive sulfide is generally enriched in zinc to the west reflecting the common enrichment of zinc at the tops of massive sulfide lenses strong chlorite alteration and sulfide stringer mineralization in felsic tuffs are ubiquitous and strong to the east and much less plentiful west of the primary sulfide in the eastern lens at depth barium enrichment is much more common in the tuffs west of the primary sulfide of the eastern lens at depth the deepest drill holes in the southern half of the eastern lens have layered massive sulfide with high zinc contents and zinccopper ratios over two separate  to m intervals suggesting arranged massive sulfide lenses in this area the primary characteristics of the shallower western lenses are less clear due to nearsurface oxidation and their unusual geometry zinc has been largely removed from the sulfide and coper lead silver and gold are sporadically enriched by near surface supergene and oxidation processes a few deeper massive sulfide intersections in the western lenses have zinc enriched near the base of the lens evoking that the western lens faces east on the other side of an overturned synform from the eastern lens barium enrichment in tuffs consistently occurs at depth and east of the western lens but is generally absent to the west of the western lens this is consistent with barium disposition above the massive sulfide lens after massive sulfide formation and prior to deformation social responsibilityedit nevsun resources ltd has a corporate social responsibility program at the bisha mine and the company has been producing annual reports since  based on the global reporting initiative standards their program focuses on corporate governance employment and training of local eritreans land restoration health and safety and community the company’s corporate social responsibility priorities are based on annual materiality exercises with stakeholder consultation to determine annual priority areas some of the notable accomplishments since  have been no lost time injuries for  million man hours  of the employee base are local eritreans and  usd  million was spent on local procurement environmental reclamation is incorporated in the company’s ongoing operational activities versus addressing such issues during the mine closure planning the company indicated in its  csr report that it had rehabilitated approximately  ha of land of the  ha that have been disturbed since construction began in  in response to allegations of forced labour nevsun commissioned an independent human rights impact assessment in  and have shared the results of this study with stakeholders and requested input the company has committed to providing an update with respect to implementation of the study’s recommendations in q  human rights violationsedit in november  three former employees of the bisha mine filed a civil suit in british columbia against nevsun resources for complicity in torture forced labour slavery and crimes against humanity company ceo cliff davis responded saying we are confident that the allegations are unfounded based on various companyled and third party audits the bisha mine has adhered at all times to international standards of governance workplace conditions and health and safety we are committed to ensuring that the bisha mine is managed in a safe and responsible manner that respects the interests of local communities workers national governance stakeholders and the natural environment nevsun has previously received criticism from human rights watch for failing to exercise proper human rights duediligence when engaging with a country where forced labour is allegedly practiced a human rights watch report released in january  found that nevsun resources failed to take the risks of forced labour seriously and then struggled to address allegations of abuse connected to its company’s bisha mine in eritrea eritrea’s government maintains a “national service” program that conscripts eritreans into prolonged and indefinite terms of forced labor generally under abusive conditions it is through this forced labor program that mining companies run the most direct risk of involvement in the eritrean government’s

and a typical vms sulfide assemblage of pyrite sphalerite chalcopyrite and minor to trace galena pyrrhotite tetrahedrite tennantite arsenopyrite baryte and gangue deposit geologyedit the host rocks of the bisha deposit are for the most part felsic and intermediate lapilli ash and crystal fine to mediumgrained feldspar quartz biotite locally hornblende ash tuffs that are variably altered minor feldspar and quartfeldspar felsic flows and flow breccias are present only to the west of the deposit generally the volcanic host rocks are difficult to correlate over distances of greater than  m in drill core due to their inconsistencies in texture and thickness and the overprinting hydrothermal alteration it is not possible to correlate footwall tuff beds to surface exposures due to the accentuation of penetrative fabrics in these hydrothermally altered and oxidized rocks at surface within the drill core several units have distinctive mafic and felsic juvenile fragments and these units correlate for up to  m felsic dikes up to  m thick are present in drill core but comprise  percent of the footwall and hangingwall rocks these dikes have up to  percent feldspar quartz and biotite phenocrysts and are generally fine grained in the structural hanging wall to the west massive felsic flows and flow breccias are present at thicknesses of up to  m the bisha vms deposit is a single sheet of massive sulfide up to  m in thickness that has been folded and partly tipped along a northtrending steeply west strike and dipdipping axis the eastern lens is on the eastern limb of the fold while the western lenses are on the opposite western fold limb these two lenses are separated by erosion and surface oxidation processes however sulfide is continuous over the fold nose locally and oxidized material links them for several hundred meters in the central part of the deposit the surface expression of the northern half of the bisha deposit is manifested as important hematitegoethitequartz gossans up to  m wide and extending for tens to hundreds of meters the eastern lens is a nearly continuous sheet for over  km that faces west and dips ° to ° to the west some of the evidence for a westerly facing direction are primary eg below the oxidized zone massive sulfide is generally enriched in zinc to the west reflecting the common enrichment of zinc at the tops of massive sulfide lenses strong chlorite alteration and sulfide stringer mineralization in felsic tuffs are ubiquitous and strong to the east and much less plentiful west of the primary sulfide in the eastern lens at depth barium enrichment is much more common in the tuffs west of the primary sulfide of the eastern lens at depth the deepest drill holes in the southern half of the eastern lens have layered massive sulfide with high zinc contents and zinccopper ratios over two separate  to m intervals suggesting arranged massive sulfide lenses in this area the primary characteristics of the shallower western lenses are less clear due to nearsurface oxidation and their unusual geometry zinc has been largely removed from the sulfide and coper lead silver and gold are sporadically enriched by near surface supergene and oxidation processes a few deeper massive sulfide intersections in the western lenses have zinc enriched near the base of the lens evoking that the western lens faces east on the other side of an overturned synform from the eastern lens barium enrichment in tuffs consistently occurs at depth and east of the western lens but is generally absent to the west of the western lens this is consistent with barium disposition above the massive sulfide lens after massive sulfide formation and prior to deformation social responsibilityedit nevsun resources ltd has a corporate
