message photoofedwardcjohnsond dear shareholder through the first five months of  stock and bond markets experienced the kind of shortterm volatility that can affect them from time to time after climbing steadily upward for more than two years stock prices saw a sharp correction in late march and early april returns in the bond market were essentially stagnant as the federal reserve board implemented a longexpected increase in shortterm interest rates at the end of march while its impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with any degree of certainty there are certain basic principles that can help investors plan for their future needs first investors are encouraged to take a longterm view of their portfolios if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline we know from experience for example that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage your investing risk through diversification a stock mutual fund for instance is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification further by investing in a number of different stock funds or in such other investment categories as bonds if you have a short investment time horizon you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in highquality shortterm investments of course its important to remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of  per share and that these types of funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any agency of the us government finally no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio by doing so you wont get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising market nor will you buy all your shares at market highs while this strategy  known as dollar cost averaging  wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases remember to contact your investment professional if you need help with your investments best regards

income fund q bob how did the fund perform a for the six months ending may   the funds class a class t and class b shares returned   and  respectively for the past year the class a class t and class b shares returned   and  respectively the fund trailed the equity income funds average for the same time periods as tracked by lipper analytical services which was up  for six months and  for the year additionally the standard  poors  index was up  for six months and  for the year q why did the fund underperform the index a over the period the funds cash position was fairly high  between  and  of assets  which hurt returns since the fund wasnt fully invested in a rising market the large cash position was mostly the result of dramatic inflows of capital into the fund especially this past january following that inflow i made the decision to invest a portion of the proceeds in sp  futures i saw these lowrisk futures not as a market bet but as a place to get some market exposure on a temporary basis my goal going forward is to eliminate this position entirely i should point out that i am a value investor and i look hard at whether a stock is attractive on a valuation basis that is whether its cheap or expensive relative to its own history similar companies or its underlying assets i also invest for the long term as a result i tend to be cautious when the fund has large inflows of cash im not just going to throw this capital into equities instead ill wait to find value stocks with the potential for longterm success q were there any other reasons behind the funds underperformance compared to the index over the past six months a yes the fund underperformed the index because the index held more largecapitalization companies which the market favored over the period than the fund held i found value mostly in midcap stocks although i did hold a number of largecap stocks in my top  positions in addition the fund was hurt by holding fewer bank stocks than the average equityincome fund banks did very well over the period especially in january of  the funds fairly large sector weighting in finance at the end of the period    mostly represented its investments in nonbanks such as insurance companies q what were some investment decisions that paid off for the fund over the period a probably the funds bestperforming holdings were walmart and ibm which both turned in strong results over the period walmart one of the funds top holdings during the period was perhaps my favorite about three or four years ago it embarked on a strategy of converting its existing stores into superstores which have just about everything a consumer would want to buy including groceries this strategy set walmart up for future profits but was very expensive in the short run since it costs a tremendous amount to convert stores i invested in walmart early on in this strategy and this year that investment started paying off as these superstores continued to mature q what about ibm a top  stock ibm was another solid holding new management has come in and helped generate tremendous cash flow which has been used in part to repurchase one in every seven shares outstanding i got into ibm very early in this process when its stock was inexpensive and my research showed that there was a favorable riskreward ratio this meant that the potential downside of the stock was much lower than the potential upside q you noted earlier that you are a value investor were there some stocks that you considered real value stocks over the period a yes clearly i thought walmart and ibm were value stocks another good example was top  holding philip morris philip morris did very well and had steady earnings and cash flow over the period the problem is that its a tobacco company facing litigation this kept its valuation low when you buy a wellestablished fortune  stock at this value price you know theres some risk involved however my research showed me that the stocks potential reward was higher than its potential risk so the riskreward ratio was still good another value company was masco which makes faucets and kitchen cabinets it has been undervalued due to some past strategy errors but its core business has been profitable throughout recent history in addition the chairman who is paid a cash salary of only  a year but has a stock option for a million shares if he reaches the companys goals has a strong incentive to profitably grow the company q did you have any regrets over the period a sure as i mentioned earlier i wish i had invested less of the fund in cash over the period i am actively working to minimize or reduce this position q bob how does the fund look going forward a i am positioning the fund to provide reasonable returns with low volatility and risk going forward i have some concerns because valuation levels look quite high so i expect that there will be fewer positive riskreward opportunities available however if the economy continues on its steady path of slow moderate growth i think the overall market outlook is pretty bright the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions fund facts goal seeks to maintain a yield that exceeds the composite dividend of the sp  while considering the potential for achieving capital appreciation start date april   size as of may   more than  billion manager robert chow since  joined fidelity in  checkmark bob chow on the goals of the fund the goal of the fund is longterm capital appreciation achieved in a context of low risk this entails several things such as low volatility and low fund turnover the funds average holding time is three years which is very consistent with my longterm investment approach part of the way i work toward the funds goals is to strongly consider the risk reward ratio which ive discussed in this report in fact the first question i ask when im considering a stock is whats the downside after ive determined the downside i need to make sure the reward is higher this fund is not trying to catch a fast bang from the market but is positioned for the longterm investment changes top ten stocks as of may    of funds  of funds investments investments in

message photoofedwardcjohnsond dear shareholder through the first five months of  stock and bond markets experienced the kind of shortterm volatility that can affect them from time to time after climbing steadily upward for more than two years stock prices saw a sharp correction in late march and early april returns in the bond market were essentially stagnant as the federal reserve board implemented a longexpected increase in shortterm interest rates at the end of march while its impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with any degree of certainty there are certain basic principles that can help investors plan for their future needs first investors are encouraged to take a longterm view of their portfolios if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline we know from experience for example that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage your investing risk through diversification a stock mutual fund for instance is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification further by investing in a number of different stock funds or in such other investment categories as bonds if you have a short investment time horizon you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in highquality shortterm investments of course its important to remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of  per share and that these types of funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any agency of the us government finally no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio by doing so you wont get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising market nor will you buy all your shares at market highs while this strategy  known as dollar cost averaging  wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases remember to contact your investment professional if you need help with your investments best regards edward c johnson d advisor equity income fund  institutional class performance the bottom line there are several ways to evaluate historical performance you can look at the total percentage change in

have grown to   a  increase on the initial investment for comparison look at how the sp  did over the same period with dividends reinvested the same  investment would have grown to   a  increase understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow the stock market for example has a history of longterm growth and shortterm volatility in turn the share price and return of a fund that invests in stocks will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money but if you can ride out the markets ups and downs you may have a gain checkmark fund talk the managers overview an interview with robert chow portfolio manager of fidelity advisor equity income fund q bob how did the fund perform a for the six month and oneyear periods ending may   the funds institutional class shares returned  and  respectively for the same time periods the equity income funds average as tracked by lipper analytical services was  and  additionally the standard  poors  index was up  for six months and  for the year q why did the fund underperform the index a over the period the funds cash position was fairly high  between  and  of assets  which hurt returns since the fund wasnt fully invested in a rising market the large cash position was mostly the result of dramatic inflows of capital into the fund especially this past january following that inflow i made the decision to invest a portion of the proceeds in sp  futures i saw these lowrisk futures not as a market bet but as a place to get some market exposure on a temporary basis my goal going forward is to eliminate this position entirely i should point out that i am a value investor and i look hard at whether a stock is attractive on a valuation basis that is whether its cheap or expensive relative to its own history similar companies or its underlying assets i also invest for the long term as a result i tend to be cautious when the fund has large inflows of cash im not just going to throw this capital into equities instead ill wait to find value stocks with the potential for longterm success q were there any other reasons behind the funds underperformance compared to the index over the past six months a yes the fund underperformed the index because the index held more largecapitalization companies which the market favored over the period than the fund held i found value mostly in midcap stocks although i did hold a number of largecap stocks in my top  positions in addition the fund was hurt by holding fewer bank stocks than the average equityincome fund banks did very well over the period especially in january of  the funds fairly large sector weighting in finance at the end of the period    mostly represented its investments in nonbanks such as insurance companies q what were some investment decisions that paid off for the fund over the period a probably the funds bestperforming holdings were walmart and ibm which both turned in strong results over the period walmart one of the funds top holdings during the period was perhaps my favorite about three or four years ago it embarked on a strategy of converting its existing stores into superstores which have just about everything a consumer would want to buy including groceries this strategy set walmart up for future profits but was very expensive in the short run since it costs a tremendous amount to convert stores i invested in walmart early on in this strategy and this year that investment started paying off as these superstores continued to mature q what about ibm a top  stock ibm was another solid holding new management has come in and helped generate tremendous cash flow which has been used in part to repurchase one in every seven shares outstanding i got into ibm very early in this process when its stock was inexpensive and my research showed that there was a favorable riskreward ratio this meant that the potential downside of the stock was much lower than the potential upside q you noted earlier that you are a value investor were there some stocks that you considered real value stocks over the period a yes clearly i thought walmart and ibm were value stocks another good example was top  holding philip morris philip morris did very well and had steady earnings and cash flow over the period the problem is that its a tobacco company facing litigation this kept its valuation low when you buy a wellestablished fortune  stock at this value price you know theres some risk involved however my research showed me that the stocks potential reward was higher than its potential risk so the riskreward ratio was still good another value company was masco which makes faucets and kitchen cabinets it has been undervalued due to some past strategy errors but its core business has been profitable throughout recent history in addition the chairman who is paid a cash salary of only  a year but has a stock option for a million shares if he reaches the companys goals has a strong incentive to profitably grow the company q did you have any regrets over the period a sure as i mentioned earlier i wish i had invested less of the fund in cash over the period i am actively working to minimize or reduce this position q bob how does the fund look going forward a i am positioning the fund to provide reasonable returns with low volatility and risk going forward i have some concerns because valuation levels look quite high so i expect that there will be fewer positive riskreward opportunities available however if the economy continues on its steady path of slow moderate growth i think the overall market outlook is pretty bright the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions fund facts goal seeks to maintain a yield that exceeds the composite dividend of the sp  while considering the potential for achieving capital appreciation start date april   size as of may   more than  billion manager robert chow since  joined fidelity in  checkmark bob chow on the goals of the fund the goal of the fund is longterm capital appreciation achieved in a context of low risk this entails several things such as low volatility and low fund turnover the funds average holding time is three years which is very consistent with my longterm investment approach part of the way i work toward the funds goals is to strongly consider the risk reward ratio which ive discussed in this report in fact the first question i ask when im considering a stock is whats the downside after ive determined the downside i need to make sure the reward is higher this fund is not trying to catch a fast bang from the market but is positioned for the longterm investment changes top ten stocks as of may    of funds  of funds investments investments in
