humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by

quality management philosophy – six sigma product quality is of vital importance to innovative solutions and support and its customers we have taken steps to enhance the overall quality of our products we utilize the six sigma program which is a process evaluation program based on the premise that efficient companies can reduce to a very low level the number of defects and inefficient processes under this program we are continuously seeking to improve our operational efficiencies including our design and manufacturing processes and thus the general quality of our products in particular our six sigma program allows us to analyze our development processes and reduce the risks inherent in shortening our development cycle times iso as iss is iso  and as revision c certified by the independent registrar dekra certification inc for both design and manufacturing our goal is to ensure that we can consistently deliver our products and related services in a manner that meets or exceeds customer quality requirements as an iso as certified manufacturer we can represent to our customers that we maintain high quality industry standards in the education of our employees and the design and manufacture of our products our products undergo extensive quality control testing prior to being delivered to customers as part of our quality assurance procedures we maintain detailed records of test results and our quality control processes variability reduction efforts innovative solutions and support is well versed in the philosophy that variation causes defects before year  the majority of our smt printed wiring assemblies were outsourced as part of our growth and knowledge in trying to control and reduce variability iss made significant capital expenditures to bring surface mount technology smt capabilities inhouse rather than be at the mercy of our subassembly subcontractors this investment resulted in a significant reduction of solder joint defects along with a significant cycle time reduction the overall quality and reliability of our products have been improved by bringing this technology inhouse variation can be attributed to a lack of understanding the process therefore iss takes employee training seriously we have  participation in electrostatic discharge esd and hazardous communication hazcom training iss currently has manufacturing and inspection personnel trained to the requirements of ipca acceptability of electronic assemblies and jstd requirements for soldered electrical and electronic assemblies we have internal iso as auditors departmental training is on going to ensure awareness to iso work instructions faa and customer relationships the boeing company has approved our quality management system to bqms d appendix a and
