was incorporated as light tech inc under the laws of the state of nevada on may   a subsidiary in the name westcott products corporation was organized by us under the laws of the state of delaware on june   for the purpose of changing our name and domicile to the state of delaware on june   we merged with the delaware subsidiary with the survivor being westcott products corporation a delaware corporation   all of our prior operations were conducted through lee building products and t a kilgore  company kilgore which owned and operated a home center in league city texas about  miles southeast of downtown houston texas during  we ceased all operations and the secured lenders took possession of all of its assets on march   our board of directors began the process of reentering the development stage with the appointment of new officers and directors and began the process of seeking the acquisition of new business opportunities these efforts resulted in the completion of the acquisition of dala petroleum corp a nevada corporation dala a transaction that is more specifically described below on june   westcott products corp a delaware corporation westcott its newly formed and whollyowned subsidiary dala acquisition corp a nevada corporation merger subsidiary and dala petroleum corp a nevada corporation dala executed and delivered an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement and all required or necessary documentation to complete the merger collectively the transaction documents whereby merger subsidiary merged with and into dala and dala was the surviving company under the merger and became a whollyowned subsidiary of westcott on the closing of the merger the merger  effective june   the respective boards of directors of westcott and dala along with westcott as the sole stockholder of merger subsidiary and dalas sole stockholder chisholm partners ii llc a louisiana limited liability company chisholm ii owning  of the outstanding voting securities of dala approved the merger by written consent and the articles of merger were filed with the secretary of state of the state of nevada on such date which was the effective date of the merger  accordingly westcott issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of dala to dala petroleums sole shareholder following the receipt of the  shares chisholm iis managing director approved the transfer of all of the shares to its members or its members designees on a pro rata basis the transfer of shares to the members of chisholm ii occurred on june   several conditions precedent as set forth in the merger agreement were completed prior to the merger one critical condition precedent set forth in the merger agreement is that westcott would raise no less than  the minimum offering from persons who are accredited investors in consideration of the issuance or the conversion of a minimum of  shares up to a maximum of  shares of its series a  convertible preferred stock at the offering price of  per unit upon the closing of the offering the company sold  units in the offering raising  on august   the company filed a certificate of amendment of certificate of incorporation with the state of delaware changing the name of the company to dala petroleum corp as approved by a majority of the common shareholders and  of the preferred shareholders dala possesses rights to engage in oil and natural gas exploration and development in north central kansas with total acreage of approximately  acres the property since the time of the merger dala is operating as an earlystage oil exploration company focused on the property which has oil potential at depths of less than  feet dala was assigned the rights to explore the property from chisholm partners ii llc chisholm ii an exploration and production company focused on the acquisition of kansas oil leasehold interests and exploration and development and dalas sole shareholder prior to the merger into the company since may  dala has temporarily suspended its exploration program due to the decline in the price of oil and difficult market conditions during the year ended september   the company did not drill any wells dala has established a land position over a shallow conventional oil play in north central kansas  the play or exploration concept is located across a four county area and is geographically defined by the boundaries of the productive north american rift system  the land position is concentrated over a lightly explored portion of the rift bordered immediately on the south by productive riftrelated oil fields and to the north by significant new discoveries in southeast nebraska where productive rates have recently been reported  this play concept was developed by a team of highly experienced international geologists geophysicists and land experts who applied regional geologic theory proprietary geophysical databases and high resolution seismic the company entered into a partial cancellation agreement the pca by and among its subsidiary dala petroleum corp a nevada corporation dala nv chisholm partners ii llc a louisiana limited liability company chisholm ii and certain members of chisholm ii the chisholm members through which chisholm ii after receiving shares from certain of its chisholm members returned a total of  shares of the company common stock to the companys treasury for cancellation  in exchange for the return of these shares for cancellation the company assigned  acres of the companys property rights approximately  of its total holdings to chisholm ii  pursuant to terms of the pca on may   the  shares of common stock delivered by chisholm ii were cancelled on the books and records of the company prior to that company delivered  acres of its leased property to chisholm ii on may   as approved by the board of directors of the company as part of the settlement with the preferred shareholders the company filed an amended and restated certificate of designation of the companys series a  convertible preferred stock the cod which i changed the conversion price of the preferred stock from  per share to  per share and ii eliminated section  certain adjustments of the cod pursuant to terms of the pca on july   the  shares of common stock delivered after the initial closing by baldo sanso  shares of common stock robert sali  shares of common stock and chris dabbs  shares of common stock were cancelled on the books and records of the company the reduction was offset to additional paidin capital chisholm ii elected to waive receipt of any additional properties due to it under the pca on may   the company terminated the master services agreement with chisholm ii and all amounts due thereunder were released by chisholm ii our principal offices are located at  barry ave s  wayzata mn   our telephone number is  our fiscal yearend is september  except as otherwise indicated as used throughout the remainder of this annual report references to company westcott we us or our refer to we us and our refer to dala petroleum corp formerly known as westcott products corporation a delaware corporation from and after june   and dala petroleum corp a nevada corporation prior to june   since its inception on january   now the companys operating subsidiary business strategy our business strategy is to create value for our shareholders by establishing and growing reserves production and cash flow on a costefficient basis  due to the significant decline in the market price of oil the company has temporarily suspended all exploration activities  upon reactivation key elements of our business strategy will include · development and exploration of our existing oil and gas leases in the north american rift system if we begin the development of our current acreage position in the property we will be required to register as a licensed oil and gas operator within the state of kansas · to selectively participate on a nonoperated basis in seismicallydriven prospects that correspond geologically with our existing footprint within the state of kansas · prudent management of our current limited cash resources · to complement our organic growth strategy we will seek to aggregate any future production in order to accelerate the companys production and reserve profile · retaining qualified personnel to carry out the companys growth strategy and · evaluating potential merger or financing options industry operating environment the oil and natural gas industry is affected by many factors that we generally cannot control government regulations particularly in the areas of taxation energy climate change and the environment can have a significant impact on operations and profitability  significant factors that will impact oil prices in the current fiscal year and future periods include political and social developments in the middle east demand in asian and european markets and the extent to which members of opec and other oil exporting nations manage oil supply through export quotas or lack thereof  additionally natural gas prices continue to be under pressure due to concerns over excess supply of natural gas due to the high productivity of emerging shale developments in the united states and continued lower product demand caused by a weakened economy  natural gas prices are generally determined by north american supply and demand and are also affected by imports of liquefied natural gas  weather also has a significant impact on demand for natural gas since it is a primary heating source development upon an acceptable recovery in the market price of oil we will primarily engage in oil and natural gas exploration and production on the property using a technical exploration team to further explore and develop the property dala has an inventory of drillready oil prospects   most of the prospects are supported by modern seismic data and are a combination of field extensions step out locations and offsets to existing production during the year ended september   the company drilled zero wells  the wells drilled had no commercial quantities of oil and were plugged and abandoned  dala established a land position over a shallow conventional oil play in north central kansas  the play or exploration concept is located across a four county area and is geographically defined by the boundaries of the productive north american rift system  the land position is concentrated over a lightly explored portion of the rift bordered immediately on the south by productive riftrelated oil fields and to the north by significant new discoveries in southeast nebraska where productive rates have recently been reported  this play concept was developed by a team of highly experienced international geologists geophysicists and land experts who applied regional geologic theory proprietary geophysical databases and high resolution seismic click to enlarge competition the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we will be competing with numerous other oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  most of these companies have substantially greater resources than we have  not only do they explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also many carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis  the operations of other companies will be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties  they will also have substantially more resources to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our limited financial or human resources permit our larger or integrated competitors will have the resources to be better able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which will adversely affect our competitive position  our ability to discover reserves and acquire additional properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability and resources to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment  in addition we will be at a disadvantage in producing oil and natural gas properties and bidding for exploratory prospects because we have substantially fewer financial and human resources than other companies in our industry  should a larger and betterfinanced company decide to directly compete with us and be successful in its efforts our business model and any business operations could be adversely affected marketing and customers the market for oil and natural gas that may be produced from our properties depends on factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities demand for oil and natural gas the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulation the oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial commercial and individual consumers the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since midyear  reflecting robust nonopec supply growth led by expanding unconventional production in the united states weakening growth in emerging markets and the decision by opec to maintain its current production ceiling the downturn in the price of crude oil has impacted and depending upon its duration will continue to significantly impact the companys operations and ability to raise funds or attract potential partners the company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance however the timing of any such increases is unknown  our oil production if any is expected to be sold at prices tied to the spot oil markets  our natural gas production if any is expected to be sold under shortterm contracts and priced based on first of the month index prices or on daily spot market prices  we will rely on any operating partners to market and sell our production where we contract with such operators in drilling prospects  we currently have a suspended management services agreement with chisholm ii and an option participation agreement with chisholm ii principal agreements affecting our ordinary business we do not own any physical real estate but instead our acreage is comprised of leasehold interests subject to the terms and provisions of lease agreements that provide us the right to explore and develop the property in specific geographic areas all lease arrangements that comprise our current acreage positions are established using industrystandard terms that have been established and used in the oil and natural gas industry for many years and our leases are with the state of kansas all of our current leases were assigned to us by chisholm ii our majority shareholder that obtained the original leasehold interest prior to the assignment on june   we entered into a master services agreement with chisholm pursuant to the master service agreement chisholm agreed to act as an independent contractor for the company and provide services and personnel to develop drill operate and maintain oil and gas wells and properties used to produce oil and gas within the state of kansas for a period of twelve  months as of may   the company terminated the master services agreement and all amounts due thereunder were released by chisholm ii any options to participate in future chisholm ii projects was thereby terminated as well in general our current lease agreements have a term of five years from the effective date with an option to extend for an additional three years the effective dates of the leases vary lease to lease the oldest effective date is october   and the most recent effective date is march   lease agreements comprising approximately  acres are currently possessed by the company royalty rates will be negotiated on a casebycase basis consistent with industry standard pricing once a well is drilled and production established the leased acreage in the applicable spacing unit is customarily considered developed acreage and is held by production other locations within the drilling unit created for a well may also be drilled at any time with no time limit as long as the lease is held by production governmental regulation and environmental matters our operations are subject to various rules regulations and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as a whole regulation of oil and natural gas production oil and natural gas exploration production and related operations when developed are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal state tribal and local authorities and agencies  for example kansas requires permits for drilling operations drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and imposes other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas  kansas may also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells and the regulation of spacing plugging and abandonment of such wells  failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties  the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability  although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws  significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations environmental matters our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and relating to safety and health the recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards and this trend will likely continue these laws and regulations may · require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities · limit or prohibit construction drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas and · impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from such operations the permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation modification and renewal by issuing authorities  governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations and violations are subject to fines or injunctions or both  in the opinion of management we anticipate that we will be in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements nevertheless changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on us as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and comparable state statutes impose strict joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who have disposed of or have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment  the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance although cercla currently excludes petroleum from its definition of hazardous substance state laws affecting our operations may impose cleanup liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products in addition although rcra classifies certain oil field wastes as nonhazardous such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements the endangered species act esa seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal fish and plant species nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species  under esa exploration and production operations as well as actions by federal agencies may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat  esa provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of esa  other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include but are not necessarily limited to the fish and wildlife coordination act the fishery conservation and management act the migratory bird treaty act and the national historic preservation act  although we believe that our operations will be in substantial compliance with such statutes any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject us directly or indirectly through any operating partners to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force discontinuation of certain operations altogether on april   epa finalized rules proposed on july   which establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epas rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds vocs and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the rules establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment in addition the rules revise leak detection requirements for natural gas processing plants these rules may require a number of modifications to our planned operations and those of any of our potential thirdparty operating partners including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from compressors although we cannot predict the cost to comply with these new requirements at this point compliance with these new rules could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business these new regulations and proposals and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment could have a material adverse impact on our business model and business results of operations and financial condition the federal water pollution control act of  or the clean water act the cwa imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of produced waters and other pollutants into navigable waters permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands the cwa and certain state regulations prohibit the discharge of produced water sand drilling fluids drill cuttings sediment and certain other substances related to the oil and gas industry into certain coastal and offshore waters without an individual or general national pollutant discharge elimination system discharge permit in addition the clean water act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater andor developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans the cwa and comparable state statutes provide for civil criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release the underground injection of oil and natural gas wastes are regulated by the underground injection control program authorized by the safe drinking water act  the primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water  all of leased acreage in which we have interest may be required to be developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process  hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate gas production  legislation to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process were proposed in recent sessions of congress the us congress continues to consider legislation to amend the safe drinking water act to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to regulation under the acts underground injection control program to require disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways  the federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturings potential impact  several states including kansas where our current leased properties are located have also proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing we cannot predict whether any other legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be  if additional levels of regulation and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level it could lead to delays increased operating costs and process prohibitions that would materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations  the national environmental policy act or nepa establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection maintenance and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies  a major federal agency action having the potential to significantly impact the environment requires review under nepa  many of our planned activities and those of any of our potential thirdparty operating partners are covered under categorical exclusions which results in a shorter nepa review process  the council on environmental quality has announced an intention to reinvigorate nepa reviews and on march   issued final guidance that may result in longer review processes that could lead to delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations climate change significant studies and research have been devoted to climate change and global warming and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the united states and globally  certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment recent scientific research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration and production in the united states legislative and regulatory initiatives are underway to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us congress has considered legislation that would control ghg emissions through a cap and trade program and several states have already implemented programs to reduce ghg emissions  the us supreme court determined that ghg emissions fall within the federal clean air act or the caa definition of an air pollutant and in response the epa promulgated an endangerment finding paving the way for regulation of ghg emissions under the caa in  the epa issued a final rule known as the tailoring rule that makes certain large stationary sources and modification projects subject to permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act in addition in september  the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghgs from specified large ghg emission sources in the united states beginning in  for emissions in   on november   the epa published a final rule expanding its existing ghg emissions reporting to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas systems beginning in  we and any of our potential third party operating partners are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions under these rules  because regulation of ghg emissions is relatively new further regulatory legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur  such developments may affect how these ghg initiatives will impact us  moreover while the us supreme court held in its june  decision american electric power co v connecticut that with respect to claims concerning ghg emissions the federal common law of nuisance was displaced by the federal clean air act the court left open the question of whether tort claims against sources of ghg emissions alleging property damage may proceed under state common law  there thus remains some litigation risk for such claims  due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with ghg emissions we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on us legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy  to the extent that our products are competing with higher greenhouse gas emitting energy sources our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions  to the extent that our products are competing with lower greenhouse gas emitting energy sources such as solar and wind our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions we cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations the majority of scientific studies on climate change suggest that stronger storms may occur in the future in the areas where we operate although the scientific studies are not unanimous  although operators may take steps to mitigate physical risks from storms no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on our business existing and probable government regulation to our current and intended business smaller reporting company we are subject to the reporting requirements of section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of

we have one whollyowned operating subsidiary dala petroleum corp incorporated in nevada competitive business conditions and smaller reporting companys competitive position in the industry and methods of competition the oil and natural gas industry is very competitive and the company competes with numerous other oil and gas exploration and production companies numerous independent oil and gas companies oil and gas syndicates and major oil and gas companies actively seek out and bid for oil and gas properties as well as for the services of third party providers such as drilling companies upon which we rely a substantial number of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial and personnel resources than we do and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles some of our competitors not only explore for produce and market petroleum and natural gas but also carry out refining operations and market the resultant products on a

together with all of the other information included in this report before making an investment decision if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment you should read the section entitled special note regarding forward looking statements above for a discussion of what types of statements are forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this report oil and gas price fluctuations in the market may adversely affect the results of our operations our profitability cash flows and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent upon the market prices of oil and natural gas substantially all of our sales of oil and natural gas if any are made in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices and not pursuant to longterm fixedprice contracts  accordingly the prices received for our oil and natural gas production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control these factors include the level of consumer product demand governmental regulations and taxes the price and availability of alternative fuels the level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas and the overall economic environment historically the oil and natural gas markets have proven cyclical and volatile as a result of factors that are beyond our control  any additional declines in oil and natural gas prices or any other unfavorable market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those reserves most likely will vary from our estimates estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex the process relies on interpretations of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of · the quality and quantity of available data · the interpretation of that data · the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and · the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate estimates of proved reserves prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates  actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes development expenditures and operating expenses most likely will vary from our estimates  any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves  in addition we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history results of exploration and development and prevailing oil and gas prices our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties  our operations will require significant expenditures of capital that may not be recovered we will require significant expenditures of capital in order to locate and develop producing properties and to drill exploratory and exploitation wells  in conducting exploration exploitation and development activities from a particular well the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations miscalculations or accidents may cause our exploration exploitation development and production activities to be unsuccessful potentially resulting in abandonment of the well  this could result in a total loss of our investment  in addition the cost and timing of drilling completing and operating wells is difficult to predict compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations our operations will be subject to numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection  any properties we might own for the exploration and production of oil and gas and the wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the oil pollution act of  the resource conservation and recovery act the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws  under such laws we could be required to remove or remediate previously released wastes or property contamination  laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and may in some cases impose strict liability for environmental damage  strict liability means that we may be held liable for damage without regard to whether we were negligent or otherwise at fault  environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed  failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative civil and criminal penalties although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with existing requirements of governmental bodies our ability to conduct continued operations is subject to satisfying applicable regulatory and permitting controls our current permits and authorizations and ability to get future permits and authorizations may be susceptible on a going forward basis to increased scrutiny greater complexity resulting in increased costs or delays in receiving appropriate authorizations we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights and changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations because of the speculative nature of oil and gas exploration there is risk that we will not find commercially exploitable oil and gas and that our business will fail the search for commercial quantities of oil and natural gas as a business is extremely risky we cannot provide investors with any assurance that any properties in which we obtain a mineral interest will contain commercially exploitable quantities of oil andor gas  the exploration expenditures to be made by us may not result in the discovery of commercial quantities of oil andor gas  problems such as unusual or unexpected formations or pressures premature declines of reservoirs invasion of water into producing formations and other conditions involved in oil and gas exploration often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts if we are unable to find commercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas andor we are unable to commercially extract such quantities we may be forced to abandon or curtail our business plan and as a result any investment in us may become worthless we may not produce any oil or gas we are an exploratory company and we may not actually discover or produce any oil or gas additionally our leases may expire before we are able to complete any additional exploration or discover or produce any oil or gas the oil and gas we produce may not be readily marketable at the time of production crude oil natural gas condensate and other oil and gas products are generally sold to other oil and gas companies government agencies and other industries  the availability of ready markets for oil and gas that we might discover and the prices obtained for such oil and gas depend on many factors beyond our control including · the extent of local production and imports of oil and gas · the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities · fluctuating demand for oil and gas · the marketing of competitive fuels and · the effects of governmental regulation of oil and gas production and sales natural gas associated with oil production is often not marketable due to demand or transportation limitations and is often flared at the producing well site  pipeline facilities do not exist in certain areas of exploration and therefore we intend on utilizing trucks to transport any oil that is discovered  the price of oil and natural gas has historically been volatile  if it were to decrease substantially our projections budgets and revenues would be adversely affected potentially forcing us to make changes in our operations our future financial condition results of operations and the carrying value of any oil and natural gas interests we acquire will depend primarily upon the prices paid for oil and natural gas production oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and likely will continue to be volatile in the future especially given current world geopolitical conditions our cash flows from operations are highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas this price volatility also affects the amount of our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital the prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include · the level of consumer demand for oil and natural gas · the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas · the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls · the price of foreign oil and natural gas · domestic governmental regulations and taxes · the price and availability of alternative fuel sources · weather conditions · market uncertainty due to political conditions in oil and natural gas producing regions including the middle east and · worldwide economic conditions these factors as well as the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty declines in oil and natural gas prices affect our revenues and could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  accordingly such declines could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties if the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines we may be unable to make planned expenditures among other things if this were to happen we may be forced to abandon or curtail our business operations which would cause the value of an investment in us to decline in value or become worthless because of the inherent dangers involved in oil and gas operations there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages as we conduct our business operations which could force us to expend a substantial amount of money in connection with litigation andor a settlement the oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts pipe failures casing collapse explosions uncontrollable flows of oil natural gas or well fluids fires spills pollution releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks these hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to us from among other things injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property purchased and leased by us as a result substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred the payment of which could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration development or acquisitions or result in the loss of our properties andor force us to expend substantial monies in connection with litigation or settlements we currently have no insurance to cover such losses and liabilities and even if insurance is obtained there can be no assurance that it will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we cannot predict the availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify our purchase the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations we may elect to selfinsure if management believes that the cost of insurance although available is excessive relative to the risks presented in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations which could lead to any investment in us becoming worthless we may encounter operating hazards that may result in substantial losses we will be subject to operating hazards normally associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas including hurricanes blowouts explosions oil spills cratering pollution earthquakes labor disruptions and fires  the occurrence of any such operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life and damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells formations production facilities or other properties  we maintain insurance coverage limiting financial loss resulting from certain of these operating hazards  we do not maintain full insurance coverage for all matters that may adversely affect our operations including war terrorism nuclear reactions government fines treatment of waste blowout expenses wind damage and business interruptions  losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events could reduce our revenues or increase our costs there can be no assurance that any insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities associated with operational hazards  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance or its availability at premium levels that justify its purchase  we face strong competition from larger oil and gas companies which could result in adverse effects on our business the exploration and production business is highly competitive  many of our competitors have substantially larger financial resources staffs and facilities  our competitors in the united states include numerous major oil and gas exploration and production companies  additionally other companies engaged in our line of business may compete with us from time to time in obtaining capital from investors  competitors include larger companies which in particular may have access to greater resources may be more successful in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and may conduct their own refining and petroleum marketing operations which may give them a competitive advantage  actual or potential competitors may be strengthened through the acquisition of additional assets and interests  additionally there are numerous companies focusing their resources on creating fuels andor materials which serve the same purpose as oil and gas but are manufactured from renewable resources our estimates of the volume of reserves could have flaws or such reserves could turn out not to be commercially extractable as a result our future revenues and projections could be incorrect estimates of reserves and of future net revenues prepared by different petroleum engineers may vary substantially depending in part on the assumptions made and may be subject to adjustment either up or down in the future our actual amounts of production revenue taxes development expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from the estimates  oil and gas reserve estimates are necessarily inexact and involve matters of subjective engineering judgment in addition any estimates of our future net revenues and the present value thereof are based on assumptions derived in part from historical price and cost information which may not reflect current and future values andor other assumptions made by us that only represent our best estimates if these estimates of quantities prices and costs prove inaccurate we may be unsuccessful in expanding our oil and gas reserves base with our acquisitions additionally if declines in and instability of oil and gas prices occur then write downs in the capitalized costs associated with any oil and gas assets we obtain may be required because of the nature of the estimates of our reserves and estimates in general we can provide no assurance that reductions to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves and estimated future net revenues will not be required in the future andor that our estimated reserves will be present andor commercially extractable if our reserve estimates are incorrect the value of our common stock could decrease and we may be forced to write down the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties our business will suffer if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary licenses our operations will require licenses permits and in some cases renewals of licenses and permits from various governmental authorities our ability to obtain sustain or renew such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to change in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable governments among other factors  our inability to obtain or our loss of or denial of extension of any of these licenses or permits could hamper our ability to produce revenues from our operations our operations are subject to various litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business from time to time we may become a defendant in various litigation matters  the nature of our operations exposes us to further possible litigation claims in the future  there is risk that any matter in litigation could be adversely decided against us regardless of our belief opinion and position which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  litigation is highly costly and the costs associated with defending litigation could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change the growing political and scientific sentiment is that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns  changing weather patterns along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could impact the availability or increase the cost to produce our products  additionally the sale of our products can be impacted by weather conditions concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting the greenhouse gas emissions  for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the territories we operate  laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our oil and gas production could impact our business and financial results if oil or natural gas prices decrease or drilling efforts are unsuccessful we may be required to record writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties we could be required to write down the carrying value of certain of our oil and natural gas properties  writedowns may occur when oil and natural gas prices are low or if we have downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves increases in our estimates of operating or development costs deterioration in drilling results or mechanical problems with wells where the cost to redrill or repair is not supported by the expected economics  accounting rules require that the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties be periodically reviewed for possible impairment  under the full cost method of accounting capitalized oil and natural gas property costs less accumulated depletion net of deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling amount equal to the present value discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves plus the cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization without regard to estimates of fair value or estimated fair value if lower of unproved properties that are subject to amortization should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling which is tested on a quarterly basis an impairment is recognized  while an impairment charge reflects our longterm ability to recover an investment reduces our reported earnings and increases our leverage ratios it does not impact cash or cash flow from operating activities our future success depends on our ability to replace reserves that are produced because the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted our future success depends upon our ability to economically find or acquire and produce additional oil and natural gas reserves except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced future oil and natural gas production therefore is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable we cannot assure you that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost we may acquire significant amounts of unproved property to further our development efforts development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we may acquire both proved and producing properties as well as undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance growth potential and increase our earnings over time however we cannot assure you that all of these properties will contain economically viable reserves or that we will not abandon our initial investments  additionally we cannot assure you that unproved reserves or undeveloped acreage that we acquire will be profitably developed that new wells drilled on our properties will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investments in our properties and reserves our lack of industry and geographical diversification may increase the risk of an investment in our company we operate exclusively in the oil and gas sector and our leases in are north central kansas this lack of geographic diversification may make our holdings more sensitive to economic developments within a regional area which may result in reduced rates of return or higher rates of default than might be incurred with a company that is more geographically diverse our business depends on oil and natural gas transportation and processing facilities and other assets that are owned by third parties the marketability of our oil and natural gas depends in part on the availability proximity and capacity of pipeline systems processing facilities oil trucking fleets and rail transportation assets owned by third parties  the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities whether as a result of proration physical damage scheduled maintenance or other reasons could result in the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties  the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established or operations are commenced on units containing the acreage or the leases are extended none of our acreage is currently held by production or held by operations  unless production in paying quantities is established or operations are commenced on units containing these leases during their terms the leases will expire if our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases we will lose our right to develop the related properties the loss of our management team upon whose knowledge relationships with industry participants leadership and technical expertise we rely could diminish our ability to conduct our operations and harm our ability to execute our business plan our success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of the members of our management team whose knowledge relationships with industry participants leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace  in particular our ability to successfully acquire additional properties to increase our reserves to participate in drilling opportunities and to identify and enter into commercial arrangements depends on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants  in addition our ability to select and evaluate suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment is dependent on our management teams knowledge and expertise in the industry  to continue to develop our business we rely on our management teams knowledge and expertise in the industry and will use our management teams relationships with industry participants specifically those of our board of directors to enter into strategic relationships which may take the form of joint ventures with other private parties and contractual arrangements with other oil and natural gas companies  deficiencies of title to our leased interests could significantly affect our financial condition we typically incur the expense of a title examination prior to acquiring oil and natural gas leases or undivided interests in oil and natural gas leases or other developed rights if an examination of the title history of a property reveals that an oil or natural gas lease or other developed rights have been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the mineral interest desired our interest would substantially decline in value or be eliminated in such cases the amount paid for such oil or natural gas lease or leases or other developed rights may be lost risks related to our securities and our organization our stock price may be volatile which may result in losses to our shareholders the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations and the market prices of companies listed on the overthecounter markets quotation system in which shares of our common stock are listed have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors including the following some of which are beyond our control · variations in our operating results · changes in expectations of our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors · changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry · additions or departures of key personnel and · future sales of our common stock domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance may adversely affect the price of our common stock our common shares may become thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all we cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for trading our common stock will be sustained this situation is attributable to a number of factors including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts stock brokers institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume  even if we came to the attention of such persons those persons tend to be riskaverse and may be reluctant to follow purchase or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable as a consequence there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or nonexistent as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price we cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained or that current trading levels will be sustained the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small company which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price you may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all which may result in substantial losses to you shareholders should be aware that according to sec release no  the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse such patterns include  control of the market for the security by one or a few brokerdealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer  manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases  boiler room practices involving highpressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons  excessive and undisclosed bidask differential and markups by selling brokerdealers and  the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and brokerdealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of brokerdealers who participate in the market management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities the occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price because the sec imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in shares of penny stocks some brokers may be unwilling to trade our securities this means that you may have difficulty reselling your shares which may cause the value of your investment to decline our shares are classified as penny stocks and are covered by section g of the exchange act which imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokersdealers who sell our securities for sales of our securities brokerdealers must make a special suitability determination and receive a written agreement prior from you to making a sale on your behalf because of the imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices it is possible that brokerdealers will not want to make a market in our common stock this could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the value of your investment to decline  financial industry regulatory authority finra sales practice requirements may limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock which could depress the price of our shares finra rules require brokerdealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer prior to recommending speculative lowpriced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status tax status and investment objectives among other things under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability such speculative lowpriced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers thus finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares have an adverse effect on the market for our shares and thereby depress our share price volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation the market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future in the past plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we may in the future be the target of similar litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert managements attention and resources our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance internal control and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and finra have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of  our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities because new and modified laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices as our internal controls are currently ineffective our business and future prospects may suffer we will incur increased costs and compliance risks as a result of being a public company we will incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements we also anticipate that we will incur costs associated with adopted corporate governance requirements including certain requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  as well as new rules implemented by the sec otc markets and finra  we expect these rules and regulations in particular section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly like many smaller public companies we face a significant impact from required compliance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  section  requires management of public companies to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls and the evaluation performed by management the sec has adopted rules implementing section  for public companies as well as disclosure requirements the public company accounting oversight board or pcaob has adopted documentation and attestation standards that the independent auditors must follow in conducting its attestation under section  we are currently preparing for compliance with section  however there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively meet all of the requirements of section  as currently known to us in the currently mandated timeframe any failure to implement effectively new or improved internal controls or to resolve difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations or result in management being required to give a qualified assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or our independent auditors providing an adverse opinion regarding managements assessment any such result could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price we also expect these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs  sales of our currently issued and outstanding stock may become freely tradable pursuant to rule  and may dilute the market for your shares and have a depressive effect on the price of the shares of our common stock a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock are restricted securities within the meaning of rule  under the securities act of  as amended the securities act rule  as restricted shares these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of rule  or other applicable exemptions from registration under the securities act and as required under applicable state securities laws rule  provides in essence that one year following a company

week rule does not apply to companies quoted on the otcqb pursuant to rule  shareholders must wait at least one year from the date of our filing of a form k with requisite form  information to avail themselves of rule  unless we file a registration statement for the sale of such shares prior thereto the company did file a registration statement on form s registering  shares of common stock of the company a sale under rule  or under any other exemption from the securities act if available or pursuant to subsequent registrations of our shares may dilute the market and have a depressive effect on the price of the shares of our common stock our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements we may be unable to continue to operate without the threat of liquidation for the foreseeable future our report from our independent registered public accounting firm issued in connection with the audited financial statements of our company for the last fiscal period includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern because the company is in the exploration stage and accordingly has not yet generated revenues from operations  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock and ultimately the achievement of significant operating revenues failure to obtain additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our business operations these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty risks of penny stock our companys common stock may be deemed to be penny stock as that term is defined in section a­ of the exchange act penny stocks are stocks i with a price of less than five dollars per share ; ii that are not traded on a  recognized  national exchange ; iii whose prices are not quoted on the nasdaq automated quotation system nasdaq­listed stocks must still meet requirement i above ; or iv in issuers with net tangible assets less than  if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at

and exchange commission require broker­dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investors account potential investors in our companys common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be penny stock  moreover rule g­ of the securities and exchange commission requires broker­dealers in penny stocks to approve the

less market liquidity for the common stock  need for any governmental approval of principal products of services we are subject to all governmental approval requirements for an oil and gas exploration company the oil exploration industry is a highlyregulated industry and the company will need to obtain certain government approvals for its operations including a license as an operator in the state of kansas once the company begins to operate the wells on the leases of the property we will be required to attract and retain top quality talent to compete in the marketplace we believe our future growth and success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial operational and finance personnel  there can be no assurance of success in attracting and retaining such personnel  shortages in qualified personnel could limit our ability to drill for oil and continue the exploration of the property we will be subject to evolving and expensive corporate

business as a publicly traded company we are subject to various federal state and other rules and regulations including applicable requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of   compliance with these

to established controls and procedures may make it difficult for us to ensure that the objectives of the control system are met  a failure of our controls and procedures to detect other than

and capital resources as of september   we have  in cash and cash equivalents on hand currently the company obtains cash for operating expenses through methods of financings primarily the issuance of convertible preferred shares of stock for cash and the issuance of debt securities the company anticipates future losses in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern  the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future andor obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due  management intends to finance operating costs over the next  months with existing cash on hand and issuance of equity securities  there is no assurance funds will continue to be available through these methods of financing operations until the company begin generating

dependent on debt and equity financing to support our operations  in addition to our net losses for the period of  we have experienced negative cash flows from operations of  and have an accumulated deficit of  these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in order to obtain capital we may need to sell additional shares of our common stock preferred stock or debt securities or borrow funds from private lenders or banking institutions there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding in the amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if we are unable to raise additional funding as necessary we may have to suspend our operations temporarily or cease operations entirely plan of operation our revenues and future profitability are substantially dependent on our ability to raise additional funds we have suspended drilling and other exploration and development operations until the market conditions related to the price of oil have improved  we have substantially cut administrative expenses to conserve to conserve cash  the management and directors are no longer paid any salary or bonus  we also are not immediately planning any other leasing activity in our areas of operation  we continue to search for a financial andor operational partner to assist in developing our oil and gas properties  if we were to partner with another entity we would consider all options in developing our properties offbalance sheet arrangements we had no offbalance sheet arrangements during the year ended september   critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the amortization period for intangible assets valuation and impairment valuation of intangible assets depreciable lives of the web site and property and equipment valuation of warrant and beneficial conversion feature debt discounts valuation of sharebased payments and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets derivatives the company evaluates its convertible debt options warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for the result of this accounting treatment is that under certain circumstances the fair value of the derivative is markedtomarket each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability in the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or expense upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under this accounting standard are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date impairment of longlived assets the company accounts for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets this statement requires that longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  fair value of financial instruments and fair value measurements the company measures their financial assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for certain of our financial instruments including cash accounts payable accrued expenses escrow liability and shortterm loans the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities we have adopted accounting guidance for financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or liquidity this standard defines fair value provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures this standard does not require any new fair value measurements but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements this guidance does not apply to measurements related to sharebased payments this guidance discusses valuation techniques such as the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost the guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels the following is a brief description of those three levels level  observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active level  unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us which reflect those that a market participant would use oil and natural gas properties the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations set by regulation sx rule  whereby all costs related to the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are initially capitalized into a single cost center full cost pool such costs include land acquisition costs a portion of employee salaries related to property development geological and geophysical expenses carrying charges on nonproducing properties costs of drilling directly related to acquisition and exploration activities internal salaries are capitalized based on employee time allocated to the acquisition of leaseholds and development of oil and natural gas properties the company did not capitalize interest for the period ended september   proceeds from property sales will generally be credited to the full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized unless such a sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved reserves attributable to these costs there were no sales or gains or losses during the period presented the company assesses all items classified as unproved property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to depletion and amortization  the costs of drilling exploratory dry holes are included in the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is dry capitalized costs associated with impaired properties and properties having proved reserves estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  are depleted and amortized on the unitofproduction method based on the estimated gross proved reserves the costs of unproved properties are withheld from the depletion base until such time as they are developed impaired or abandoned under the full cost method of accounting capitalized oil and natural gas property costs less accumulated depletion net of deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling amount equal to the present value discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves plus the cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization without regard to estimates of fair value or estimated fair value if lower of unproved properties that are subject to amortization should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling which is tested on a quarterly basis an impairment is recognized the present value of estimated future net revenues is computed by applying prices based on a month unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect on the first day of each month less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions less any applicable future taxes revenue recognition the company recognizes oil and natural gas revenues from our interests in producing wells when production is delivered to and title has transferred to the purchaser and to the extent the selling price is reasonably determinable  the company uses the sales method of accounting for balancing of natural gas production and would recognize a liability if the existing proven reserves were not adequate to cover the current imbalance situation asset retirement obligation asset retirement obligation aro reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement removal site reclamation and similar activities associated with the companys oil and natural gas properties inherent in the fair value calculation of the aro are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts inflation factors credit adjusted discount rates timing of settlement and changes in the legal regulatory environmental and political environments   as of september   the company had no outstanding obligations related to aro liability stockbased compensation the company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in asc  which requires the company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards this requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fairvaluebased method the company recognizes the cost of all sharebased awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award the company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with asc  and the conclusions reached by the asc  costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by asc  income taxes the company follows asc topic  for recording the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period if available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods deferred taxes are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse the company applies a morelikelythannot recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties asc topic  only allows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities as of september   the company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding or retroactive tax positions with less than a  likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the company loss per share the company follows asc topic  to account for the loss per share basic loss per common share calculations are determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share calculations are determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during periods when common stock equivalents if any are antidilutive they are not considered in the computation  as the company has incurred losses for the period ended september   the potentially dilutive shares totaling  are antidilutive and are thus not added into the loss per share calculations  due to the antidilutive impact the weighted average dilutive shares outstanding for the period ended september   for basic and dilutive shares are the same recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  asu no  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective the new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december    early application is not permitted the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method the company is evaluating the effect that asu  will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures the company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting  in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  asu no  which eliminated the definition of a development stage entity and the related reporting requirements asu no  is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption allowed  in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information on the statements of income cash flows and shareholders equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage  the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein and early adoption is required the company chose to adopt asu no  early effective in its financial statements for the period ended september   in august  the fasb issued accounting standard update no  asu no  presentation of financial statements going concern subtopic  which requires management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards specifically asu  provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued it also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of managements plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated asu no  is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   early application is permitted we are currently evaluating the accounting implication and do not believe the adoption of asu  to have material impact on our consolidated financial statements although there may be additional disclosures upon adoption the company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a significant effect on the companys financial statement item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the price of oil and natural gas has historically been volatile if it were to decrease substantially our projections budgets and revenues would be adversely affected potentially forcing us to make changes in our operations our future financial condition results of operations and the carrying value of any oil and natural gas interests we acquire will depend primarily upon the prices paid for oil and natural gas production oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and likely will continue to be volatile in the future especially given current world geopolitical conditions our cash flows from operations are highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas this price volatility also affects the amount of our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital the prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include · the level of consumer demand for oil and natural gas · the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas · the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls · the price of foreign oil and natural gas · domestic governmental regulations and taxes · the price and availability of alternative fuel sources · weather conditions · market uncertainty due to political conditions in oil and natural gas producing regions including the middle east and · worldwide economic conditions · worldwide economic conditions these factors as well as the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty declines in oil and natural gas prices affect our revenues and could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically accordingly such declines could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties if the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines we may be unable to make planned expenditures among other things if this were to happen we may be forced to abandon or curtail our business operations which would cause the value of an investment in us to decline in value or become worthless  item   financial statements and supplementary data dala

financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america as discussed above in note  the company merged with dala petroleum corp a nevada corporation dala on june   the merger   dala is focused on the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas resources in the united states  prior to the merger westcott was considered a shell company as defined in sec rule b  for financial reporting purposes the merger represents a reverse merger rather than a business combination consequently the assets and liabilities and the operations that are reflected in the historical financial statements are those of dala immediately following the consummation of the reverse merger use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the amortization period for intangible assets valuation and impairment valuation of intangible assets allowance for accounts receivable depreciable lives of the web site valuation of warrants and beneficial conversion feature debt discounts valuation of derivatives and valuation of sharebased payments accounting for derivatives the company evaluates its convertible debt options warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for the result of this accounting treatment is that under certain circumstances the fair value of the derivative is markedtomarket each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability in the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or expense upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under this accounting standard are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date impairment of longlived assets the company accounts for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets this statement requires that longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell the company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for certain of our financial instruments including cash accounts payable accrued expenses deposits received from customers for layaway sales and short term loans the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities we follow accounting guidance for financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities this standard defines fair value provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures this standard does not require any new fair value measurements but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements this guidance does not apply to measurements related to sharebased payments this guidance discusses valuation techniques such as the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost the guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels the following is a brief description of those three levels level  observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  dala petroleum corp notes to consolidated financial

operations whereby all costs related to the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are initially capitalized into a single cost center full cost pool such costs include land acquisition costs a portion of employee salaries related to property development geological and geophysical expenses carrying charges on nonproducing properties costs of drilling directly related to acquisition and exploration activities internal salaries are capitalized based on employee time allocated to the acquisition of leaseholds and development of oil and natural gas properties the company did not capitalize interest for the period ended september   as it was not required proceeds from property sales will generally be credited to the full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized unless such a sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved reserves attributable to these costs  dala petroleum corp notes to consolidated financial statements september   the company assesses all items classified as unproved property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to depletion and amortization  the costs of drilling exploratory dry holes are included in the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is dry capitalized costs associated with impaired properties and properties having proven reserves estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  are depleted and amortized on the unitofproduction method based on the estimated gross proved reserves  the costs of unproved properties are withheld from the depletion base until such time as they are developed impaired or abandoned under the full cost method of accounting capitalized oil and natural gas property costs less accumulated depletion net of deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling amount equal to the present value discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves plus the cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization without regard to estimates of fair value or estimated fair value if lower of unproved properties that are subject to amortization should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling which is tested on a quarterly basis an impairment is recognized the present value of estimated future net revenues is computed by applying prices based on a month unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect on the first day of each month less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions less any applicable future taxes  if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling the company will record a writedown to the extent of such excess as a noncash charge to earnings  any such writedown will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in a lower depreciation depletion and amortization rate in future periods  a writedown may not be reversed in future periods even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling in april  the company participated in the completion of a well in which the company owns a  nonoperated working interest targeting the simpson and viola formations kansas that well was determined to be dry in june  during the year ended september   the company incurred total  in oil and natural gas expenditures as of september   the companys oil and natural gas properties were determined to be impaired thereby reducing the unproved oil and natural gas properties to   no additional impairment was realized for the year ended september   on may   the company entered into a partial cancellation agreement the pca by and among its subsidiary dala petroleum corp a nevada corporation dala nv chisholm ii and certain members of chisholm ii the chisholm members through which chisholm ii after receiving shares from certain of chisholm members returned a total of  shares of the companys common stock to the companys treasury for cancellation  in exchange for the return of these shares for cancellation the company returned  acres of the companys property rights held in the form of oil and gas leases from chisholm ii approximately  of its total holdings to chisholm ii revenue recognition the company recognizes oil and natural gas revenues from our interests in producing wells when production is delivered to and title has transferred to the purchaser and to the extent the selling price is reasonably determinable the company uses the sales method of accounting for balancing of natural gas production and would recognize a liability if the existing proven reserves were not adequate to cover the current imbalance situation as of the year ending september   no revenue has been recognized as all wells are still unproved and nonproducing asset retirement obligation asset retirement obligation aro reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement removal site reclamation and similar activities associated with the companys oil and natural gas properties inherent in the fair value calculation of the aro are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts inflation factors credit adjusted discount rates timing of settlement and changes in the legal regulatory environmental and political environments   as of september   the company had no aro liability as no wells have been established  dala petroleum corp notes to consolidated financial statements september   stockbased compensation the company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in asc  which requires the company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards this requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fairvaluebased method the company recognizes the cost of all sharebased awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award the company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with asc  and the conclusions reached by the asc  costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by asc  income taxes the company follows asc topic  for recording the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period if available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods deferred taxes are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse the company applies a morelikelythannot recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties asc topic  only allows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities as of september   the company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding or retroactive tax positions with less than a  likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the company net loss per share the company follows asc topic  to account for the loss per share basic loss per common share calculations are determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share calculations are determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during periods when common stock equivalents if any are antidilutive they are not considered in the computation  as the company has incurred losses for the period ended september   the potentially dilutive shares totaling  are antidilutive and are thus not added into the loss per share calculations  due to the antidilutive impact the weighted average dilutive shares outstanding for the period ended september   for basic and dilutive shares are the same segment information in accordance with the provisions of asc  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information the company is required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments the company does not have any operating segments as of september   and  effect of recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  asu no  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective the new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december    early application is not permitted the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method the company is evaluating the effect that asu  will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures the company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting  dala petroleum corp notes to consolidated financial statements september   in august  the fasb issued asu no   presentation of financial statements topic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern  the guidance requires management to perform an evaluation each annual and interim reporting period of whether there are conditions or events considered in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within the oneyear period after the date that the financial statements are issued if such conditions are identified the guidance requires an entity to provide certain disclosures about the principal conditions or events that gave rise to the substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern managements evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entitys ability to meet its obligations and managements plans to alleviate or mitigate substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern the guidance is effective for the first annual period ending after december   and interim periods thereafter the company currently does not expect the adoption of asu  to have a material impact on its financial statements and does not anticipate early adoption of this pronouncement the company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a significant effect on the companys financial statement note   going concern the company has not generated any revenues has recurring net losses a working capital deficiency as of september   of  and used cash in operations of  and  for the years ended september   and  respectively in addition as of september   the company had an accumulated deficit and stockholders deficiency of  and  respectively these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us gaap which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the ability of the company to continue its operations is dependent on the execution of managements plans which include the raising of capital through the debt andor equity markets until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements if the company were not to continue as a going concern it would likely not be able to realize its assets at values comparable to the carrying value or the fair value estimates reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in generating additional cash from the equitydebt markets or other sources to be used for operations the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary based on the companys current resources the company will not be able to continue to operate without additional immediate funding should the company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations the company would need to curtail certain or all operational activities andor contemplate the sale of its assets if necessary the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern the company is attempting to commence explorations and generate revenue however the companys future cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations  while the company believes in the viability of its strategy in the exploration and development of its unproved properties and the companys ability to raise additional funds until such time it is able to generate sufficient revenue to support its operations there can be no assurances to that effect  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and in its ability to raise additional funds until such time the company can generate sufficient revenues to support its operations in the event the company is unable to raise funding in the near term we will not be able to pay our liabilities in the event we are unable to raise adequate funding in the future for our operations and to pay our outstanding debt obligations and if our current creditors elect to foreclose on the outstanding debts then owed we would be forced to liquidate our assets or may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection which could result in the value of our outstanding securities declining in value or becoming worthless the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary

reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af and df under the exchange act internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the ceo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records which in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the companys assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in evaluating the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of september   management used the criteria established in the internal control  integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on the criteria established by coso management with the participation of the ceo identified the following material weaknesses in the companys internal control over financial reporting as of september   which arose from the limited number of number of staff at the company and the inability to achieve proper segregation of duties · the company lacked effective controls for ensuring the accuracy of reporting over significant account balances including the review approval and documentation of related transactions and account reconciliations and other complex accounting procedures · the company lacked effective controls because their directors are not independent as a result of these material weaknesses management concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of september   based on the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework  issued by coso this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting  managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the security and exchange commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report changes in internal control over financial reporting there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter of our fiscal year ended september    limitations on the effectiveness of controls the companys management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met further the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time
