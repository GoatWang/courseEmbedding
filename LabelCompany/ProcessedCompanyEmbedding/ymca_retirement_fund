either a church or is associated with and shares common religious bonds with churches or associations of churches on december   president george w bush signed a bill into law which clarified that plans of the ymca retirement fund are church plans print   how is the ymca retirement fund different from other retirement plans as an administrator of church plans the fund can offer retirement income accounts commingle assets for investment purposes and provide annuities without paying an insurance company church plans also provide the annuities themselves at a better rate and lower cost this is one of the primary benefits of a church plan and provides a much better benefit to employees in addition the retirement plan and the savings plan have a unique plan design unlike a typical k retirement account retirement savings at the ymca retirement fund are protected during stormy economic times as a result of this unique structure of the plans not once in the funds year history have account balances ever gone down   print   is the money in the fund insured by the federal government the ymca retirement fund’s plans like defined contribution plans ks bs etc are not insured by the government print   is money saved in the fund safe yes the safety of the fund is in its highly diversified portfolio managed by professionals and a dedicated board of trustees not once in the history of the fund have account balances ever gone down nor have annuity payments ever been missed the fund’s plans are designed in such a way that minimizes the risk of investment loss to the participant print   what is erisa and does the ymca retirement plan follow the erisa rules the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa was passed to protect employee pensions in response to some spectacular company failures in the s most notably the studebaker automobile company they had failed to put aside sufficient money to pay pensions if they went out of business and when they did all their retirees lost their pensions this federal law requires certain standards for participation enrollment vesting and benefit payments it also requires that the people who manage a pension plan fiduciaries meet certain standards the law generally classifies pension plans into three groups company plans government plans and church plans there are different rules for each of these it also classifies plans as defined benefit formula or defined contribution individual account plans created before erisa was enacted may not fall clearly into one of these categories although church pension plans are not subject to erisa the ymca retirement plan elected to become subject to erisa in connection with the  legislation confirming its status as a church pension plan print   who reviews the funds operation the funds financial statements are audited annually by an independent cpa firm the fund reports to the new york state department of financial services viewed by many as the toughest state insurance department in the country the fund also reports to the irs and the department of labor print   what is the interest rate for  at the november   meeting of the funds board of trustees
