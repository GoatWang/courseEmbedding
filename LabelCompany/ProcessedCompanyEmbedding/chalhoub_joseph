untapped potential   the group’s research in the middle east has found that   the number of highnetworth individuals in the region and their wealth is actually increasing with numbers set to grow by

business environment is more formally defined and framed by regulation addressing governance labour laws and consumer protection the region has one of the highest rates of luxury brand penetration in the world the region is displaying a maturing retail environment in terms of expanding available retail space and the variety of shopping environments the emergence of digital in the luxury retail sector in the gulf means that traditional marketing and the conventional instore retail experience are being upended luxury consumers are evolving and now seek more experientialfocused consumption

level nurtures innovation to create marketrelevant and compelling shopping experiences – for example chalhoub group’s unique concept store level shoes in dubai mall which delivers a revolutionary immersive shoe experience across sqm   patrick chalhoub coceo chalhoub group commented the gulf region has witnessed a period of abundance for the past  years with the building of incredible infrastructure and the development of the education of its young and vibrant population   it is now entering a new phase of maturity of knowledge of seriousness and of stronger governance despite the
