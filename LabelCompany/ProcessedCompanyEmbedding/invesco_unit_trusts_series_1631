performance is no guarantee of future results actual returns will vary from hypothetical strategy returns due to timing differences and because the trust may not be invested equally in all stocks or be fully invested at all times in any given year the strategy may lose money or underperform the index returns are calculated by taking yearend prices subtracting them from the prices at the end of the following year adjusting for any stock splits that might have occurred during the year and adding dividends received for the period divided by starting price average annual total return and total return measure change in the value of an investment plus dividends assuming quarterly reinvestment of dividends average annual total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects aggregate change and is not annualized standard deviation is a measure of volatility that represents the degree to which an investments performance has varied from its average performance over a particular period standard deviation does not compare the volatility of an investment relative to other investments or the overall stock market the more an investments return varies from the investments average return the more volatile the investment standard deviation is based on past performance and is no guarantee of future results please keep in mind that high doubledigit andor
