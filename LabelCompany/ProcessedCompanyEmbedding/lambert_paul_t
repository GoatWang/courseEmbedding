it didnt score high enough seems like they arent running a scam if it was a scam wouldnt they accept every idea because weither or not it had any potential to become an actual product wouldnt matter if it was a scam theyd accept every idea because theyre making money off of you and not off of the idea since your invention scored too low why would you be interested in paying more money to them to push your idea reply reply  th of apr  by   georgia  votes it seems to me that lambert  lambert invent is a good company they have an a rating with the better business bureau and are professional

after they give your invention a  in the end stay away reply reply  th of oct  by   nattinut  votes why hasnt lambert  lambert replied to this blog reply reply  th of oct  by   nunyabusyness  votes their website states very plainly that the fee is for evaluation only and they dont promise to take every invention submitted to them you got what you paid for which was a report come up with another idea or use that report to help write a business plan to get funding to build the company yourself although based on your grammar and spelling i would hire someone else to write that business plan reply reply  st of dec  by   inventor  votes i have  to  ideas and i was about to contact lamber  lamber but im glad i found this site it seems that every invention company are a bunch of greeddy people and is very sad for people with great ideas that sooner or later these ideas die along with your dreams reply reply  th of dec  by   lambertinvent  best advice  votes my name is trevor lambert and i am the president and founder of lambert  lambert inc unfortunately since we signed a nondisclosureconfidentiality agreement with barbara when she submitted i can not speak on the specific merits of her invention  which admittedly poses a challenge when dealing with her complaint in this public forum nevertheless let me just say that any neutral party who reviewed her invention when looking over our market research would see that the product lacked commercial feasibility clearly she misunderstood our process for whatever reason which led to this complaint reading our website anyone can see that we represent inventors on contingency only after we perform an evaluation that focuses on the licensability of the invention our research consists of competitive analysis on existing products in the marketplace a patent search and  other criteria key to a successful product yes that evaluation has a fee of  yet considering a patent search alone usually costs  with most service providers i think you will see the value and understand we are not getting rich off of evaluations rather our evaluation process provides a system by which we can consider new products for representation utilizing scientific methodology further i would like to assure the visitors to this site that our company continues to represent inventors and successfully license inventions on their behalf should you need reassurance on the legitimacy of our company which has been in business nearly a decade let me just site the following about our company  member of the better business bureau with an a rating  professional member of the united inventors association  official good guy by the national inventor fraud center  member of the minnesota inventors congress finally i personally am a member of the licensing executives society i speak at inventor organizations such as the inventors network i completed a book invent secrets and have had articles published  most recently one was published in the inventors digest and just this month i was elected to the board of directors for the united inventors association if this doesnt convince you that we are a legitimate company i invite you to call us and speak with some of my staff or visit our offices for a facetoface meeting i understand that this industry is filled with sharks yet i assure you we are not one of them in the end we continue to have a nominal fee for the evaluation and work on contingency thereafter instead of charging inventors    like our competitors yes we turn down inventions that we feel wont be successful but i would rather remain honest and tell inventors what i really think about their invention rather than fill them with hope to get them to spend thousands on their invention all my best trevor reply reply  th of dec  by   paul s  votes i recently sent my idea to lambert  lambert and so far they seem to be nothing but complete profesionals i understand they need to evaluate my product and make a decision on weather its marketable all ideas are not good ideas why wouldnt they jump on idea if its o good one it would be more profit for them if you dont like there response go another direction try  prove them wrong sour grapes taste awfultry try again paul cleveland oh reply reply  th of jan  by   pat shields  votes i am thinking about submitting my idea to lambert and lambert to me my idea is the best thing that has been thought of since the wheel i want to let you all know one thing the excitement and energy that this idea gives me is just as important to me as getting it to market and seing it on shelves at the sporting goods store however i know that it is what it is just an idea like all ideas some are good some not so good every inventor that has ever thought of a product has thought the same thing this is going to be a glod mine this my friends is not the case i would estimate that  in  ideas become a reality knowing the latter i still have confidance in my product so if i lose  because the evaluation system they use says my product is not good enough then they saved me alot of money other companies out there would have stolen one such company i contacted wanted  for the same thing lambert and lambert is going to do for oo sugestion donot be so blinded by your idea and see it for what it is just an idea your puppy and we all want our puppies to grow int dogs but reality tells us that dont always happen if your idea did not work for you i will sell you mine for  grand pshields maryland reply reply  st of jan  by   kdip  votes i am glad lambert responded i was just reading the  paragraph contract or as they call it legal disclosure and information i received from patent assistance worldwide which shares a page with a box for your credit card information so that i can pay the  oo they are going to charge me for what works out to be their opinion however the bbb has given them a b even if i didnt think they were scammers which i do i would definitely rather pay  than the former and because i am on an extremely limited budget right now im still going to shop around and take my time to make sure my invention makes it to the next round id like to see one of those rejection reports it seems like that would be a valuable tool in this process better luck next time barb cheers reply reply  th of feb  by   ricoh calahan  votes i decided to go forward with patent assistance worldwide i received a full patent search with an attached leagal opinion from a registered patent attorney a great market analysis covering  factors that may affect my idea and a very detailed graphic illustration of my idea all this was put in a produt guide that outlined everything about my idea good work very happy the same attorney filed a patten application for me and was very good at explaining the process to me in detail i have an offer for my idea but i want to wait for global licensing partners to find me a better one seems you didnt really use this company they are great reply reply  th of feb  by   new inventor  votes i have been dealing with other promotion companies you propably guess who and have to be fair to lambert and lambert they are much cheaper and saw some of their reports compared to other companies are far better we also have to be fair that some inventions are totally useless and have no market but lambert and lambert from the above info seems to reject to go any further and suck money from people unlike other companies who they are aware the product is useless and yet they charge people extortionate amont of hard earned money cheers bh reply reply  rd of feb  by   techgal  votes ive been working with patent assistance worldwide and my inventionidea passed their review boardthey seem reputable to me though they do have a b with the bbb ive spoken with ip watchdog and they know nothing negative at least about them the ftc and the attorney generals office in miami fl doesnt seem to have any complaints with them and they work on a contingency fee basis that is more than fair to the inventor so ill let you know how it turns out they want my invention ready for the june tradeshow here in las vegas its at the mandalay bay casino and its called the licensee tradeshow if i remember rightgood luck to all inventors and check out gene quinn and ip watchdog its a great site to learn from for sure reply reply  th of mar  by   cpreston  votes im wondering how it went with working with patent assistance worldwide im also pursuing an idea with them right now i have already paid the up front  for all the info they are just waiting for me to pay the next almost  and they will go ahead and pass me on to global licensing partners to help me sell my idea please help me know if they are just a scam i cant afford to throw money away reply reply  rd of mar  by   katerina  votes if you got a slightly more technical invention forget these guys they seem to be only able to handle simple gadgets used for infomercials to be perfectly blunt just look at the success stories and you be the judge reply reply  rd of mar  by   katerina  votes also they lie about the review time big time reply reply  th of apr  by   foota  votes whats the actual review time for patent assistance worldwide seriously has anyone used both patent assistance worldwide and lambert  lambert to comment on which is more legitimate i would really like to know so i dont wast time or money thanks reply reply  th of apr  by   new inventor  votes best thing now a days is if you have invented something small and not so complicated you can find yourself someone to draw it for you in d cad then use d printer to produce your prototype then submit your patent documents and take it to china and produce in large quantity hope this helps could save people a small fortune please let me know if you find this useful thanks new inventor reply reply  th of apr  by   foota  votes is it true that patent assistance worldwide does not charge an consultant fee for reviewing your invention because i would not want to send something to them and then get caught i rather do that with lambertlambert since they are much more recognised and acredited by the way new inventer i like your idea very much but sadly to date i dont have the funds to go that route so i still have to look for investors awaiting your response reply reply  th of

does your business have a bad reputation fix it the right way corporate advocacy program™ seo reputation management at its best i submitted my invention to ll in january it is now august and i have yet to receive any evaluations or any other type of paperwork to date i am always told they sent it but would resend it how many times do you think it would take for them to get it right after many apologies for months now i still actually wait for what they promised in the mail due to their continuing errors and lack of response i was allowed to submit another idea free of charge now dont you think its ridiculous for anyone to be treated as such especially for a company that supposedly has good reviews well thats all about to change i believe i have been lied to tremendously and am not going to put up with it anymore many conversations and false promises dont believe all those testimonials either other companies can at least back up theirs with real people now trevor should know from experience how it feels to have ones livelihood messed with or taken for the biggest bs ride of their life shame on you i dont know how you even sleep nights i am getting better response elsewhere and frankly dont think ll deserve up to  of my royalties since they are anything but professional i dont care if trevor goes to trade shows etcmaybe go back to school if you cant deal with anything more technical than a simple gadget if you cant handle it then admit it thats a word from the wise dont make people believe youre something youre not btw the supposed evaluation of at least the first invention was positive and passed the second one has been in their hands now for about  months frankly i dont trust it in their hands and will now be demanding not only a refund but will be seeking other avenues with these guys i think  months of emotional distress is bad enough but now they cant even do alone what they had promised on their website for instance you now would pay an additional  for special designs on a program called enhance something of which they said they do hmmmmm i smell a rat here or how about a website through them which is another small fee now i realize that might still be reasonable but when it goes from doing it all to now recruiting other companies to help it only means to me you were never really qualified to begin with the bbb will get a detailed report from me also this will also be posted wherever possible including fb to help others follow up information will also be posted in closing although i dont think ive said enough i have been very very patient with these guys and always treated them respectfully until just recently the breaking point was after  days following our last conversation i still have not received what they yet again said they sent this was to be the review i never received and paperwork to be signed now i think ive been patient enough dont you  months of lies and bs i guess i have learned to be careful

is what separates good businesses from bad businesses arbitrate remove reports no better yet arbitrate to set the record straight rebuttals  replies author consumer employeeowner updates  rebuttals  rebuttal owner of company representing inventors author trevor lambert  united states of america submitted sunday november   posted sunday november   dear sir or madam my name is trevor lambert and i am the president of lambert  lambert inc  as is shown in the thread on this complaint it has been retracted by the person who posted it since we never performed an evaluation for the inventor as for the allegation that we do not accept inventions for license representation and only supply negative reports that is patently false  in fact we are always proactively representing inventors and licensing products on their behalf  just in the past couple months we have several new items hitting walmart bed bath and beyond and lowes one of which is an infomercial product in the end web communication is very impersonal and so i would encourage you to give us a call or better yet visit our office to meet our staff  we hope to hear from you all my best trevor trevor lambert president lambert  lambert inc respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment lambert and lambert customer ripoff author tg  united states of america submitted thursday september   posted thursday september   if you want to waste  and you time go ahead and submit your invention  look at other customers ll always gives a rating below their standard to invest your product  look at how many people that they supposedly helped  dont do it and i say this because i care  they get hundreds of inventions a day at  bucks a pop to send an email that says you didnt make the cut respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  rebuttal owner of company inventor fabricated complaint author trevor lambert  united states of america submitted monday february   posted monday february   i would like to notify those who read this post that i have contacted jpaul directly with the email below since i respect that he would like to remain anonymous to those reading ive deleted anything that would reveal his identity as the saying goes sunlight is the best disinfectantand in that spirit and since he has chosen to make this very public my hope is to provide complete transparency regarding this complaint and let the reader decide for themselves dear inventors name as you know ive replied to your complaint posted at website address after extensive research into all of our submissions since january all that we have record of is that you were sent the signed nondisclosure agreements and submission forms on january   thus far we have no record of a formal submission in which a payment was made on your behalf for an evaluation ive taken the liberty of researching you and i came across your published patent application xxxxxxxxx for a description of invention yet nothing correlates with a formal submission to lambert  lambert further in speaking with my staff that handles phone calls and emails they have no record of any communication from you prior to your complaint postings throughout the internet in all my business dealings i try to give the benefit of the doubt to the inventor and seek to rectify amicably anything that may be construed as a mistake on our part however at this point im struggling to see any fault on our behalf to put this matter to rest i am going to need a response from you to prove that your invention was submitted with payment to our firm or your acknowledgment that this was a mistake on your behalf should i not receive this information from you by the end of this week i will need to consider other options regards trevor trevor lambert lambert  lambert inc respond to this report whats this are you an
