stanley capital international inc and standard  poors fund documents prospectus and fund reports fact sheet profile sheet  about risk active trading risk active trading of portfolio securities may result in added expenses a lower return and increased tax liability bank loan risk there are a number of risks associated with an investment in bank loans including credit risk interest rate risk liquidity risk and prepayment risk lack of an active trading market restrictions on resale irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods may impair the funds ability to sell bank loans within its desired time frame or at an acceptable price and its ability to accurately value existing and prospective investments extended trade settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the fund as a result the fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions to raise cash to meet its obligations the risk of holding bank loans is also directly tied to the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuing banks these risks could cause the fund to lose income or principal on a particular investment which in turn could affect the funds returns the value of bank loans can be affected by and sensitive to changes in government regulation and to economic downturns in the united states and abroad bank loans generally are floating rate loans which are subject to interest rate risk as the interest paid on the floating rate loans adjusts periodically based on changes in widely accepted reference rates changing fixed income market conditions risk the current low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero increases in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs commodities tax risk the tax treatment of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be adversely affected by changes in legislation regulations or other legally binding authority if as a result of any such adverse action the income of the fund from certain commoditylinked derivatives was treated as nonqualifying income the fund might fail to qualify as a regulated investment company and be subject to federal income tax at the fund level should the internal revenue service issue guidance or congress enact legislation that adversely affects the tax treatment of the funds use of the subsidiary which guidance might be applied to the fund retroactively it could among other consequences limit the funds ability to pursue its investment strategy commodity risk the fund may have investment exposure to the commodities markets andor a particular sector of the commodities markets which may subject the fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities such as stocks and bonds volatility in the commodities markets may be caused by changes in overall market movements domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies war acts of terrorism changes in domestic or foreign interest rates andor investor expectations concerning interest rates domestic and foreign inflation rates investment and trading activities of mutual funds hedge funds and commodities funds and factors such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and other regulatory developments or supply and demand disruptions because the funds performance may be linked to the performance of volatile commodities investors should be willing to assume the risks of potentially significant fluctuations in the value of the funds shares credit linked notes risk risks of credit linked notes include those risks associated with the underlying reference obligation including but not limited to market risk interest rate risk credit risk default risk and in some cases foreign currency risk an investor in a credit linked note bears counterparty risk or the risk that the issuer of the credit linked note will default or become bankrupt and not make timely payment of principal and interest of the structured security credit linked notes may be less liquid than other investments and therefore harder to dispose of at the desired time and price in addition credit linked notes may be leveraged and as a result small changes in the value of the underlying reference obligation may produce disproportionate losses to the fund debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions these risks are greater for the fund than mutual funds that do not use derivative instruments or that use derivative instruments to a lesser extent than the fund to implement their investment strategies emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information exchangetraded funds risk in addition to the risks associated with the underlying assets held by the exchangetraded fund investments in exchangetraded funds are subject to the following additional risks  an exchangetraded funds shares may trade above or below its net asset value  an active trading market for the exchangetraded funds shares may not develop or be maintained  trading an exchangetraded funds shares may be halted by the listing exchange  a passively managed exchangetraded fund may not track the performance of the reference asset and  a passively managed exchangetraded fund may hold troubled securities investment in exchangetraded funds may involve duplication of management fees and certain other expenses as the fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of any expenses paid by the exchangetraded funds in which it invests further certain exchangetraded funds in which the fund may invest are leveraged which may result in economic leverage permitting the fund to gain exposure that is greater than would be the case in an unlevered instrument and potentially resulting in greater volatility foreign currency tax risk if the us treasury department were to exercise its authority to issue regulations that exclude from the definition of qualifying income foreign currency gains not directly related to the funds business of investing in securities the fund may be unable to qualify as a regulated investment company for one or more years in this event the funds board of trustees may authorize a significant change in investment strategy or other action foreign government debt risk investments in foreign government debt securities sometimes referred to as sovereign debt securities involve certain risks in addition to those relating to foreign securities or debt securities generally the issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt and the fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default against the defaulting government without the approval of debt holders some governmental debtors have in the past been able to reschedule or restructure their debt payments or declare moratoria on payments foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful high yield debt securities junk bond risk investments in high yield debt securities junk bonds and other lowerrated securities will subject the fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuers ability to pay interest and principal when due are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile investment companies risk investing in other investment companies could result in the duplication of certain fees including management and administrative fees and may expose the fund to the risks of owning the underlying investments that the other investment company holds liquidity risk the fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the funds securities become illiquid the fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers andor subadvisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect because the funds investment process relies heavily on its asset allocation process market movements that are counter to the portfolio managers expectations may have a significant adverse effect on the funds net asset value in addition the fund is subject to the risk that the investment decisions made by the adviser or a subadviser may conflict with other decisions made by the adviser or the same or a different subadviser for example it is possible that the adviser may purchase a security for the fund at the same time that a subadviser sells the same security resulting in higher expenses without accomplishing any net investment result and possibly resulting in a wash sale for tax purposes which would defer the ability of the fund to utilize any realized loss conflicting investment decisions made by the adviser a subadviser or some combination thereof including decisions made by different teams in the adviser or the same subadviser also could subject the fund to other special tax rules that may for example defer or disallow the ability of the fund to utilize realized losses additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may affect the investments or investment strategies available to the portfolio managers in connection with managing the fund which may also adversely affect the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value mlp risk the fund invests in securities of mlps which are subject to the following risks limited partner risk an mlp is a public limited partnership or limited liability company taxed as a partnership under the code although the characteristics of mlps closely resemble a traditional limited partnership a major difference is that mlps may trade on a public exchange or in the overthecounter market the risks of investing in an mlp are similar to those of investing in a partnership including more flexible governance structures which could result in less protection for investors than investments in a corporation investors in an mlp normally would not be liable for the debts of the mlp beyond the amount that the investor has contributed but investors may not be shielded to the same extent that a shareholder of a corporation would be in certain circumstances creditors of an mlp would have the right to seek return of capital distributed to a limited partner which right would continue after an investor sold its investment in the mlp liquidity risk the ability to trade on a public exchange or in the overthecounter market provides a certain amount of liquidity not found in many limited partnership investments however mlp interests may be less liquid than conventional publicly traded securities and therefore more difficult to trade at desirable times andor prices interest rate risk in addition mlp distributions may be reduced by fees and other expenses incurred by the mlp mlps generally are considered interestrate sensitive investments during periods of interest rate volatility these investments may not provide attractive returns general partner risk the holder of the general partner or managing member interest can be liable in certain circumstances for amounts greater than the amount of the holders investment in the general partner or managing member additionally if the fund were to invest more than  of its total assets in mlps that are taxed as partnerships this could cause the fund to lose its status as regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code mlp tax risk mlps taxed as partnerships do not pay us federal income tax at the partnership level a change in current tax law or a change in the underlying business mix of a given mlp however could result in an mlp being classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes which would have the effect of reducing the amount of cash available for distribution by the mlp and as a result could cause a reduction of the value of the funds investment and consequently your investment in the fund and lower income each year the fund will send you an annual tax statement form  to assist you in completing your federal state and local tax returns if an mlp in which the fund invests amends its partnership tax return the fund will when necessary send you a corrected form  which could in turn require you to amend your federal state or local tax returns mortgage and assetbacked securities risk mortgage and assetbacked securities including collateralized debt obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that a borrowers payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans this could result in the fund reinvesting these early payments at lower interest rates thereby reducing the funds income mortgage and assetbacked securities also are subject to extension risk which is the risk that an unexpected rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of prepayments causing the price of the mortgage and assetbacked securities and the funds share price to fall an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of mortgagebacked securities and could result in losses to the fund the fund may invest in mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages which are loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages privately issued mortgagerelated securities are not subject to the same underwriting requirements as those with government or governmentsponsored entity guarantee and therefore mortgage loans underlying privately issued mortgagerelated securities may have less favorable collateral credit risk or other underwriting characteristics and wider variances in interest rate term size purpose and borrower characteristics noncorrelation risk the return of the funds preferred equity segment may not match the return of the underlying index for a number of reasons for example the fund incurs operating expenses not applicable to the index and incurs costs in buying and selling securities especially when rebalancing securities holdings to reflect changes in the index in addition the performance of the preferred equity segment and the underlying index may vary due to asset valuation differences and differences between the preferred equity segment and the index resulting from legal restrictions costs or liquidity constraints preferred securities risk preferred securities are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments subjecting them to a greater risk of nonpayment may be less liquid than many other securities such as common stocks and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer reit riskreal estate risk investments in real estate related instruments may be affected by economic legal cultural environmental or technological factors that affect property values rents or occupancies of real estate related to the funds holdings shares of real estate related companies which tend to be small and midcap companies may be more volatile and less liquid short position risk because the funds potential loss on a short position arises from increases in the value of the asset sold short the fund will incur a loss on a short position which is theoretically unlimited if the price of the asset sold short increases from the short sale price the counterparty to a short position or other market factors may prevent the fund from closing out a short position at a desirable time or price and may reduce or eliminate any gain or result in a loss in a rising market the funds short positions will cause the fund to underperform the overall market and its peers that do not engage in shorting if the fund holds both long and short positions and both positions decline simultaneously the short positions will not provide any buffer hedge from declines in value of the funds long positions certain types of short positions involve leverage which may exaggerate any losses potentially more than the actual cost of the investment and will increase the volatility of the funds returns subsidiary risk by investing in the subsidiary the fund is indirectly exposed to risks associated with the subsidiarys investments the subsidiary is not registered under the investment company act of  as amended  act and except as otherwise noted in this prospectus is not subject to the investor protections of the  act changes in the laws of the united states andor the cayman islands under which the fund and the subsidiary respectively are organized could result in the inability of the fund andor the subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and the sai and could negatively affect the fund and its shareholders us government obligations risk obligations of us government agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government which could affect the funds ability to recover should they default no assurance can be given that the us government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so as of  piafx nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is usually updated between  and  pm cst as of  yieldnbsp distribution yield with sales charge
