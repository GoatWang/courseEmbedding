were going to have to change our approach to marketing over the last year our whole team has been focused on building and expanding our digital marketing platform to include a strong focus in programmatic video and display advertising social media marketing and email marketing we also knew that we needed to expand our sales channels beyond the traditional drtv drive to call center or direct website model im pleased to report that ictv now sells our brands with over  major north american retailers that we had previously not worked with this time last year we have also been talking for several quarters about expanding our marketing platform across the pond im pleased to announce today that ictv launched dermawand into the united kingdom about four weeks ago after spending the better part of the summer building and setting up a sales and distribution platform that mimics what we do in north america a major investment has been made by our team over the last year to build ictv the sales and marketing infrastructure to succeed both now and in the future as a management team we continue to assess the challenges we face to take ictv to the next level of sustained growth

following  the closing of photomedex acquisition and the closing of the acquisition of ermis labs which is also discussed in note  we will begin to generate a higher level of revenues and net income as revenues and income from the sale of these new products are added to our current mix of products id like to turn the call back over to rich who will provide further details on these transactions rich ransom thank you ernie im going to spend a few minutes giving you an update on the major events of the third quarter and some exciting developments that weve been working on through the first half of the fourth quarter then kelvin and i will give updates on the acquisitions and our plans for integration of the new assets into ictvs platform the third quarter is traditionally the toughest quarter for our directtoconsumer business and north america as the weather is at its annual peak and many distractions are vying for our target audiences attention this summer presented additional distractions ph with the summer olympics spanning  days in august and two weeks of political conventions during late july and early august the political campaigns definitely had an effect on our media race which caused us to scale back our television media during the second half of the quarter on our second quarter call i announced that our management team had made the strategic decision to mimic the sales platform we have created in north america in the united kingdom during the third quarter our team worked very hard setting up all the necessary elements to launch a directtoconsumer marketing campaign in the united kingdom and were very pleased to report you today that during the week of october th dermawand had officially launched in the united kingdom via digital marketing and print media todate weve spent approximately  dollars on digital media in the uk across facebook and google adwords and approximately  on print media across three publications the total return on the  in spend has been just over  in revenue resulting in a contribution to profit of about  since we launched in the uk the dermawand is currently selling for £ pounds which includes the  valueadded tax were required to collect in the net we have initially set up to sell dermawand as a single payment option unlike north america where we offer a free trial and installment payments we intend in the future to offer an installment payment option which will be three payments of £ our marketing team is confident this change will result in a higher conversion and a higher media efficiency ratio or mer which is exciting considering were already at almost three mer in regards to expanding our sales distribution in the uk we plan to follow the same model of working with major retailers both online and instore to give customers more options of where to buy our products we also plan to work with live shopping channels on the last call i had announced that we had an airdate with idealworld which is one of the major live shopping channels in england for a variety of reasons the september airdate that was announced was postponed we now have resolved the issues that prevented us from airing and are working on a date to launch dermawand on ideal shopping in december last item i want to discuss with you today in relation to the third quarter results is our efforts in expanding our retail footprint north american online retail sales continue to thrive throughout the third quarter the two most notable are walmart us and costco canada walmart launched in the second quarter of this year but it is striving the third quarter steadily increasing from selling between  to  dermawands a week to consistently selling between  to  units a week throughout the third quarter walmart has taken notice of this success as  and as a result we have been selected to participate in one of their black friday cyber monday promotions which will showcase dermawand as one of their four selected beauty items in a sitewide campaign selected amongst thousands of other products were very excited to see this type of exposure for dermawand from this retail giant during the most shop time of year a little further north in canada dermawand launched on costcoca in september sales started strong out of the gate with  to  orders per week in the first two weeks to further promote dermawand to the costco members we have anticipated in their weekly email blast promotions that have increased sales significantly the most recent blast yielded over  orders in one week to capitalize on this success we will be participating in their black friday cyber monday promotions that will be paired with another email blast we expect to easily sell in the triple digits during this promotional period the online retail expansion continues to spread as we enter the fourth quarter with multiple brands launching on cvscom and kohlscom which is already yielding plus dermawand orders a week we have also been approved to launch on targetcom and our hope is to be live with a dermawand listing before black friday in addition to the online retail environment we continue to expand our footprint into traditional brickandmortar retail in october we began a relationship with the canadian retail network of over  banner pharmacies called mckesson by dermawand being included in the product portfolio of mckesson each pharmacy can independently order product in the first month  pharmacies ordered dermawands which we consider a great start in the us we have now completed production of the instore retail displays for bed bath and beyond and are just awaiting the order for the exact stores we expect to have dermawand placed in  stores if sales are strong in those stores we would expect bed bath and beyond to begin rolling us out chainwide in the first half of  there many other exciting projects that our sales and marketing teams are working on to expand the awareness of our  and sales of our brands and i wish i had more time to share them all with you however at this point in the call i want to transition to a discussion on the recently announced acquisitions as mentioned earlier on october th ictv filed an k with the sec detailing two definitive asset purchase agreements the first agreement calls for ictv to purchase the consumer assets of photomedex inc trading symbol phmd this agreement includes the acquisition of the proprietary products and services that addressed skin diseases and conditions or pain reduction using homeused devices for various indications including hair removal acne treatment skin rejuvenation and lower back pain their products are currently sold and distributed to traditional retail online and infomercial outlets and include nono hair nono skin nono glow made you look made you look smooth skin care kyrobak and cleartouch which is a device that uses photo therapy to treat nail fungus in addition to acquiring the intellectual property of the aforementioned brands as part of the agreement ictv will also acquire  million of gaap inventory meaning that the product is salable and not reserved on photomedexs books well also be acquiring subsidiaries of photomedex in brazil and hong kong in the same k i referenced above we also announced acquisition of all the assets of ermis labs inc in exchange for  million shares of ictv common stock and a  cap  royalty cap at  million with a minimum guaranteed payment of  per year the assets of ermis labs include the patent for our previously licensed acne treatment system branded coralactives as well as a variety of formulas for the medicated soap bars that treat conditions such as acne dermatitis psoriasis and dandruff as part of the acquisition ictv will be acquiring inventory of approximately  medicated soap bars as well as the web domain medicatedbarscom our team believes both of these acquisitions fit perfectly into our marketing and distribution platform and now id like to turn the call over to kelvin who will give you some more specifics as to our plans for these assets kelvin claney thank you rich and good afternoon i would like to  i would like that everyone who has joined us  id like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today im often amazed when i think about the number of shareholders who have been with us for several years and continue to support our efforts through the good and the tough time that weve had over the years and i sincerely want to thank you for that support as rich referenced above our earnings call year ago was very difficult as we announced a major shift in our strategy to build a digital platform and expand our distribution channels we knew at the time we would need to take a step back to be able to take a giant leap forward im pleased to be able to say to those longterm shareholders that was this announced acquisition  with these announced acquisitions i truly believe ictv is poised to take that giant leap forward when we became aware of the opportunity to acquire the nono brand from photomedex it was clear from the beginning that it will be a perfect brand to fit into ictvs platform but what also became apparent quickly was that there are several aspects of this field that will be very beneficial to ictvs current products particularly dermawand one specific example of this was the operation that photomedex has set up in the united  has set up in the united kingdom rich and ernie just got back from a trip to visit their office in the uk and they were very impressed with the people and the operation currently photomedex uk generates about £ million per year across several sales channels that include direct response television and print traditional bricksandmortar retail and live television home shopping qvc uk qvc france qvc italy and qvc germany begins in early  our nono hair has sold in major retail outlets in the uk including booths ph in august were highly confident that the team in the uk will be able to leverage these relationships to help get dermawand major retail placement more quickly than ictv would have been able to do so on its own the second part of the trip for rich and ernie took them to israel as it’s the logistics and research and development teams that were in that area the guys also very impressed with the talent and knowledge base that existed in israel which was not a surprise to any of us i think it was long admired how their rd team consistently brings that innovative new versions of the nono brand into the market for those of you who have followed ictv for a while are aware we have struggled to quickly develop in next generation dermawand unit despite our hopes that we expressed on the last call in august that we were only weeks away from building the tooling for dermawand we have yet  we have not yet been able to build that to indiscernible to the challenge of fitting all the components necessary onto the circuit board to meet global rate regulations while reducing the size of the overall unit the good news is that we believe weve solved the issue and are just waiting for one more capacitor which should arrive within  days assuming it all fits the tooling of the new unit i could begin to be manufactured by the end of the month with the team in israel were confident that well be able to continue to create new products for both nono and dermawand brands that will help ictv keep both brands relevant in the global marketplace for many years to come in addition today to the ways dermawand and our other brands will benefit from this acquisition we believe the work our team has done to expand our digital marketing footprint over the last several quarters will boost the sales of the brands we are acquiring for instance todate photomedex has not had much success in scaling sales through social media with digital programmatic marketing our team was highly confident there was a huge untapped audience in the cyberspace that is yet to be exposed to the nono brand and that we have built the right platform to be able to reach them in regards to email marketing one of the assets we are acquiring from photomedex that is not gotten much attention as it probably should have is the over  million customer emails that ictv will be acquiring between north america and the united kingdom while we know what needs to be done to scrub this list and that the actual deliverable list will likely be reduced to the size were excited to be able to have so many customers in our dermawand demographic that we will be able to email special offers to both in the us and uk market another area of opportunity with the acquired brands will be to drop them into our north american retail channels as of right now the only instore payment for nono  placement for nono is in the us bed bath and beyond chain our sales team has already been in discussions with several of our retail partners and they are all very excited about the opportunity to carry the brands we are acquiring by having more brands and the pipeline of product that the team will provide were confident they will be able to grow our retail sales channel in north america substantially in  and beyond id now like to now take the last few minutes of my time to discuss our plans regarding the second acquisition we announced on october th which is the acquisition of the assets of ermis labs let me first start by giving you a little background of how we  how this all came about as many of you know we had a license for one of the products ermis labs has develop called coralactives which is a patented acne treatment system in the early part of this year we were notified that ermis labs is the name to be had gone out of business and the assets were acquired by multifamily office out of new jersey called the leo group over the spring in summer ictv had been in discussions with the leo group about how ictv could potentially be the marketing platform for the ermis labs asset in late summer when the photomedex acquisition discussion got serious we approached the principle of the leo group to acquire about the groups interest in participating in the photomedex deal we all agreed this is a great opportunity to also bring the ermis labs assets into ictv and bring leo group and the principles in as a shareholder of ictv were very excited about the assets were acquiring from ermis labs rich has his team have been selling the benzyl peroxide medical medicated soap bars through amazon over the last year with basically no marketing support and only selling through the amazon we sold about  bars of the last two quarters in september ictv was also approached by dermatology group out of maryland who wanted to purchase  bathroom ph so we know theres much more marketing potential in the professional market we believe with our digital platform well be able to specifically target people suffering from the disorders that these medicated soap bars can help solve we also know that the retail partners we have are excited to carry the bars not only online but in the stores as well once the deal was announced since we had inventory for coralactives our sales team began approaching retailers and several of them are in the process of placing coralactives on their ecommerce sites including cvs and walmart so much more could be said about our plans for integration and as we get close to the closing we will all be sure  we will be sure to provide frequent updates to you so now id like to close by saying that im so thankful for the many people that have made it possible for ictv to be in a position to take this giant step forward to grow our company a special thanks goes out to those of who have already committed to funds that made the signing of these deals possible i also wanted to  i want to acknowledge our dedicated staffs who have been working long hours preparing for integration while still expanding the sales channels for dermawand and other brands and to my fellow longtime shareholder a special thanks for sticking with us through all the ups and downs over the years the opportunity that is before our company is exciting and this is exactly what we persevered over these years im very confident that these acquisitions will be transformative to our company and to our shareholders now i would like to turn the call back over to rich for some closing comments rich ransom thank you kelvin and thank you all again for joining us today i wanted to add a few closing thoughts as it relates to ictv posts the closing of these asset acquisitions assuming we close the full  million private placement we anticipate the outstanding shares posttransaction will be just over  million shares were confident that despite the dilution the transaction will be accretive to the shareholders of ictv in regards to the closing of the transactions we are not entirely sure of an exact date as photomedex is still waiting on final approval of their shareholder proxy by the sec once we have more definitive  a more definitive timetable for closing we will communicate that to our shareholders finally as kelvin did i want to thank all those stakeholders of ictv that have made it possible for us to be in the position we are today our team is committed to making the integration of the assets as quickly and efficiently as possible im extremely optimistic about the future of ictv and our ability to significantly increase shareholder value both in the coming year and for many years to come thank you again for your participation in the call today operator wed like to open the call now for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and we do have a question from jason indiscernible your line is open rich ransom thank you jason unidentified analyst first congratulations on the recent deal it was a pleasure meeting you all at the microcap conference on october th i think new those an exciting opportunity for this company is something i and probably many other investments have been anxiously awaiting can you speak to the reasons why photomedex is agreeing to such a tremendous deal ernest kollias jr certainly and it was great meeting you and everyone else who attended the microcap conference on the th and th and the oneonone sessions that followed that rich and i were able to participate in if you followed any of the releases regarding photomedex in recent years they entered into a few costly acquisitions with extensive financing most recently one that resulted in a massive selloff which provided an opportunity for an interested and qualified buyers such as ictv and as you can tell on october th we released the public information with the announcement of the acquisition so we were positioned nicely to be able to take advantage of that deal unidentified analyst okay great thanks any further details you are going to provide regarding your due diligence trip to the uk and israel rich ransom ill step into that jason thanks again for the questions and it was great meeting you in philadelphia in late october the trip was really  was really great we had gotten a lot of due diligence material prior to the signing of the deals so we knew all of the financial aspects related to both entities that we visited but it was really a trip about meeting the people and the uk operation in particular from a sales standpoint is very impressive its what we as a company have strived to do in the us and are in the process of doing but it was great to see it in its full potential as we were able to walk through retail stores see the nono placed on the shelf see the different materials that they use to present qvc around europe and it just gave us a real picture and the what the potential is as we bring dermawand into the united kingdom directly and it was really exciting its a lien team like us it fits in perfectly to what were trying to do and in israel that was a very exciting trip in the sense of understanding how the process is done to go through and as kelvin had mentioned in his comments we historically have not been a development company weve tried to do it with the new dermawand unit and while were confident that we are on the precipice of a starting production of that unit its been a very hard and painful process seeing the team thats over there and seeing what theyve done i think nono hair is in its sixth or seventh version at this point and theres two or three in the pipeline already that havent hit market its just so exciting to think about the future for dermawand in that respect and know that that the assets were acquiring are not single products but they are actually product lines that will be developed over time so obviously theres a lot of decisions to be made and were going to make them over the next several weeks before closing but were confident that beyond the assets that weve kind of detailed that were acquiring theres some very very talented people across the globe that are going to be coming on to the ictv team operator thank you well take our next question from mike indiscernible your line is open unidentified analyst yes i had the same question really is whats the catch on the acquisition youre spending was  million total price they are giving you  million in revenue and  million in inventory i mean pretty much guarantee for free you just finally got ph in the business so bad kelvin claney no mike first of all one of the things that a lot of people ask is this is a falling knife is this business over but we did a lot of due diligence and thats simply not the case theres huge potential in the business but if you  and growth in the business i mean without being smart womens hair just doesnt go away its there so it’s a massive market and if you look at the history of the company they made these really terrible business decisions i made a lot of money quickly and i made a terrible business of decisions about getting into areas of market that they had no place to be in lasik  chains of lasik eye chains and then they went into the instore doctor psoriasis business it just wasnt what they should be doing in and then what they were  what they didn’t bank on which we have seen sore was a changing landscape of this directtoconsumer marketing so they carried on blindly with their television business and we didnt we realized what was coming we made a major change they didn’t make that change so all of a sudden tv is not as profitable as south go down now all of a sudden it has implications on the loans their loan get on convents their loans get called now they spiral  they are in debt spiral they are selling off assets they buys assets for  million a year later they are selling them for  million and it just becomes a domino effect they didnt take hard decisions as we did a year ago we cut  of our staff they cut basically no staff and so i dont know what they were thinking i mean i dont they were thinking they didnt try to sell their business outright they lined up a deal thats going to be sold to another public company for  million and that deal got sidelined by the sec i mean that was a fiasco then they had somebody else come in and make them  and thats where it really got interesting somebody else who they were with in a patent situation with cayman and we had the opportunity to  that deal fell apart we had the opportunity to make an offer and get it it was as simple as that unidentified analyst are they profitable or its tired itself because they got so m any different business lines kelvin claney yes mike i would refer you to their financial releases i think they havent put third quarter out yet but if you look at their note on the segment reporting in their notes of the financials youll see that the consumer asset piece is profitable and we really dug hard into that because that was  in part of our due diligence we really needed to understand hey are we acquiring something thats going to suck cash or not and the business itself is profitable their overhead could not  it didn’t make enough profit to sustain their overhead and some of the other public company cost and things that they were involved in due to some of their struggles over the last couple years the real simple short answer to your question is they were at the end of the line it was basically either sell these assets or go bankrupt and we were in a position to step in and do what needed to be done to keep them out of bankruptcy their public shell will survive this is and i think thats their interest in that but i dont really want to speak for them in terms of why they did it but i think thats the simplest answer of how were able to get it achieved unidentified analyst okay we wish you the best luck then kelvin claney thanks mike we really appreciate it unidentified analyst thank you thats all from me operator operator instructions well move next to jason  im sorry gerry indiscernible your line is open unidentified analyst hey two general questions one maybe its my computer but i received a notice for the conference call at   minutes before the call is that cause you guys send them out that late or i have a problem the second question is is there  you guys foresee any impact because the republicans won in the states versus the democrats has that anything to do with the product and supply in demand rich ransom i dont know weve got to call in to see if more hair is going to grow ernest kollias jr to answer your first question gerry we sent out a press release a week ago today announcing call and then the email you got this afternoon was a followup with our press release for the third quarter results that had the call details in it as well so it was kind of the second reminder unidentified analyst okay then my end i got to check my computer thank you for the answer kelvin claney gerry its kelvin here good to hear from you youre one of our longest time shareholder could you do me special favor could you send me that really wonderful photographs that you have of the boat on the rocks i want to  could you send it because i lost that and i want to put that on my wall unidentified analyst im not sure what picture boat maybe its a senior moment here i dont know what picture of boat give me little more detail what boat and what rock kelvin claney ill come back to after the call unidentified analyst okay kelvin claney okay in terms of your second question gerry im not sure if i have any insight into whether the election results will affect us if we go to our  tax rate and we start making the profit we think we can make it could be very positive unidentified analyst well no thats a good answer because its not like you guys are sitting there behind the scenes of your pl your business model has some bearing on the results of election so your answer is well we really dont know so that means business is usual good answer kelvin claney yes unidentified analyst thank you kelvin claney you got it rich ransom thanks gerry operator and we have a followup from jason indiscernible unidentified analyst hi again guys just a question regarding  i saw that the nono has been significant sales with the airlines specifically i believe it was hong kong you guys planning on taking advantage of that with your other product lines rich ransom no thats a great question jason and i think we mentioned in the prepared remarks theres really so many things we could talk about and just wanted to keep it concise but the airline business out of hong kong is really the reason why that entity is being acquired i believe its about  airlines that photomedex has relationships with for the nono and its not only nono hair but nono skin which is their acne device it was a lot easier to acquire that entity and the  and those relationships rather than try to transfer them and to your question specifically yes we have already while in israel who kind of oversees that operation we already began talking about how we could design a package for dermawand because its a cart business on the plane you have to have a very small box to fit on the cart so they are already starting to think through how they can prepare that packaging so we can present that to the airlines very very quickly so great question operator operator instructions and it appears that we have no  actually we do have a question from ken indiscernible your line is open unidentified analyst hey guys im sorry i tuned in late so i have a couple of questions that i dont know if been asked or answered you presenting at ld micro in december rich ransom that is correct ken unidentified analyst do you know what time and day rich ransom ill be presenting wednesday december th at  am unidentified analyst okay i look forward to that and second do you know when youre going to close on the acquisition with phmd rich ransom we did reference that at the end of the prepared remarks we dont know at this point the exact date the photomedex is waiting on some comments on their proxy from the sec nothing we think is going to be a problem just basically they have to wait on those comments before they can file a final proxy and proceed with their shareholder vote so its really dependent upon how long that process takes but were still very hopeful that the transaction well be able to close hopefully by the end of the year unidentified analyst is there any  do they have the votes in already or that has to wait for the sec rich ransom they cant begin  the proxy will be sent out to receive he votes no they do not have the votes in yet ernest kollias jr they cant send out until they go  till they answer the deficiencies from the sec unidentified analyst okay last question any plans for expanding ir ernest kollias jr i mean i think we are expanding ir by attending the conferences we have and well continue  weve been pretty active with putting news out so well continue to do that as well unidentified analyst okay i know you presented at the microcap conference and you deal with a lot of very very good information there can you get that on your website ernest kollias jr yes the exact presentation that was given at the conference is now posted under the investor relations section on ictvbrandscom unidentified analyst okay one suggestion and really respectfully made if you can get the word out to your shareholders and to the markets that it is there i mean it really was a very good presentation just filled with information so putting it there on your website helps but it also helps to advertise the fact that its there and its another way of reaching out to the market ernest kollias jr good suggestion thank you ken unidentified analyst all right thank you guys best of wishes okay rich ransom thank you ken ernest kollias jr thank you ken appreciate it operator and that concludes our interview at this time  or questions i should say rich ransom okay well thank you very much everyone who has participated the last comment i want to make today is that today is our
