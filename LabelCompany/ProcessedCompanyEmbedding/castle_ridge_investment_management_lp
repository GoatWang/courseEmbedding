contact us client login checklist  questions every advisor should be able to answer whatever your priorities this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life at one time or another we all face major turning points in our lives—getting married becoming a parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances timelines and investing preferences more insights wondering what its like to work with an advisor tune in to a candid conversation on “the value of advice” watch the webcast  how will we keep my strategy on course even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change an advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone one of an advisors most vital functions is to reach out at such times hear your concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences what can an advisor do for you watch making the leap to see how one couple – with the help of their advisor – built a business while keeping their retirement goals in sight

visit our page find an advisor contact us client login checklist  questions every advisor should be able to answer whatever your priorities this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life at one time or another we all face major turning points in our lives—getting married becoming a parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances timelines and investing preferences more insights wondering what its like to work with an advisor tune in to a candid conversation on “the value of advice” watch the webcast  how will we keep my strategy on course even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change an advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone one of an advisors most vital functions is to reach out at such times hear your concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences what can an advisor do for you watch making the leap to see how one couple – with the help of their advisor – built a business while keeping their retirement goals in sight
