president chief financial officer principal accounting officer and director analysts brent rystrom  feltl robert kirkpatrick  cardinal capital operator good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the pure cycle corporation q  earnings call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session and instructions will follow at that time operator instructions as a reminder todays call maybe recorded i would now like to introduce your host for todays conference mark harding president and ceo sir you may begin mark w harding thank you thank you very much id like to welcome you all to pure cycle corporations first quarter november   first quarter fiscal  earnings call before we get started we do have slide deck for this presentation which can be found on our website you have to go to the website and then right there on the front page at the bottom of the screen it will talk about the presentation click on that that will bring up the presentation and then you can follow along with me and ill try and note the transition of the slides as we move through each of the slide also before we get started i want to say that were all here in denver still morning over our performance of the afc west divisional playoff first night we had a hopeful opportunity for advancing and being now here this year but unfortunately we of course had different play book in mind with that said let me talk about pure cycle there is number of exciting things that we want to highlight and also give you guys an update as to what our expectations are for the year and some of the moving parts that have been occurring relative to oil and gas and some of the companys operations so our first slide here is our safe harbor statement which identifies that statements are not historical facts that are not historical facts contained in here by reference by this presentation are forwardlooking statements within that meaning of the sec reform act of  with that said let me talk to slide three talk a little bit about the milestone achievements for our first quarter  we had three real areas of emphasis we want to talk about and really drill down on some color on one is the oil and gas activities at sky ranch weve had two wells drilled on the sky ranch property which hold all  acres of our mineral lease by production and they are – the first well was completed in late october the second well was completed in late november and they are – the first well was fracked i think in december and then the second one is set schedule for frac sometime later this week second component was the completion of some contingencies in our wise project this was a project that youve heard me speak about often over the last few years it’s a project which is a regional project water project where it involves some infrastructure and some water supply i want to talk a little bit about that that were excited about this acquisition and the availability of additional infrastructure for our operations as well as additional water and then thirdly i want to talk a little bit more about the foreclosure process and elimination of more the tap participation fee that we have relative to the high plains default that weve been processing over the last couple of years so if you move to the next slide first quarter fiscal  we have again each area of operations our increased revenues from our first quarter of  and continuing our trend towards profitability as we saw in q this is q  it shows profitability each element whether that’s delivering water through fracking water services our municipal revenues as well as agriculture leasing portfolio all saw increases in that total revenues of about  for the quarter end moving to our next slide talk a little bit about the industrial water sales this is probably one where i think everybody would like a little color on but we saw water sales qoverq between  and  increase about  demonstrating our system expansion capacities from  we will likely see compatible results of this for the first half of the year however as i am sure this will be news to this wont be news to anybody there is been precipitated decline in oil and i want to talk little bit about what that means to the company and what that really means to the company as that there is likely to be fewer oil wells drilled within our service area this year we do not have much guidance from our operators ph as to what additional well activity would occur but we can say that they have laid down the rigs that they had operating in this area and they have deferred additional rigs that were scheduled for the field until further notice so while we do have an understanding is that the field has very good permits ph the results that had been published on the field have been very positive we know the operators continue to invest in well permits they are lining up as many well permits and pad sites as possible to be able to continue to proceed developing the field they are working on product pipelines whether that’s oil and gas pipelines it got rights of ways that they are working and we are working in conjunction with them on some of that stuff to be able to colocate some water lines at some point in the future and be able to take a look at how we continue to expand operations and service to this field the field itself and i think this probably is pretty indicative of most of the shale oil plays but the field itself i think is been fairly well defined operators have pretty good understanding of how they would go about it the well drill time has significantly compressed with the last few wells just because theyve understood most of the science and mechanics of the field so they have fairly good understanding of how they like to continue developing the field but i think its going to be function of the price of oil what we really don’t have a good feel for is that what price of oil would thus change the dynamics for additional wells that they would drill into the field we will continue to update you with that stuff as we become – be aware of that from our operators that are working in this field but for the time being we have very good results very good operating margins very good delivery of additional capacity from our system expansion and continue to meet the expectations of our operators in this field moving to the next slide this kinds of gives you an overview and a snapshot of the field area i think as i discussed in our year end call little bit ago there is some – there is number of wells that are in this area that are very nice wells they are – what they call gas driven wells they are producing just with the gas drive on that i think the operators drilled – the field itself has seen about  wells this i think so it’s about  but i think they are up to about to  wells in this particular area and some of what this shows is some of the infrastructure that is located in this area you have existing gas collection lines that are taking the gas product to market some of that is still under construction some of that still yet to be defined weve got some rightofways that extend up to our property at sky ranch were looking at colocating within that rightofway for some water transmission facilities which will improve our operational aspects of delivering water at a – and more cost effective rate then being able to do this all by transmission lines on the ground and be able to maintain higher service flow capacities from that type of line so we continue to work on expanding our operations in this area were very cautious about doing that i don’t want to be over extended in this area the system expansion that we had in  i think was very – a very even expansion where we were able to expand our system with reserves that the company had without over extending ourselves all at the same time making adequate investments so that we increase the production capacity for the operators in this field so i think we struck the right balance between increasing the system capacity without over extending that based on whatever we are hearing on continued development continued expansion for field operations moving to the next slide talk a little bit about our oil and gas royalty revenue as you know we have a  gross royalty interest on  acres that we have there is actually two wells that will be drilled into our formation if you move to the next slide slide eight we show you a sort of photo of where these two wells are going be there located on the very east edge of the property the sky ranch well is actually on our property the property reserve well is actually not on our property that’s on property that the company does not own there is half section there that we do not own but it pools mineral estate these are  foot laterals so they pool two square miles  acre poolings on each of these so these two wells are very close proximity to each other and so they were drilled at different intervals but they were sort of fracked simultaneously and they really are fracking these things sequentially because you cant put one line one well online with them being as closest they are then you diffract these two sort of in sequence and then be able of complete them and bring them online so the second property reserve one is schedule for frac starting later this week the fracs on these continue to be inline with the same amount of water usage as weve seen historically on that some where around the   million gallons of water fracs so they go through some where between  and  stages of fracs on those and really complete that after theyve got those done so company should have a better indication of what these wells will produce probably some time in the spring they will complete them then well probably bring these online they will have some level of production beginning in february march timeframe and then well have the better idea what that’s going to look like let me talk a little bit about the next slide our agricultural operations so revenues for our agriculture operations are up a bit we continue to work on this portfolio continue to look at how were optimizing our rents both our cash rents as well as our crop share rents our rents are still predominantly cash lease rents we had a more typical agriculture year in the arkansas valley in  then we did in previous years due to the drought but i think our leasing policies still has a little bit of leverage room and were going to continue to look at opportunities for us to be able to improve and return of this asset whether that’s taking a look at working with the farmers on a crop share basis or making improvements into the farm lands for higher efficiency irrigation practices like sprinkle systems and others next slide i want to talk a little bit about the default the high plains am defaults i think weve really talked about this over the last four or five quarters and really nothing new other than we have processed couple more farms through that we have one remaining foreclosure so weve cleared titled to nearly all of the farms that we were looking to bring to the foreclosure and really eliminated almost all of the tap participation fee weve got about  million remaining on the tap participation fee we had one lawsuit that was dismissed in september with the cooperation of high plains we have couple of lawsuits that are really nearing their completion we have trial schedule for those in late february so i think most of the – most of the prefatory work on those have been done i think the depositions and all that are complete and the real activity ph straightforward trials looking at interpretations of the contract our remedies as we view those remedies compared to what high plains view those remedies but we think that this will certainly have a positive impact for us to resolve any remaining litigation that we have and weve had a little bit of that with the state land board and with high plains over the last couple of years moving over to our next slide talk a little bit about our utility operations our municipal water  wastewater services still are very marginal components in terms of contribution to revenue and earnings for the company but those are still up a little bit moving to the next slide talk a little bit about the acquisition that weve made relative to the segment we – our wholesale water and wastewater provider and we really focused most of our acquisitions on that activity and as weve been talking about over the last several quarters weve been working with the south metro water supply authority and the south metro wise authority to be able to bring online a very innovative very cooperative project where we have something called wise project and can have a government project without having accruement ph in that but if the water infrastructure sharing efficiency project and this is really is an outstanding project because what it does is it ties  different water providers water systems together and allows you to maneuver water to and from the entities within that in addition to having some water as a part of this equation it has some infrastructure component and that’s one of the things that attracted us to the project is the infrastructure that allows water from lowry to be able to be accessible and provide water into and get water from this system and so there is about  or  miles of infrastructure that already existing that were buying from an existing water provider and then that acquisition gets tied into an inter connected among the various members of that the key components of it are were – that our participation in the water side is were getting an additional  acre feet of water pursuant to this project and that water is coming from the south plat from city of aurora and the city of denver’s water supplies as they have those available were getting about  mgd of pipeline capacity within the system and it’s a phased purchase so we have an incremental purchase over a period of  years i think our projections are that we have about  million to  million a year that will be invested in this acquisition our  expenditures have been budgeted within the company so we have the liquidity for all of those expenditures and we do believe this is going to be a very unique opportunity for the company to be able to expand our systems and provide additional water supplies and also be able to add to additional supplies should those needs arise from continuing operations either through oil and gas or through the development of our sky ranch supplies the other thing that this does is it does have an integration for the potential use and development of our reservoirs at lowry whether we work in conjunction with the south metro authority or with the neighboring city of aurora we have a number of opportunities on being able to take a look at how those reservoirs and those assets become available for use and become an opportunity for the company to monetize those and then also incorporate those into additional project so from the utility model side of the company were very excited about this adding to our portfolio we think it’s a great acquisition we think it’s a great opportunity for us and for all of the participant in the project moving to the next slide talk a little bit about sky ranch as many of you know we have about  acre parts of property right along the i corridor and really this is going to be continuing the focus of our energies and our efforts over the coming year the denver real estate market continues to be a very active and probably one of the better major metropolitan markets in the united states we continue to see increased house prices we can see constricting or timing of available lot supply in the market so you see all of the metrics that we track are all favorable over the last several years and they continue to demonstrate a very robust a very strong market weve got a lot of interest in sky ranch it’s a complex project because you have – you have a big thousand acres it’s about  single family homes zone for it you have a large component of commercial square feet commercial retail square feet that also zone right along the front edge along the interstate a lot of opportunities for us in this and so what were looking for is to be able to identify how the company would like proceed the board continues to evaluate all sorts of different opportunities whether that’s joint venturing with somebody being able to sell this to a developer with some certainty on timing of developments and being able to help partner with them with some of the resources that the company has so i don’t have too much more specificity to that other than we are – that continues to be main focus for what the company is looking at and the market continues to demonstrate a very healthy climate for our opportunities in this area so with that as some of the color on some of the achievements i also want to kind of highlight the financial performance because you always highlight when youre in the black ph on your quarter so we really our water deliveries are up as well as our water revenues so water revenues are up about  and again about most of that due to increased water deliveries for fracking water sales moving to the next slide the general and administrative expenses ga is in line maybe just a slight increase over where we were in  and really that’s – that should start to decline weve processed all of our foreclosures through the process so we don’t have any additional cost associated with that and we are nearing completion with our litigation cost and the set up for those litigation as you know as anybody who is been involved with litigation much of the prefatory work is high cost on that so we look for ga expenses to level out or even decline as we see year end results yearoveryear for the company moving to the next slide  we love to show a slide that shows positive revenue results so continuing trend of profitability from q into q of  one of the tangible results of the foreclosure process is really the elimination of the impudicus ph interest expense from that high plains royalty obligation and while that was really never direct range on liquidity for the company it did have skewing of the effects of the pl so were delighted that that’s going to have a more readable presentation for investors as they as they continue to screen the company and be able to look at our operations where our revenue drivers are where our liquidity needs are and where the overall results of the operation so that’s going to be a delight to be able to show those on a more tangible basis rather than showing at imputed interest expense moving over to current assets we are due in a very healthy liquidity position the larger drop here as we display this for our current assets is really attributable to the reclassification of the default receivable moneys from high plains and we move those from our current asset to a longterm asset so you know the company has good liquidity we have good cash and cash equivalence to be able to continue through our operations as well as the acquisition of the wise project total assets in line so we really have no change in the total assets well see a bit of reclassification some of the investments that were making from the wise project and then ultimately the equity section increased significantly q  over q  predominantly as a result of processing all of the high plains in and foreclosures so weve got summary of our balance sheet information as well as our statement of operations and then lastly i do want to note that we do have an address change we have moved our addresses out actually closer to where our operation field operations are so we are actually working operating as off quincy which is directly across the street from the lowry range some of you that have been indiscernible facility this was where the conoco headquarters are and there is a number of other commercial buildings here that are owned for – by our project group that we lease some space on so were delighted to be a little closer to our operations to make our overall operating systems and facilities much more tangible much easier for our operating personal staff so with that what id like to do is hand this over to qa and see if i can drill down any more specifics on some of the color on these things but what i do want to really emphasize is the company is in terrific shape we have excellent liquidity our water utility model continues go grow we continue to make investments and expand our water and wastewater systems and our water infrastructure capacities to continue to deliver to grow that model the real estate market continues to strengthen and continues to show a great opportunity for us on the lands that we own within the sky ranch property and we look forward to really monetizing that property as well as additional opportunities relative to the wise project so with that ill hand it over and see if anybody is getting any specific questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions we do have a question from brent rystrom with feltl your line is now open brent r rystrom hi good afternoon mark just a couple of quick ones when you listed the options for sky ranch the development of it are you looking at all at any self development options or just the ones that you kind of identified in your prepared comments mark w harding yes we continue to look at that one of the things that we want to try and look at is the best structure and then also the best way to develop it so if somebody ways the magic wand and says okay here is  million to invest in the project how would you put that to years and that give us an understanding of how to best fees it how to best look at the start of where those moneys would be best spend and so weve spent sometime working with partners and developers to understand those types of questions and then see about how that partnering would work and if it’s not a partnering you know how the company would look at it there are opportunities where we may find an opportunity to make some investments along those lines were very as you know were very cautious of invested capital very cautious of our equity capita so those things play very heavily indiscernible just as well as our board’s analysis but there are phase opportunities for us to take a look at there so we tried to take a way the issue of cost of capital and really look at it as use of the capital and make sure that we understand the project and its fundamentals on each element of that and more and more readdress the areas of cost to capital because we certainly appreciate a start of that project has tremendous opportunities for us within how we develop the utility franchise and so there maybe opportunities for us to leverage each of those to make this an opportunity in how we move this thing forward with our partners brent r rystrom okay quick follow up to that as youre looking at that any headcount additions as you value with sky ranch that you could see coming in  mark w harding i do not see that we have – i think we have adequate staffing for that matter of fact we have adequate staffing were going to be putting some water transmission lines in the ground that weve already purchased weve got the existing staff to be able to do that so there is some incremental investment that we are able to do where we can add service capacity to the property without having any additional staff brent r rystrom right and final question any particular thoughts any sense on what the major developer the niobrara is telling you as far as whole payments versus drilling any visibility at all for that mark w harding no i don’t i do know that if i just do the back of the envelope math for myself and take a look at some of the leases that were familiar with they have a substantial amount of wells that they would need to consider over the next couple of years to be able holding most of those by production there maybe as many as  wells if my numbers are correct on lowry and then maybe   wells off of lowry that hold all those leases by production so the  wells that theyve been drilling to date i think give them a substantial look at what the field is and in all relations to the footprint that they have so they have a very large they have  square mile footprint that about   acres that i think they have a pretty good idea of what this field is going to look like over that over and across that field so it seems to be fairly attractive given what theyve announced in their results and so i think this is one of those domestic plays that is a good longterm play and we look for them to be a continued operator out here for very very long time so there maybe that will be some pull back i know there is going to be pull back in  i don’t know to what extent theyll have additional wells in  but i think they still look at this field is a very attractive longterm field brent r rystrom thank you operator our next question comes from jeffrey scot indiscernible asset management your line is now open unidentified analyst hi mark mark w harding hi jeffrey unidentified analyst there have been three wells drilled to date right mark w harding on sky ranch is actually two wells drilled on sky ranch unidentified analyst okay all right and those are nonroyalty wells mark w harding they are royalty wells unidentified analyst they are royalty wells mark w harding yes so if you look at that slide let me get to the slide number eight that shows you the two royalty wells that we have on sky ranch i mean there is a total of maybe  wells in the field unidentified analyst okay mark w harding and our two royalty wells weve got  acres of the property reserve one that’s one quarter section where we have a royalty interest and then  acres of the royalty section in the sky ranch well so each of those  acre interest unidentified analyst at least the ones that go into production in february mark w harding yes unidentified analyst when will you know the amount of the royalty checks mark w harding probably when i get them i really don’t have a feel for that process yet just because were still new that process i am assuming that as they complete those and those come online those are based on days of production that they will report and then we get a royalty computation based on what they sell that product for unidentified analyst okay all right the permits that are being requested how long is a permit good for mark w harding they are actually – i think they are good for  year with a  year extension so call it  years unidentified analyst so even though people are not drilling now they are still going to the permitting process which gives them  years to actually stick some metal on the ground mark w harding i think that true i mean what they want to do and i do know that it’s been a little – they have had a little longer lead time on some of the permitting then they have in other areas of operations so what they want to do is get an inventory of permits available so that they can be more aggressive and be more efficient about how they are attacking the field unidentified analyst okay the capex for fiscal  what is your current expectation of total capex mark w harding its  million unidentified analyst pardon mark w harding  million unidentified analyst  million in total mark w harding yes unidentified analyst and virtually of that is for wise project mark w harding correct yes unidentified analyst there is very little other than wise mark w harding that’s correct very little other than wise unidentified analyst okay on the sky ranch development would you expect to make a firm decision in – calendar of    what kind of timeframe are we looking at mark w harding great question and i wish i had some more specificity to it based on the conversations that weve got going i am fairly bullish about our  clarity but ive successfully predicted that for the last  years the market continues to grow well jeff and i think it really does given the level of interest i think there is some opportunity for us to be more specific about that i just don’t know if i got a sense of where and how that’s all going to come together unidentified analyst okay you have one main driller how many other drillers do you talk to about their activities in the niobrara mark w harding so there is basically three one main but we have basically three lease hold interest areas within our area of influence… unidentified analyst yes mark w harding and so we have talked with two of the three in that and you know its pretty similar story they – it is a price per barrel function it is necessarily taking a look at lining our permits and making sure that all the regulatory stuff that they need to get done are done and available to them so i think a consistent story that – its not – has nothing to do with the field or the attractiveness of the field that has everything to do with the price of oil unidentified analyst the latest baker ph used drill count shows that the activity in niobrara is down from  rigs working down to  it doesn’t show any huge drop is that kind of what youve been seeing mark w harding i think that’s consistent if we take a look at it from the northern field and what i would say most of the press coming out of the niobrara formation has been that they will drill the same number of wells they are not going to expand the number of wells that they are looking at yearoveryear where they may have had some expansions where they may have gone from  rigs to  rigs that’s not going to happen i now at least our main operator has released the one rig that they have but they also have the ability to bring that back or bring multiple rigs back to pick later in the year or pick up in  so i think its going to be everybody is going to look at sort of a steady state of whats going on in the core wattenberg field well see what happens with our operator in sort of the southern wattenberg field but nothing seems to be catastrophic now i am learning about the oil and gas business were water company but it is an important component or has been an important component for us and it’s very interesting and weve got plenty of capacity that we can provide water to this – for this particular function in a water short area i mean that’s – water happens to be one of the critical elements in this field to be able to secure and so i think we have demonstrated our capacities to a very high degree of success with a great deal of success for the operators that are working in the field so well see how the price of oil influences much of that capex we try and look at though quarteroverquarter but maybe you know how does target a range in the next  to  years and i think it looks very attractive for us and while may see some of that decline in our third and fourth quarters were also going to see new source of revenue being royalty revenue so were still very bullish about our overall profitability for  unidentified analyst all right for the november quarter how many drilling wells were you supplying with water during that three months of quarter mark w harding we just had the one rig working so i think there was  maybe  wells were running about a  a well given the water deliveries per well that  to  million gallons of well unidentified analyst okay and so your – but there is no drill operating as of today mark w harding right and we still have about  more wells to frac so our q will look very similar to our q unidentified analyst and q will drop off if there is no activity initiated mark w harding yes you are likely to see pick up in royalty revenue in q unidentified analyst yes okay thanks very much mark w harding yes operator our next question comes from david indiscernible your line is open unidentified analyst hey mark how youre doing mark w harding i am great david good to hear your voice unidentified analyst yes i am sort of getting back in the suite of things here a little bit i mean you alluded to this a little bit and i know you guys have done a lot of things over the last years to kind of diversify the story a little bit but i am still kind of interested in your view of just of sort of the  foot ph view i mean i think that the narrative for the long time and the story was really just kind of just deep water value in a really place where water was likely to become more and more scarce and i guess ive always looked at the company from that perspective but if go the other things youre doing there great but is that – you still view that near to this is – as you know largely intact i mean that notion that you have this company that controls a great deal of water in a place where water is likely to become more and more scarce and ultimately more and more valuable is that still is that nearer to still apply here in spite of all the diversifications some of the other things that youre doing mark w harding it really does i mean our genealogy the core of the company continues to be a water utility company that we – i think we did very well on some acquisitions we know we did very well with the land acquisition on sky ranch that vertically integrated ourselves the property is a very attractive piece of property its located in a great spot has an interchange right up the interstate and we acquired that and are really for to at as time that said not a lot of people were buying raw land in that timeframe so it worked well for us in terms of the opportunities that we now have on the land development side but it really was a fundamental utility acquisition we were protecting our utility franchise on that because anybody that was going to pick up the land was going to pick up the benefit of our utility and there was no value of that utility in the land value when it was in bankruptcy so while we have youre exactly right i mean the company has exactly focused on some of those diversifications whether that was diversify way from a core dependency on having another water provider take actions we know we still are a wholesale water provider and are working on relationships where we can provide also water service to a number of different communities by picking up some raw land and being able to control the timing of development of that raw land more consistent with the market principles and the market went soft on us but at the end of the day the market is very robust in the denver as you know and then the oil and gas opportunity was terrific for us because it was a very large customer where we were able to expand our facilities and we did so in coordinated way where we didn’t over extend ourselves provided additional capacity to those oil and gas enterprises that were very attractive for them they needed it to be able to explore this interest i think theyve verified it and then the price of oil went out so that diversification still hold and will still be very attractive for us in the long run but if you look at how we look at the world we look at the world through water utility focus that always been our focus we haven’t acquired oil and gas interest we haven’t acquired real estate interest were the fact that those are diversification those all had to have threads of our water utility business and the acquisition of the wise project is a classic example of us continuing down that path where were getting infrastructure and not only are we have a healthy and very long portfolio of water on a ship which you alluded to but were increasing our opportunities for infrastructure to be able to deliver that to a number of different areas and that have pipeline capacity and all of the attractive things that we want to do to an enterprise so as opposed to having this huge and valuable portfolio of water ownership which continue to be the case now were bolting on that by being able to have ways that we can monetize that not only for our direct utility opportunities but then also commercial opportunities for industrial water sales and other areas so it is exactly that youve got your nail on it and i think it’s – our fundamentals continue to be exactly the utility franchise that we have unidentified analyst and there is no particular reason to believe that the water issues that have plagued the eastern slope for how ever long that those are any less acute today then theyve ever been mark w harding no i mean they may have been deferred for a period of time just because of the weakening in the real estate market but there is just – at some price if you look at it at some price if you are on a costal area there is a water supply available we just don’t have that options here there is no additional new water that’s available and you have to reach further and further away where we have go on the west slope or where we have to continue to reach further and further away for agriculture water right those are the – there is no unallocated water in the city of colorado its all spoken for year and anybody that’s looking at increasing water supplies are in the competitive market of buying existing water rights so i think it’s going to continue to increase in value unidentified analyst perfect thanks a lot mark w harding you bet thanks for the question operator operator instructions our next question comes from elliot knight with knight advisors ph your line is open unidentified analyst hi mark mark w harding hi elliot unidentified analyst its time to drop down from  suite to ground level mark w harding okay unidentified analyst you commented you mentioned two names wattenberg and south wattenberg and first question is in talking with people in the industry answer was north of the drilling done so far are these two separate fields or are they or is really just one big field mark w harding that’s a good question elliot unidentified analyst well let me tell you why i am asking because the follow on is if they are two separate fields then the next question is are there any differences in the production characteristics the decline of the wells in wattenberg versus the south wattenberg area that’s where the question is growing mark w harding yes that’s – and it’s a really spot light my deficiencies and understanding oil and gas in a laymans term you know i always look at the niobrara as a singular shale deposit and it was created by a marine deposit and so all of colorado was a marine see floor and so i think of this as a niobrara being uniform formation whether that’s in the wattenberg field or the southern wattenberg field that said i do know that there are areas that are better produces than others and i don’t know why that necessarily is the case and i would even presume even within the field that we have that there are probably wells that are producing than others i don’t know if that’s because they continue to tweak how they are drilling how they are completing what the orientation is what the type of water they use for frac or what the formulae is for the frac probably all of those are variables in completing any given well into the field that will tell you whether the decline curve is consistent with what the operators are seeing across the niobrara deposits or otherwise so i want to say its based on that level of my understanding and you probably have a better understanding as a recovered oil and gas analyst that it is the same type of formation and the geography of the field is really only to orientate to as where one particular operator is versus another unidentified analyst well what i don’t know and what i am thinking about is what you may hear sort of as settle but from people as anybody says hey the wells down here are very indiscernible around up in the one verdict or the better or they are not quite as good that’s really where i was going if they are not what you say about its being one field deposits – the depositions certainly makes good sense mark w harding got it and i am going to say it’s a consistent field than the results are going to be from an operators art in being able to drill and complete and that sort of stuff unidentified analyst okay so there was no reason to expect any difference in the natural decline it has to be pretty rapid mark w harding yes i think so and i guess well the more wells you get the more information you get so that probably will continue to define itself as we get more specificity into this location versus maybe things that are few miles north of us unidentified analyst okay let me just offer one observation because yes i did use to be an oil analyst the first royalty check that comes in there maybe a temptation to be disappointed in it because the chance was of it being less than a four months share of the production are pretty good mark w harding yes unidentified analyst so we just need to take that first months check with a grain of salt i think mark w harding yes and ultimately of might be of how they report that as this how many days of operation that sort of stuff but having never participated in that i am yet to – yet to understand how that will actually come to us unidentified analyst yes well when you talk about it if you put it on the days of production and may check through it then i think… mark w harding yes… unidentified analyst will refer to everybody… mark w harding just because everybody has the same data points unidentified analyst yes right mark w harding that’s good unidentified analyst thank you sir mark w harding yes unidentified analyst that’s all mark w harding thank you operator our next question comes from robert kirkpatrick with cardinal capital your line is open robert b kirkpatrick hi mark mark w harding hi rob robert b kirkpatrick could you talk about the prosper community which is located and has been i guess approved by various indiscernible that’s going to be located adjacent to sky ranch mark w harding yes so that’s an assemblage i think it’s about  acres assemblage directly east of where were at and so what they are looking at doing is getting a land used application similar to ours as where it’s a preliminary development plan where they are looking at having a number of different types of development whether that’s residential really a mixed used development it has residential commercial retail all the same elements that we have it’s about twice the size of what were looking at sky ranch they have a quite a bit more acreage but about the actual development is about twice the size of sky ranch and theyve been working away to the process we look at that as a very favorable addition because it continues to drive interest it’s for east of us so logically speaking if the metropolitan area grows from west to east as it has historically that continues to demonstrate demand for the market so again is another opportunity for us its an opportunity we certainly would like to work with them on the water issues they still need water service and so we have been discussions with them about opportunities for water availability they are developer they have developed some retail space and commercial space so if there an opportunity for us to find a relationship with them on the development side so there is a number of joint opportunities that that particular development may per trend for us but still very early on in the process i think ill get there they will get their zoning probably some time this month on that and then well see where they want to head with that but that’s as much as i know about it robert b kirkpatrick great thank you so much mark w harding you bet operator i am showing no further questions id like to hand the call back to mark harding for closing remarks end of qa mark w harding okay i do want to thank you all again really over time of the call here as i just wanted to bring everybody current on some of the moving targets that we have whether that was some of the activity on the oil gas side we do look at some of the pull back on that relative to the number of wells that will be drilled in  but still feel that  will continue to demonstrate our trend towards profitability so were very excited about that we want to continue to emphasize our water utility operations and that we will continue to grow and develop that business as one of the calls earlier we are water utility company and that continues to be our primary focus and denver continues to be one of the best areas to be one of those companies and have a long portfolio of water that you can put to beneficial use and really opportunities for us are in the expansion of infrastructure and so weve got a couple of very exciting opportunities that have come to fruition after couple of years of work that were very excited about so if you didn’t get a call or if you didn’t get the chance to ask a question or you didn’t want to ask on the call certainly don’t hesitate to give me a shout happy to give you what ever insights that we have with the company and what were doing but thank you again for your continued support and we will continue to keep you apprised operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in todays conference this
