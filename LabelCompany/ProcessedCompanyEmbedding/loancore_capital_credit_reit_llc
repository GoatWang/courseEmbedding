acquisition of attractive investment opportunities we compete with a variety of institutional investors including other reits specialty finance companies savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies mutual funds institutional investors investment banking firms financial institutions governmental bodies and other entities and may compete with other loancore vehicles many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do several of our competitors have recently raised or are expected to raise significant amounts of capital and may have investment objectives that overlap with our investment objectives which may create additional competition for our target assets some of our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us or are only available to us on substantially less attractive terms many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with reit tax compliance or maintenance of an exclusion or exemption from the investment company act in addition some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more lending relationships than we do competition may result in fewer investments higher prices acceptance of greater risk lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs in addition competition for attractive investments could delay the investment of our capital in the face of this competition we have access to our manager’s professionals through loancore and their industry expertise which may provide us with a competitive advantage in competing effectively for attractive investment opportunities and help us assess risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential investments however we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face company description we are a commercial real estate finance company that originates invests in and manages commercial mortgage
