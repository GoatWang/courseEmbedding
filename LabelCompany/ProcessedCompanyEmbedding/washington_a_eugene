as the kalapuyans also written calapooia or calapooya they made seasonal rounds moving around the countryside as appropriate to collect and preserve local foods including acorns the bulbs of the wapato and camas plants and berries they stored these foods in their permanent winter village when crop activities waned they returned to their winter villages and took up hunting fishing and trading  they were known as the chifin kalapuyans and called the eugene area where they lived chifin sometimes recorded as chafin or chiffin  camas flower other kalapuyan tribes occupied villages that are also now within eugene city limits peeyou or mohawk calapooians winefelly or pleasant hill calapooians and the lungtum or long tom they were closeneighbors to the chifin intermarried and were political allies some authorities suggest that the brownsville kalapuyans calapooia kalapuyans were related to the peeyou it is likely that since the santiam had an alliance with the brownsville kalapuyans that the santiam influence also went as far at eugene according to archeological evidence the ancestors of the kalapuyans may have been in eugene for as long as  years in the s their traditional way of life faced significant changes due to devastating epidemics and settlement first by french fur traders and later by an overwhelming number of united states colonists colonial arrival and impactedit

year later the willamette valley natives traced the arrival of the disease then new to the northwest to the us ship owyhee captained by john dominis intermittent fever is thought by researchers now to

recorded history of what would eventually become the state of oregon in his book the coming of the spirit pestilence boyd reports that there was a  population loss for the kalapuyans between  and  this catastrophic event shattered the social fabric of kalapuyan society and altered the demographic balance in the valley this balance was further altered over the next few years by the arrival of angloamerican settlers beginning in  with  people and growing exponentially each year until within  years more than  us colonists including eugene skinner had arrived as the demographic pressure from the colonists grew the remaining kalapuyans were forcibly removed to indian reservations though some natives escaped being swept into the reservation most were moved to the grand ronde reservation in  strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people known as métis in french had to make a choice between the reservation and anglo society native americans could not leave the reservation without traveling papers and white people could not enter the reservation eugene skinneredit replica of skinners original cabin eugene franklin skinner after whom eugene is named arrived in the

were known as the kalapuyans also written calapooia or calapooya they made seasonal rounds moving around the countryside as appropriate to collect and preserve local foods including acorns the bulbs of the wapato and camas plants and berries they stored these foods in their permanent winter village when crop activities waned they returned to their winter villages and took up hunting fishing and trading  they were known as the chifin kalapuyans and called the eugene area where they lived chifin sometimes recorded as chafin or chiffin  camas flower other kalapuyan tribes occupied villages that are also now within eugene city limits peeyou or mohawk calapooians winefelly or pleasant hill calapooians and the lungtum or long tom they were closeneighbors to the chifin intermarried and were political allies some authorities suggest that the brownsville kalapuyans calapooia kalapuyans were related to the peeyou it is likely that since the santiam had an alliance with the brownsville kalapuyans that the santiam influence also went as far at eugene according to archeological evidence the ancestors of the kalapuyans may have been in eugene for as long as  years in the s their traditional way of life faced significant changes due to devastating epidemics and settlement first by french fur traders and later by an overwhelming number of united states colonists colonial arrival and impactedit kalapuya man circa  french fur traders had settled seasonally in the willamette valley by the beginning of the th century having already developed relationships with native communities through intermarriage and trade they negotiated for land from the kalapuyans by  to  they and their native wives began yearround occupation of the land raising crops and tending animals in this process the mixed race families began to impact native access to land food supply and traditional materials for trade and religious practices in july  intermittent fever struck the lower columbia region and a year later the willamette valley natives traced the arrival of the disease then new to the northwest to the us ship owyhee captained by john dominis intermittent fever is thought by researchers now to be malaria according to robert t boyd an anthropologist at portland state university the first three years of the epidemic probably constitute the single most important epidemiological event in the recorded history of what would eventually become the state of oregon in his book the coming of the spirit pestilence boyd reports that there was a  population loss for the kalapuyans between  and  this catastrophic event shattered the social fabric of kalapuyan society and altered the demographic balance in the valley this balance was further altered over the next few years by the arrival of angloamerican settlers beginning in  with  people and growing exponentially each year until within  years more than  us colonists including eugene skinner had arrived as the demographic pressure from the colonists grew the remaining kalapuyans were forcibly removed to indian reservations though some natives escaped being swept into the reservation most were moved to the grand ronde reservation in  strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people known as métis in french had to make a choice between the reservation and anglo society native americans could

were known as the kalapuyans also written calapooia or calapooya they made seasonal rounds moving around the countryside as appropriate to collect and preserve local foods including acorns the bulbs of the wapato and camas plants and berries they stored these foods in their permanent winter village when crop activities waned they returned to their winter villages and took up hunting fishing and trading  they were known as the chifin kalapuyans and called the eugene area where they lived chifin sometimes recorded as chafin or chiffin  camas flower other kalapuyan tribes occupied villages that are also now within eugene city limits peeyou or mohawk calapooians winefelly or pleasant hill calapooians and the lungtum or long tom they were closeneighbors to the chifin intermarried and were political allies some authorities suggest that the brownsville kalapuyans calapooia kalapuyans were related to the peeyou it is likely that since the santiam had an alliance with the brownsville kalapuyans that the santiam influence also went as far at eugene according to archeological evidence the ancestors of the kalapuyans may have been in eugene for as long as  years in the s their traditional way of life faced significant changes due to devastating epidemics and settlement first by french fur traders and later by an overwhelming number of united states colonists colonial arrival and impactedit kalapuya man circa  french fur traders had settled seasonally in the willamette valley by the beginning of the th century having already developed relationships with native communities through intermarriage and trade they negotiated for land from the kalapuyans by  to  they and their native wives began yearround occupation of the land raising crops and tending animals in this process the mixed race families began to impact native access to land food supply and traditional materials for trade and religious practices in july  intermittent fever struck the lower columbia region and a year later the willamette valley natives traced the arrival of the disease then new to the northwest to the us ship owyhee captained by john dominis intermittent fever is thought by researchers now to be malaria according to robert t boyd an anthropologist at portland state university the first three years of the epidemic probably constitute the single most important epidemiological event in the recorded history of what would eventually become the state of oregon in his book the coming of the spirit pestilence boyd reports that there was a  population loss for the kalapuyans between  and  this catastrophic event shattered the social fabric of kalapuyan society and altered the demographic balance in the valley this balance was further altered over the next few years by the arrival of angloamerican settlers beginning in  with  people and growing exponentially each year until within  years more than  us colonists including eugene skinner had arrived as the demographic pressure from the colonists grew the remaining kalapuyans were forcibly removed to indian reservations though some natives escaped being swept into the reservation most were moved to the grand ronde reservation in  strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people known as métis in french had to make a choice between the reservation and anglo society native americans could not leave the reservation without traveling papers and white people could not enter the reservation eugene skinneredit replica of skinners original cabin eugene franklin skinner after whom eugene is named arrived in the willamette valley in  with  other colonists that year advised by the kalapuyans to build on high ground to avoid flooding he erected the first anglo cabin on south or west slope of what the kalapuyans called yapoah the isolated hill is now known as skinners butte the cabin was used as a trading post and was registered as an official post office on january   at this time the

were known as the kalapuyans also written calapooia or calapooya they made seasonal rounds moving around the countryside as appropriate to collect and preserve local foods including acorns the bulbs of the wapato and camas plants and berries they stored these foods in their permanent winter village when crop activities waned they returned to their winter villages and took up hunting fishing and trading  they were known as the chifin kalapuyans and called the eugene area where they lived chifin sometimes recorded as chafin or chiffin  camas flower other kalapuyan tribes occupied villages that are also now within eugene city limits peeyou or mohawk calapooians winefelly or pleasant hill calapooians and the lungtum or long tom they were closeneighbors to the chifin intermarried and were political allies some authorities suggest that the brownsville kalapuyans calapooia kalapuyans were related to the peeyou it is likely that since the santiam had an alliance with the brownsville kalapuyans that the santiam influence also went as far at eugene according to archeological evidence the ancestors of the kalapuyans may have been in eugene for as long as  years in the s their traditional way of life faced significant changes due to devastating epidemics and settlement first by french fur traders and later by an overwhelming number of united states colonists colonial arrival and impactedit kalapuya man circa  french fur traders had settled seasonally in the willamette valley by the beginning of the th century having already developed relationships with native communities through intermarriage and trade they negotiated for land from the kalapuyans by  to  they and their native wives began yearround occupation of the land raising crops and tending animals in this process the mixed race families began to impact native access to land food supply and traditional materials for trade and religious practices in july  intermittent fever struck the lower columbia region and a year later the willamette valley natives traced the arrival of the disease then new to the northwest to the us ship owyhee captained by john dominis intermittent fever is thought by researchers now to be malaria according to robert t boyd an anthropologist at portland state university the first three years of the epidemic probably constitute the single most important epidemiological event in the recorded history of what would eventually become the state of oregon in his book the coming of the spirit pestilence boyd reports that there was a  population loss for the kalapuyans between  and  this catastrophic event shattered the social fabric of kalapuyan society and altered the demographic balance in the valley this balance was further altered over the next few years by the arrival of angloamerican settlers beginning in  with  people and growing exponentially each year until within  years more than  us colonists including eugene skinner had arrived as the demographic pressure from the colonists grew the remaining kalapuyans were forcibly removed to indian reservations though some natives escaped being swept into the reservation most were moved to the grand ronde reservation in  strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people known as métis in french had to make a choice between the reservation and anglo society native americans could not leave the reservation without traveling papers and white people could not enter the reservation eugene skinneredit replica of skinners original cabin eugene franklin skinner after whom eugene is named arrived in the willamette valley in  with  other colonists that year advised by the kalapuyans to build on high ground to avoid flooding he erected the first anglo cabin on south or west slope of what the kalapuyans called yapoah the isolated hill is now known as skinners butte the cabin was used as a trading post and was registered as an official post office on january   at this time the settlement was known by anglos as skinners mudhole it was relocated in  and named eugene city in  formally incorporated as a city in  it was named simply eugene in  skinner ran a ferry service across the willamette river where the ferry street bridge now stands educational institutionsedit the first major educational institution in the area was columbia college founded a few years earlier than the university of oregon it fell victim to two major fires in four years and after the second fire the college decided not to rebuild again the part of south eugene known as college hill was the former location of columbia college there is no college there today the town raised the initial funding to start a public university which later became the university of oregon with the hope of turning the small town into a center of learning in  the legislative assembly passed a bill creating the university of oregon as a state institution eugene bested the nearby town of albany in the competition for

during height of wildfire season van burns in eugene parking lot as acetylene tanks explode  charged after filming public officials’ homes in portland   olympia — measures to tax vapor ecigarettes and other nicotine products are being considered by lawmakers in washington state a bill in the house proposes treating vapor products and ecigarettes like tobacco products where distributors are generally taxed at  percent of the wholesale price another measure proposes a  percent tax in many areas of the state consumers on average pay a  percent sales tax rate on vapor products but if the measures pass customers in turn will see a markup under the higher proposed rate consumers could pay closer to  percent in “other tobacco product” taxes not including retail sales tax which would be added to the shelf price public hearings for the bills are scheduled for next week “this tax is something these companies should have been paying all along” said democratic rep gerry pollet sponsor of house bill  “they’ve gotten off scotfree for years while causing incredible damage to people’s health in the state” pollet who also teaches public health at the university of washington says people are being “tricked” into thinking vapor products are safer than cigarettes he said they could be “marginally” better in comparison to regular cigarettes but still can contain harmful chemicals “unlike cigarettes that destroy your lungs slowly vapor products and e­cigarettes can contain diacetyl which is a chemical that acts rapidly and destroys the inside of people’s lungs” he said a study published in  in the journal environmental health perspectives found that harmful chemicals associated with “popcorn lung” are present in many types of flavored ecigarettes particularly those with flavors like fruit and candy which pollet says is how companies attract young users of  flavored ecigarettes tested diacetyl was found in  samples and  contained flavoring chemicals mary mchale of the american cancer society cancer action network said the cause for concern aside from not really knowing the longterm effects of these products is the “sharp increase” in use among youth in washington and nationally according to the centers for disease control and prevention during  to  ecigarette use among high school students rose from  percent to  percent and among middle school students from  percent to  percent however ecigarette and vapor product use dropped about five percentage points among thgraders from  to  in washington according to a  survey “it’s really startling when you look at how many young people use these products” she said “i think it’s been ingrained in them that tobacco products are bad but when you ask them about ecigarettes they view them largely as harmless and that’s a really big problem” vaporizers are typically more customizable and offer a variety of different flavors including strawberry tobacco and even fried ice cream vapes generally also last longer and hold more liquid than ecigarettes which are usually prefilled in cartons and are sold at gas stations or other convenient stores both do not contain tobacco but can contain nicotine zach mclain  the owner of future vapor in seattle said he opposes the tax for many reasons he said his business and hundreds alike would be “destroyed” if the tax passed the legislature “there’s no doubt we’ll have to close our doors” he said “nobody will be able to afford the products they’ll find them online somewhere or figure out another source where they’re cheaper” more northwest articles »     rg

they made seasonal rounds moving around the countryside as appropriate to collect and preserve local foods including acorns the bulbs of the wapato and camas plants and berries they stored these foods in their permanent winter village when crop activities waned they returned to their winter villages and took up hunting fishing and trading  they were known as the chifin kalapuyans and called the eugene area where they lived chifin sometimes recorded as chafin or chiffin  camas flower other kalapuyan tribes occupied villages that are also now within eugene city limits peeyou or mohawk calapooians winefelly or pleasant hill calapooians and the lungtum or long tom they were closeneighbors to the chifin intermarried and were political allies some authorities suggest that the brownsville kalapuyans calapooia kalapuyans were related to the peeyou it is likely that since the santiam had an alliance with the brownsville kalapuyans that the santiam influence also went as far at eugene according to archeological evidence the ancestors of the kalapuyans may have been in eugene for as long as  years in the s their traditional way of life faced significant changes due to devastating epidemics and settlement first by french fur traders and later by an overwhelming number of united states colonists colonial arrival and impactedit kalapuya man circa  french fur traders had settled seasonally in the willamette valley by the beginning of the th century having already developed relationships with native communities through intermarriage and trade they negotiated for land from the kalapuyans by  to  they and their native wives began yearround occupation of the land raising crops and tending animals in this process the mixed race families began to impact native access to land food supply and traditional materials for trade and religious practices in july  intermittent fever struck the lower columbia region and a year later the willamette valley natives traced the arrival of the disease then new to the northwest to the us ship owyhee captained by john dominis intermittent fever is thought by researchers now to be malaria according to robert t boyd an anthropologist at portland state university the first three years of the epidemic probably constitute the single most important epidemiological event in the recorded history of what would eventually become the state of oregon in his book the coming of the spirit pestilence boyd reports that there was a  population loss for the kalapuyans between  and  this catastrophic event shattered the social fabric of kalapuyan society and altered the demographic balance in the valley this balance was further altered over the next few years by the arrival of angloamerican settlers beginning in  with  people and growing exponentially each year until within  years more than  us colonists including eugene skinner had arrived as the demographic pressure from the colonists grew the remaining kalapuyans were forcibly removed to indian reservations though some natives escaped being swept into the reservation most were moved to the grand ronde reservation in  strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people known as métis in french had to make a choice between the reservation and anglo society native americans could not leave the reservation without traveling papers and white people could not enter the reservation eugene skinneredit replica of skinners original cabin eugene franklin skinner after whom eugene is named arrived in the willamette valley in  with  other colonists that year advised by the kalapuyans to build on high ground to avoid flooding he erected the first anglo cabin on south or west slope of what the kalapuyans called yapoah the isolated hill is now known as skinners butte the cabin was used as a trading post and was registered as an official post office on january   at this time the settlement was known by anglos as skinners mudhole it was relocated in  and named eugene city in  formally incorporated as a city in  it was named simply eugene in  skinner ran a ferry service across the willamette river where the ferry street bridge now stands educational institutionsedit the first major educational institution in the area was columbia college founded a few years earlier than the university of oregon it fell victim to two major fires in four years and after the second fire the college decided not to rebuild again the part of south eugene known as college hill was the former location of columbia college there is no college there today

they love but almost everyone has one they hate from flight delays and cramped seats to bad customer service and lost luggage airlines have a terrible reputation in survey after survey the airline industry ranks somewhere below most insurance sectors and only slightly above the cable television industry airlines are to put it simply not exactly adored but is that reputation earned or is it just a perception perhaps an airline returned your suitcase two days late and missing three wheels so you vowed never to travel with them again but in any system where millions of passengers are transported on tens of thousands of flights each day in the us alone a few bad incidents are unavoidable so does your personal experience reflect the overall state of that particular airline or did you just get unlucky and catch it on a bad day we set out to answer this quandary — by looking at the numbers while most “best of” airline rankings rely on customer surveys or reader polls we wanted to study objective data is your airline really always late or only when you happen to arrive two hours early at the airport are the seats measurably terrible or do they just feel that way after six hours of fidgeting on them and most importantly is your airline really nickelanddiming you to death with unnecessary fees or are the costs offset by its competitively lower ticket prices to compile our report we assembled data from sources across the industry we scrutinized thousands of pages of government reports and corporate financial statements we chose criteria based on what we believe regular passengers care about most and if you disagree with our choices we’re even giving you the chance to reweight our criteria yourself in this post the candidates we adore international travel here at the points guy — meeting people from other cultures encourages a better understanding of humanity and of ourselves we encourage everyone to get out of their comfort zone and take a trip outside the us at least once and preferably often but we also know that less than half of all americans have a passport which means the majority of people will only experience air travel on flights within the united states therefore we elected to study domestic airlines — or in the case of large airlines to differentiate their domestic operations from their international ones we also wanted to restrict our study to airlines that most people would have a decent chance of flying there may be regional operators with excellent reputations but if their only route is nantucket to martha’s vineyard most americans are never going to experience that service so our report encompasses the ten largest airlines as measured by the number of domestic passengers and excluding regional carriers who partner with one or more of the airlines we were unable to include allegiant air in our study since it was not possible to obtain enough data to accurately rank the airline our list of contenders is as follows while alaska and virgin america have completed their merger transaction at this time they are still operating as two separate airlines so we kept them separate in our rankings the criteria it’s a wellknown truism of the airline industry that the overwhelming majority of flyers book airline tickets based on two factors — price and convenience so in developing our criteria —  themes across four major categories — we wanted to make sure those two factors got the greatest weight when it comes to price the actual cost of an airline ticket is now only a portion of the final cost for travelers given the explosion in ancillary fees in recent years we’re thinking about baggage and change fees in particular so we accounted for both airfare and fees in our calculations for convenience the more cities and routes an airline serves the more options a customer has for getting the shortest flight at the best time of day but the ontime arrival rate and the features of an airplane cabin — such as onboard wifi — are elements of convenience as well of course just because price and convenience are primary factors doesn’t mean we ignored the rest of what makes up an airline operation after much consideration we identified the following  criteria in four broad categories — price convenience headaches and extras — and weighted them as follows the methodology once we had our candidates and our criteria we set about finding ways to measure it all for some elements this was extremely straightforward statistics on lost baggage and involuntary bumps being denied boarding not turbulence are reported by the department of transportation dot on a monthly basis so in those cases it was just a matter of looking up the data other criteria were a little harder to find airlines don’t like to tell the general public how much we’re spending on airfare but they love telling investors how much money they’re collecting in fact there’s a standard measure in the industry known as “passenger yield per mile” that metric is calculated by dividing the amount of passenger revenue an airline has collected from tickets by the number of passengers and then again by the number of miles flown the final result tells investors how much an airline gets paid in cents per customer per mile for investors the higher this number the better but a higher number means passengers are paying more or to put it more simply passenger yield is how much you the customer are paying on average in airfare for each mile you fly passenger yield is reported by airlines on a quarterly basis to the bureau of transportation statistics bts which puts the info into an online public database called transtats that same database also contains legally required reports on baggage and change fees collected by each airline and the database can be filtered by domestic or worldwide performance so thanks to the bts we were able to assemble all the data we needed on price in just one place then came a few tricky items most people know the department of transportation also collects statistics for ontime arrivals but delayed flights and cancelled flights are two different animals fortunately a company called oag compiles an annual report known as the punctuality league which combines delays and cancellations for over  million flights worldwide to arrive at an overall “on time” figure for each airline customer satisfaction is by its nature a subjective judgment made by customers but customer complaints are an objective way to measure it the dot maintains records of the customer complaints it receives each month across a dozen topics including customer service flight problems and refunds it’s a selfselecting data set as it only reflects people who took the time to file a complaint with the dot but it’s an applestoapples comparison across all our airlines while it wasn’t difficult to count the number of lounges for each of our airlines by city and airport and determine the daily and annual cost to get into them calculating the size of each airline’s route network was a bit more complicated since most airlines report their number of cities routes and frequencies on a worldwide basis but oliver wyman planestats makes it easy to filter origin and destination od data from the bts by region which let us calculate the size of our airlines’ networks using domestic cities only finally there were the tough nuts to crack cabin comfort includes a ton of variables — seat size onboard food inflight wifi plus dozens of others that can be difficult to compress into one overall number for each flight let alone an entire airline however one company does exactly that the routehappy public database provides an overall rating on cabin comfort for any specific flight that meant it was up to us to decide which flights to search for in the end we chose to look up the average flight ratings for the  most traveled domestic routes on each of the  airlines which we then distilled into one overall score per airline for ranking purposes and how could a site called the points guy do an airline study without including frequent flyer programs given the breadth and complexity of mileage programs we could easily write an entire report about this one criterion alone and we might just do that at some point but to keep things simple we used our existing tpg monthly point valuations along with our tpg elite status valuations to arrive at an overall score for each airline’s loyalty program a few technical notes all data in this report is from calendar year  unless noted and was normalized for the number of passengers traveling on each airline we also restricted our data set to domestic numbers only except when separating the domestic data from the worldwide data was impossible raw data totals for each criteria were converted to a simple  to  scale with  at the top and  at the bottom since there are  airlines and  criteria a theoretically perfect airline would score  the results and now the moment we’ve all been waiting for… here are the  domestic airlines from best to worst the top and bottom of these rankings aren’t terribly surprising alaska is known to run a very good airline and it shows as the airline placed in the top  in more than half our criteria — airfare ontime arrivals lost baggage involuntary bumps customer satisfaction and its frequent flyer program the only real knock against alaska is the size of its route network but that problem will be partially alleviated as alaska’s merger with virgin america — which also ranked well in our survey based on airfare cabin comfort lost baggage and involuntary bumps — is implemented over the next few years if alaska can retain its high quality and incorporate virgin america’s strengths while expanding it’s going to be a fierce competitor on the other end of our rankings many folks don’t like spirit and it appears they have good reason to feel that way the lowcost carrier finished dead last in four different criteria — ontime arrivals customer satisfaction cabin comfort and its frequent flyer program — and second to last in another unsurprisingly its baggage and change fees the one thing spirit’s got going for it cheap airfares it led the pack in that area frontier suffered a similar fate as it was second to last in many of the same areas in which spirit finished last but finished second from the top when it comes to airfare but what about some of these other results united coming in second may surprise some people especially since the carrier didn’t win outright in any particular area however it performed solidly in a number of our criteria including route network cabin comfort baggage and change fees and lounges and didn’t finish worse than middle of the pack on any measure though it could use some improvement in customer satisfaction put it all together and united wins the silver this year the biggest shock to most people will likely be seeing delta in seventh place delta has built a reputation over the last several years for running an excellent airline operation and when we dive deeper into the numbers it’s clear that reputation is warranted delta finished in the top  in almost all the performance criteria including ontime arrivals customer satisfaction involuntary bumps lounges and the overall size of the airline so why did delta fare so poorly in the final rankings simple — it’s expensive delta finished last in the airfare criterion which meant lots of revenue for delta but less money in customers’ pockets and delta also charges significant fees as well while some other airlines offset their higher fares with lower ancillary fees southwest is an excellent example of an airline with low baggage and change fees although it has higher airfares than most people realize and no premium class seats which hurt its cabin comfort score finally jetblue hovered somewhere between the top and the middle of the pack as it scored well on baggage and change fees cabin comfort and customer satisfaction but received low marks for ontime arrivals and involuntary bumps american sits right in the middle of our rankings — it has the largest route network of any airline but got poor scores for customer satisfaction lost baggage and involuntary bumps and while hawaiian was the most ontime airline in our study it has the smallest route network relatively high airfares lounges in hawaii only partner lounges did not count for any airlines in our study and a middling frequent flyer program which relegated it to eighth place overall those are the facts but we also wanted to take a look at consumer survey results from market research company jd power whose  jd power north america airline satisfaction study is highly regarded when it comes to studying the opinions of airline customers the survey shows how customers perceived airlines in  but how do those perceptions stand up to our objective look at the data here’s a comparative look jd power does not include spirit hawaiian or virgin america in its survey it does include the canadian carriers westjet  and air canada  which are not shown for the purposes of this comparison courtesy jd power and associates when compared to our data united is ranked much lower by customers and southwest is regarded more highly but the rest of the airlines are within a couple of ranks across both studies it’s your turn but what if you don’t agree with us or with the average consumer perhaps you’re willing to pay more for better cabin comfort or you’ll fly on a less convenient airline if its frequent flyer program is superior everyone has different priorities and we wanted to give tpg readers a chance to draw their own conclusions so we’ve put together a tool that lets you decide how much to weight each of our  criteria pick your own percentages across the categories and the tool will recalculate the results based on your choices and our data for instance if you don’t care about baggage and change fees you can weight it less than the  we chose and emphasize something else with the extra percentage points or if frequent flyer programs are extremely important to you push that criteria up as far as you’d like… but remember that the overall percentages must add up to  so it’s up to you to pick and choose what you want prioritized and deprioritized ampampampampampampampamplta href’’ampampampampampampampampgtampampampampampampampampltimg alt’the best and worst airlines in

convenience customer satisfaction and perks like lounges and meaningful loyalty programs and while price means a lot to most people having the lowest fares does not make an airline great as demonstrated by the fact that the lowcostnofrills approach earned spirit and frontier the two bottom spots in our study it will be interesting to see if the legacy carriers — united american and delta — will benefit from their ongoing focus on improving premium cabins while squeezing more and more out of their economy passengers with smaller seats and stripped down “basic economy” fares at the same time can southwest continue to thrive off its reputation as a small lowfare airline when it’s actually become the largest domestic carrier by passengers with airfares similar to the big  and successfully combining two different airline operations and cultures is extremely tricky — will alaska and virgin america avoid the pitfalls that have plagued airline mergers in the past who knows what the future will bring but our study shows just how the  biggest us airlines differ in terms of what they offer today and now with these tools and data you can pinpoint exactly which airline
