philosophy how we’re different contact us request info client login there are a hundred ways to manage money and a hundred ways to manage money successfully we practice a prudent approach by that we mean actively managing asset allocation with a pragmatic view to managing risk rather than a passive conventional buyandhold method for example on one end of the spectrum if the market moves from low risk to high risk we actively move to raise cash — in an attempt to minimize capital losses if the market moves on the other end of the spectrum — from “riskon” to highrisk exuberance — we actively move to take profits and change the allocation across all of our portfolio strategies we pursue a pointofview embracing three perspectives fundamental technical and macro these are at the heart of our actively managed mix of prudence and pragmatism that has historically given us solid performance while substantially limiting downside risk obviously this is in stark contrast to those funds or firms who actively seek the highest returns — while assuming the accompanying high levels of risk for our clients who wish to have a level of peace of mind without moving into fullblown conservatism
