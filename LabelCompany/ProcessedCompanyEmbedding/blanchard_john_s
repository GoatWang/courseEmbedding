evangelical press volumes  pages  back to top can we be good without god author john blanchard publisher evangelical press publication date  pages  sample pages              one of the things that distinguishes humankind from every other species on earth is that we have a moral dimension a moral law seems to be programmed into our psychological “software” and our awareness of it is triggered by the conscience a mysterious monitor that pokes its nose into every nook and cranny of our lives why should this be the case does our moral sense come from nature is it nothing more than a cultural phenomenon is personal preference the deciding factor have we any right to question another person’s moral choices are there consistent guidelines for deciding whether something is good or evil right or wrong just or unjust beyond these and other related questions lies an even greater one can we ever find a solid and coherent basis for morality unless our world view has god at the very centre of

species that led from the first living cell through invertebrates fish amphibians reptiles birds furry quadrupeds and apelike mammals what is the evidence for this fascinating scenario can we prove that life began in this way what are the odds against such a thing happening has archaeology found clear links between all species without limitation can we really show that all life forms owe their

worries failing health pain loneliness insecurity and depression they ask such things as “why am i here” “would it matter if i had never been born” “does life need to have any meaning” and “what happens to me when i die” yet these questions eventually funnel into others that are even deeper “is there anything beyond ‘one’ universe” “are we biological accidents living for a blink of time in a vast and vacant cosmos” “is there other and greater intelligence elsewhere” “is there a theory of everything or one reality that governs all the others” then comes the ultimate question “is anybody out there” this volume explores the issues—and points to the answers is god past his sellby date author john blanchard publisher evangelical press publication date  pages  sample pages

believe in atheists this is an entirely new book aimed toward those who consider themselves to be atheists and to challenge their view each chapter ends with a “witness” who from their own personal experience supports the claim made by the author in the chapter does god exist if so how can he sit by through pain suffering and injustice hasn’t science explained him away with brilliantly

evangelical press publication date  pages  sample pages              a simple way to introduce these studies in the minor prophets will be to ask and answer several questions about them who were they why are they known as “minor prophets” when and where did they live what was their ministry what was their message once we have answers to these questions we will be in a position to look at the prophets’ main themes before focusing on one specific statement made by each one of them not only should we rely wholeheartedly on the faithful exposition of the bible as the written word of god we should not insist on signs and wonders as an authentication of a preacher’s ministry the message is clear if people will not listen to the word of god and turn to him in repentance and faith as a result no “signs and wonders” will move them to do so not even a longburied friend coming back to life the bible is the only infallible word we have or need revealing to us that in the lord jesus christ we have the prophet to end all prophets the priest to end all priests and the king to end all kings our great need today is not for prophets but for preachers men who will give themselves

think seriously about hell and remain emotionally and psychologically unaffected the idea that after a few years of life on earth an untold number of human beings many of whom would be thought of as decent lawabiding citizens will spend eternity in indescribable agony and exposed to god’s relentless anger is overwhelming reaction to the paralyzing prospect of everlasting punishment varies from those who dismiss the whole idea because they reject the authority of scripture to those who seek to soften its impact by reducing hell to manageable proportions what does happen after death what if

which we can avoid hell or evade it these are vitally important questions and this book sets out to find answers to them where do we go from here author john blanchard publisher evangelical press

bible based thorough and honest —roger carswell evangelist leeds england where is god when things go wrong author john blanchard publisher evangelical press publication date  pages  sample pages              we live in what has been called “a world with ragged edges” earthquakes volcanoes floods hurricanes tsunamis fires famine and other natural disasters kill millions of people and injure countless others sometimes wiping out huge numbers within a few hours every day accidents claim an untold number of victims planes crash trains are derailed road vehicles collide ships are lost at sea buildings collapse bridges give way trees fall machinery malfunctions to make matters worse disease cuts relentless swathes through humankind causing immeasurable weakness pain and fear while “man’s inhumanity to man” brings a terrible toll of suffering yet the bible claims that god is in sole and sovereign control of everything that happens in the entire universe that he “works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will” and that he is “compassionate and gracious” and “abounding in love” is there any way in which all of this can hold together the answer may surprise you why believe the bible author john blanchard publisher evangelical press publication date  pages  sample pages              the bible is the most revered book in the world it is also the most reviled millions of people turn to it every day to find inspiration and direction for their lives yet for two thousand years no other book has been so hated vilified and attacked many of its translators have been persecuted tortured and murdered and countless copies of their work have been banned or destroyed yet for many people the bible is neither loved nor loathed it is nothing more than an ancient religious document that raises a host of questions how can we know that the present text is anything like the original is it anything more than folklore how can such an old book be relevant in the twentyfirst century has science not taken its place as an explanation of the world and our place in it here are the answers why on earth did jesus come author john blanchard publisher evangelical press publication date  pages  sample pages              year after year millions of people pitch into a growing whirlwind of activity in preparation for just one day december twentyfifth many of those who join in the excitement have at least some idea that this particular day is called christmas day because it celebrates the birth of jesus christ yet they have no idea why for millions of people around the world it has become the greatest highlight of the year it’s time to ask some questions who was this jesus do we actually know when he was born was there a special purpose in his birth is there anything special that makes him stand out over the other  billion people that have lived on earth how can a few years he spent here have any possible relevance for people living in the twentyfirst century why should we bother to find out in this lively volume blanchard strips away the myths and tells like it is here is the real story the dynamic truth that over the centuries has revolutionized countless lives read it carefully if you get the message no christmas day will ever be the same for you again—nor will any other day why the cross author john blanchard publisher evangelical press publication date  pages  sample pages              for centuries symbols have been used as a means of identification often in an immediate compact and powerful way for some two thousand years christianity has had a symbol that is universally recognized—a simple cross yet the cross represents not the character life or teaching of the founder of christianity but the gruesome way in which he was put to death while still in his early thirties for millions today a cross has become little more than a charm or good luck bracelet tattooed on their bodies or worn as jewelry the huge gap between the original event and the current symbol therefore raises some massive questions why has the symbol remained so universally popular was there anything unique about the crucifixion of jesus why was he put to death what difference can it make to me today here is a volume that answers all these questions—and many more—and makes it crystal clear that in the death of jesus lies our only hope of the forgiveness of sins and eternal life have you ever wondered why christians see so much significance in the death of jesus christ on a cross why did jesus have to die why such a humiliating public execution and what does his death mean for me john blanchard answers those questions and drawing on the eyewitness accounts recorded in the bible he explains the meaning of the cross in a clear simple powerful way —john f macarthur jr pastorteacher grace community church sun valley ca in these pages that mighty work which in all its greatness was accomplished on calvary’s

department of biochemistry dan danciger professor of biochemistry areas of research my laboratory is engaged in the structural and functional characterization of enzymes from mycobacterium tuberculosis we have discovered new drug combinations that are effective against strains of drug resistant tuberculosis professional interests john s blanchard research interests the treatment of bacterial infections with antibiotics is being severely compromised by the rapid development and dissemination of drug resistance and has become of significant clinical concern through a combination of recombinant dna methods protein purification kinetic and chemical mechanistic analysis and threedimensional structural description we are developing several enzymes into validated targets for subsequent inhibitor and potential drug design essential bacterial biosynthetic pathways bacteria must produce all twenty amino acids and all organic enzyme cofactors that were identified as vitamins many of these pathways are known to be essential for bacterial survival and the pantothenate pathway is one such pathway insertional inactivation of the pancd genes results in strains of m tuberculosis that are highly attenuated we have focused on the enzymological characterization of the early steps unique to bacteria and plants of coenzyme a biosynthesis an essential pathway in m tuberculosis starting with the condensation of two molecules of pyruvate pantothenate is generated by a series of enzymatic steps with few precedents in biology these include one of two examples of a bindependent methyl shift acetolactate isomeroreductase a reductive formyltransfer ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase and one of only a few examples of an atpdependent amide forming reaction pantothenate synthetase our enzymatic studies have been spurred by the recent determination of the threedimensional structures of most of the enzymes in this pathway antibiotic drug resistance studies from this laboratory were responsible for the identification of the target of the most widely used antitubercular drug isoniazid as being the m tuberculosis enoylacp reductase more recently our efforts have turned to the determination of the mechanisms of resistance to broadspectrum antibiotics in particular the aminoglycoside class of antibacterials clinical resistance to aminoglycosides is due to the expression of genes encoding enzymes that chemically modify the drug either by phosphorylation adenylylation or acetylation by far the most prevalent of these mechanism is nacetylation catalyzed by a wide range of enzymes that exhibit regioselective acetylation we are actively studying both the m tuberculosis ’acetyltransferase that can uniquely catalyze both ’o and nacetylation and the s enterica ’acetyltransferase regioselectivity of the reaction shown at right  the structures of these enzymes in complex with coa and ribostamycin has allowed us to define the molecular basis for the observed regioselectivity both of these enzymes are chromosomallyencoded suggesting that they have evolved their antibioticmodifying activity from an extant but unknown activity protein nacetyltransferases the aforementioned studies have led us to an examination of the gnat superfamily of nacetyltransferases of which both the prokaryotic aminoglycoside nacetyltransferases and eukaryotic histone acetyltransferases are members of the twentysix gnat superfamily members in e coli only one has been expressed and functionally characterized three are ribosomal protein nacetyltransferases and the other  have unknown function these small  aa enzymes can be identified from four sequence motifs that represent the core “fold” of the nacetyltransferases of which some  superfamily members can be identified in sequenced genomes the known monomer fold structures are nearly identical and represent an acetylcoa binding domain the specificity for the acetylatable substrate is determined both by residues of the monomer but also by residues at the dimer interface which are vastly different for different gnat’s the determination of the threedimensional structures of these enzymes and their ability to nacetylate both small molecules peptides and proteins suggests that these enzymes have have multiple substrates and physiological functions in order to determine the physiological substrates for the genomic ensemble of gnat’s we have developed a method and reagent which has allowed us to covalently modify the substrate of any acetyltransferase the reagent chloroacetylcoa claccoa is a substrate for the acetyltransferase and the chloroacetyl group is transferred to the substrate to generate the chloroacetylated product the other product coash is a potent nucleophile which attacks the achloroacetylated product to generate an acetylcoaylated substrate when ’pclaccoa is used the product of the reaction becomes radiolabeled and for protein substrates can be observed after sdspage and autoradiography we have shown that this reagent can be used to label ribosomal protein l in the presence of the rimlencoded nacetyltransferase we have also demonstrated that exogenously added thiolcontaining compounds containing both fluorecent probes and affinity labels can be used to identify both the known protein substrates of nacetyltransferases and other unknown substrates in cell extracts we wish to expand these studies to include the identification of all the substrates for all the nacetyltransferases in both salmonella enterica and mycobacterium tuberculosis we have also recently demonstrated that the yeast hat histone acetyltransferase will use claccoa as a substrate and will selectively chloroacetylate histones h and h in a mixture of yeast histones we now believe that the reagent will be useful in defining the expanding manifold of eukaryotic transcription factors whose acetylation status like those of the histones themselves regulates transcription and the activity and stability of the eukaryotic transcription apparatus  finally we are developing new methods to identify the large number of proteins that are known to be posttranslationally modified by lipidation including both myristoylation and palmitoylation suitability for undergraduate graduate and postdoctoral trainees the projects described above are eminently suitable for all levels of scientific trainees although the laboratory today has a preponderance of postdoctoral fellows and a single graduate student summer undergraduate students have participated in the research program and been coauthors in a number of published works undergraduate students with an interest in biological chemistry and a strong background in organic and physical chemistry

but what do you give to the thinking serious person who is wrestling with the christian faith and its relationship to the meaning of life john blanchard provides the answers in this new book written for christians to give to enquirers dr blanchard deals with the scientific and philosophical issues in his inimitable style leading at the heart of the book to a fullorbed presentation of the glories of the gospel professor sinclair ferguson says you can trust john blanchard in addition to the sheer clarity of what he writes he is honest and he is gracious at no point will you find yourself asking ‘what is he trying to say’ nothing here is dull merely ordinary or interesting he has that special gift if being insatiably curious about things and  this is his genius  he always seems to be asking if and how and why things happen why are you here will help you to connect the dots so that the big picturealthough composed of seemingly endless millions of facts really does begin to make sense dan walker presenter of bbc television’s football focus adds the journalist in me loves asking the ‘big’ questions mine are normally posed to famous faces who have just met with triumph or disaster or are preparing to i love getting the answers there are some questions in life that are really important though and they don’t come much more significant than ‘why are we here’ it’s a subject which gets to the heart of what makes us tick keeps us going governs out relationships and dictates what happens both during life and after death it sounds serious doesn’t it thankfully john blanchard has an incredible ability to strip away the guff cut through the rubbish and point towards the light this is a book that will make you think hard about what you consider to be true and if the author is right

novel druggable genetic vulnerability pathway in melanoma   abstract bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a clinically significant problem that threatens current paradigms of antibacterial chemotherapy this is particularly true for the treatment of tuberculosis where singly and multiplydrug resistant clinical strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis have been identified with increasing frequency very few compounds are selective antimycobacterial agents and mycobacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics either because of the constitutive expression of degrading enzymes eg betalactamases or the inability of antibiotics to penetrate the uniquely hydrophobic outer cell wall the principal investigator and his group have previously focused their attention on the dapllysine biosynthetic pathway and will use similar approaches to explore the threedimensional structures and chemical mechanisms of m tuberculosis enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pantothenate a vitamin in mammals and an essential pathway in m tuberculosis specifically they will clone express and purify the m tuberculosis ilvgm ilvc and ilvd gene products involved in branched chain and pantothenate biosynthesis and the panb gene product involved in pantothenate biosynthesis they will clone express and purify the m tuberculosis dxs and dxrencoded deoxyxylulosephosphate synthase and isomeroreductase for mechanistic comparison to the ilvc and ilvgmencoded enzymes they will also determine the structures and chemical mechanisms of aminoglycoside nacetyltransferases enzymes that are primarily responsible for clinical resistance to aminoglycosides in both gramnegative and grampositive bacterial pathogens these enzymes catalyze a rich variety of chemistries and plausible chemical mechanisms suggest that mechanismbased and bi and trisubstrate analogue inhibitors might be found they will continue to use an integrated approach involving kinetic and chemical mechanism studies threedimensional structural studies and sitedirected mutagenesis to identify active site residues important for substrate and inhibitor recognition and fulfill their long term goal
