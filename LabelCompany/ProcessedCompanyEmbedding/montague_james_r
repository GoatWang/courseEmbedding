james was an english author medievalist scholar and provost of kings college cambridge – and of eton college – though jamess work as a medievalist is still highly regarded he is best remembered for his ghost stories which are regarded as among the best in the genre james redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal gothic clichés of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings however jamess protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests accordingly he is known as the originator of the antiquarian ghost story

lifeedit james was born in a goodnestone dover clergy house in kent england although his parents had associations with aldeburgh in suffolk his father was herbert james an evangelical anglican clergyman and his mother mary emily née horton was the daughter of a naval officer he had two older brothers sydney and herbert nicknamed ber and an older sister grace sydney james later became archdeacon of dudley from the age of three  until  jamess home if not always his residence was at the rectory in great livermere suffolk this had previously been the childhood home of another eminent suffolk antiquary thomas martin of palgrave – several of jamess ghost stories are set in suffolk including oh whistle and ill come to you my lad felixstowe a warning to the curious aldeburgh rats and a vignette great livermere in september  he arrived as a boarder at temple grove school one of the leading boys preparatory schools of the day he lived for many years first as an undergraduate then as a don and provost at kings college cambridge where he was also a member of the pitt club the university provides settings for several of his tales apart from medieval subjects james studied the classics and appeared very successfully in a staging of aristophanes play the birds with music by hubert parry his ability as an actor was also apparent when he read his new ghost stories to friends at christmas timecitation needed scholarly worksedit james is best known for his ghost stories but his work as a medievalist scholar was prodigious and remains highly respected in scholarly circles indeed the success of his stories was founded on his antiquarian talents and knowledge his discovery of a manuscript fragment led to excavations in the ruins of the abbey at bury st edmunds west suffolk in  in which the graves of several twelfthcentury abbots described by jocelyn de brakelond a contemporary chronicler were rediscovered having been lost since the dissolution of the monasteries his  edition of the latin hagiography of æthelberht ii of east anglia king and martyr english historical review  remains authoritative he catalogued many of the manuscript libraries of the colleges of the university of cambridge among his other scholarly works he wrote the apocalypse in art which placed the english apocalypse manuscripts into families he also translated the new testament apocrypha and contributed to the encyclopaedia biblica  his ability to wear his learning lightly is apparent in his suffolk and norfolk dent  in which a great deal of knowledge is presented in a popular and accessible form and in abbeys great western railway  james also achieved a great deal during his directorship of the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge – he managed to secure a large number of important paintings and manuscripts including notable portraits by titian james was provost of eton college from  to  he was awarded the order of merit in  he died in  and was buried in eton town cemetery ghost storiesedit illustration by james mcbryde for m r jamess story oh whistle and ill come to you my lad james was close friends with the illustrator and the collection ghost stories of an antiquary in  was intended as a showcase for mcbrydes artwork but mcbryde died having completed only four plates jamess ghost stories were published in a series of collections ghost stories of an antiquary  more ghost stories of an antiquary  a thin ghost and others  and a warning to the curious and other ghost stories  the first hardback collected edition appeared in  many of the tales were written as christmas eve entertainments and read aloud to friends this idea was used by the bbc in  when they filmed christopher lee reading jamess stories in a candlelit room in kings college james perfected a method of storytelling which has since become known as jamesian the classic jamesian tale usually includes the following elements a characterful setting in an english village seaside town or country estate an ancient town in france denmark or sweden or a venerable abbey or university a nondescript and rather naive gentlemanscholar as protagonist often of a reserved nature the discovery of an old book or other antiquarian object that somehow unlocks calls down the wrath or at least attracts the unwelcome attention of a supernatural menace usually from beyond the grave according to james the story must put the reader into the position of saying to himself if im not very careful something of this kind may happen to me he also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion letting his reader fill in the blanks and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief he summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology ghosts and marvels two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are to me the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo  let us then be introduced to the actors in a placid way let us see them going about their ordinary business undisturbed by forebodings pleased with their surroundings and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head unobtrusively at first and then more insistently until it holds the stage he also noted another requisite in my opinion is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends but i have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story despite his suggestion in the essay stories i have tried to write that writers employ reticence in their work many of jamess tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence for example in lost hearts pubescent children are taken in by a sinister dabbler in the occult who cuts their hearts from their stillliving bodies in a  essay james stated reticence may be an elderly doctrine to preach yet from the artistic point of view i am sure it is a sound one reticence conduces to effect blatancy ruins it and there is much blatancy in a lot of recent stories they drag in sex too which is a fatal mistake sex is tiresome enough in the novels in a ghost story or as the backbone of a ghost story i have no patience with it at the same time dont let us be mild and drab malevolence and terror the glare of evil faces the stony grin of unearthly malice pursuing forms in darkness and longdrawn distant screams are all in place and so is a modicum of blood shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded the weltering and wallowing that i too often encounter merely recall the methods of m g lewis although not overtly sexual plots of this nature have been perceived as unintentional metaphors of the freudian variety jamess biographer michael cox wrote in m r james an informal portrait  one need not be a professional psychoanalyst to see the ghost stories as some release from feelings held in check reviewing this biography daily telegraph  the novelist and diarist anthony powell who attended eton under jamess tutelage commented that i myself have heard it suggested that jamess of course platonic love affairs were in fact fascinating to watch powell was referring to jamess relationships with his pupils not his peers other critics have seen complex psychological undercurrents in jamess work his authorial revulsion from tactile contact with other people has been noted by julia briggs in night visitors the rise and fall of the english ghost story  as nigel kneale said in the introduction to the folio society edition of ghost stories of m r james in an age where every man is his own psychologist m r james looks like rich and promising material  there must have been times when it was hard to be monty james or to put it another way although james conjures up strange beasts and supernatural manifestations the shock effect of his stories is usually strongest when he is dealing in physical mutilation and abnormality generally sketched in with the lightest of pens in addition to writing his own stories james championed the works of sheridan le fanu whom he viewed as absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories editing and supplying introductions to madame crowls ghost  and uncle silas  jamess statements about his actual beliefs about ghosts were ambiguous he wrote i answer that i am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me views on literature and politicsedit james held strongly traditional views about literature in addition to ghost stories he also enjoyed reading the work of william shakespeare and the detective stories of agatha christie by contrast james disliked most contemporary literature strongly criticizing the work of aldous huxley lytton strachey and james joyce whom james called a charlatan and that prostitutor of life and language james also supported the banning of radclyffe halls  novel about lesbianism the well of loneliness stating i believe miss halls book is about birth control or some kindred subject isnt it i find it difficult to believe either that it is a good novel or that its suppression causes any loss to literature as a student at kings james had opposed the appointment of thomas henry huxley as provost of eton because of huxleys agnosticism in his later life james had little interest in politics and rarely spoke on political issues however james often spoke out against the irish home rule movement and in his letters he also expressed a dislike for communism james friend a c benson considered him to be reactionary and against modernity and progress reception and influenceedit h p lovecraft was an admirer of jamess work extolling the stories as the peak of the ghost story form in his essay supernatural horror in literature  another renowned fan of james in the horror and fantasy genre was clark ashton smith who wrote an essay on him michael sadleir described m r james as the best ghoststory writer england has ever produced marjorie bowen also admired jamess work referring to his ghost stories as the supreme art of m r james mary butts another admirer of james wrote the first critical essay on his work the art of montagu james in the february  issue of the london mercury manly wade wellman esteemed james fiction in the great railway bazaar paul theroux refers to the mezzotint as the most frightening story i know in his list the  most terrifying horror stories t e d klein placed jamess casting the runes at number one e f bleiler has stated that james is in the opinion of many the foremost modern writer of supernatural fiction and he described more ghost stories of an antiquary as containing firstrate stories ruth rendell has also expressed admiration for jamess work stating there are some authors one wished one had never read in order to have the joy of reading them for the first time for me m r james is one of these david langford has described james as the author of the th centurys most influential canon of ghost stories sir john betjeman in an introduction to peter hainings book about james shows how influenced he was by jamess work in the year  i was a new boy at the dragon school oxford then called lynams of which the headmaster was c c lynam known as the skipper he dressed and looked like an old sea salt and in his gruff voice would tell us stories by firelight in the boys room of an evening with all the lights out and his back to the fire i remember he told the stories as having happened to himself  they were the best stories i ever heard and gave me an interest in old churches and country houses and scandinavia that not even the mighty hans christian andersen eclipsed betjeman later discovered the stories were all based on those of m r james h russell wakefields supernatural fiction was strongly influenced by the work of james a large number of british writers deliberately wrote ghost stories in the jamesian style these writers sometimes described as the james gang include a n l munby e g swain ingulphus pseudonym of sir arthur gray – amyas northcote and r h malden although some commentators consider their stories to be inferior to those of james himself although most of the early jamesian writers were male there were several notable female writers of such fiction including eleanor scott pseudonym of helen m leys – in the stories of her book randalls round  and d k broster in the collection couching at the door strange and macabre tales  l t c rolt also modelled his ghost stories on jamess work but unlike other jamesian writers set them in industrial locations such as mines and railways the stories of m r james continue to influence many of todays great supernatural writers including stephen king who discusses james in the  nonfiction book danse macabre and ramsey campbell who edited meddling with ghosts stories in the tradition of m r james and wrote the short story the guide in tribute the author john bellairs paid homage to james by incorporating plot elements borrowed from jamess ghost stories into several of his own juvenile mysteries several of jonathan aycliffes novels including whispers in the dark and the matrix are influenced by jamess work aycliffemaceoin studied for his phd in persian studies at kings college cambridge this makes three kings college authors of ghost stories james munby and aycliffe works inspired by jamesedit the composer kaikhosru shapurji sorabji wrote two pieces for piano with a link to james quaere

august  goodnestone kent england died  june  aged  eton buckinghamshire england pen name m r james occupation author scholar nationality british genre fantasy ghost stories montague rhodes james om fba  august  –  june  who published under the name m r james was an english author medievalist scholar and provost of kings college cambridge – and of eton college – though jamess work as a medievalist is still highly regarded he is best remembered for his ghost stories which are regarded as among the best in the genre james redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal gothic clichés of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings however jamess protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests accordingly he is known as the originator of the antiquarian ghost story contents  early life  scholarly works  ghost stories  views on literature and politics  reception and influence  works inspired by james

father was herbert james an evangelical anglican clergyman and his mother mary emily née horton was the daughter of a naval officer he had two older brothers sydney and herbert nicknamed ber and an older sister grace sydney james later became archdeacon of dudley from the age of three  until  jamess home if not always his residence was at the rectory in great livermere suffolk this had previously been the childhood home of another eminent suffolk antiquary thomas martin of palgrave – several of jamess ghost stories are set in suffolk including oh whistle and ill come to you my lad felixstowe a warning to the curious aldeburgh rats and a vignette great livermere in september  he arrived as a boarder at temple grove school one of the leading boys preparatory schools of the day he lived for many years first as an undergraduate then as a don and provost at kings college cambridge where he was also a member of the pitt club the university provides settings for several of his tales apart from medieval subjects james studied the classics and appeared very successfully in a staging of aristophanes play the birds with music by hubert parry his ability as an actor was also apparent when he read his new ghost stories to friends at christmas timecitation needed scholarly worksedit james is best known for his ghost stories but his work as a medievalist scholar was prodigious and remains highly respected in scholarly circles indeed the success of his stories was founded on his antiquarian talents and knowledge his discovery of a manuscript fragment led to excavations in the ruins of the abbey at bury st edmunds west suffolk in  in which the graves of several twelfthcentury abbots described by jocelyn de brakelond a contemporary chronicler were rediscovered having been lost since the dissolution of the monasteries his  edition of the latin hagiography of æthelberht ii of east anglia king and martyr english historical review  remains authoritative he catalogued many of the manuscript libraries of the colleges of the university of cambridge among his other scholarly works he wrote the apocalypse in art which placed the english apocalypse manuscripts into families he also translated the new testament apocrypha and contributed to the encyclopaedia biblica  his ability to wear his learning lightly is apparent in his suffolk and norfolk dent  in which a great deal of knowledge is presented in a popular and accessible form and in abbeys great western railway  james also achieved a great deal during his directorship of the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge – he managed to secure a large number of important paintings and manuscripts including notable portraits by titian james was provost of eton college from  to  he was awarded the order of merit in  he died in  and was buried in eton town cemetery ghost storiesedit illustration by james mcbryde for m r jamess story oh whistle and ill come to you my lad james was close friends with the illustrator and the collection ghost stories of an antiquary in  was intended as a showcase for mcbrydes artwork but mcbryde died having completed only four plates jamess ghost stories were published in a series of collections ghost stories of an antiquary  more ghost stories of an antiquary  a thin ghost and others  and a warning to the curious and other ghost stories  the first hardback collected edition appeared in  many of the tales were written as christmas eve entertainments and read aloud to friends this idea was used by the bbc in  when they filmed christopher lee reading jamess stories in a candlelit room in kings college james perfected a method of storytelling which has since become known as jamesian the classic jamesian tale usually includes the following elements a characterful setting in an english village seaside town or country estate an ancient town in france denmark or sweden or a venerable abbey or university a nondescript and rather naive gentlemanscholar as protagonist often of a reserved nature the discovery of an old book or other antiquarian object that somehow unlocks calls down the wrath or at least attracts the unwelcome attention of a supernatural menace usually from beyond the grave according to james the story must put the reader into the position of saying to himself if im not very careful something of this kind may happen to me he also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion letting his reader fill in the blanks and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief he summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology ghosts and marvels two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are to me the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo  let us then be introduced to the actors in a placid way let us see them going about their ordinary business undisturbed by forebodings pleased with their surroundings and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head unobtrusively at first and then more insistently until it holds the stage he also noted another requisite in my opinion is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends but i have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story despite his suggestion in the essay stories i have tried to write that writers employ reticence in their work many of jamess tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence for example in lost hearts pubescent children are taken in by a sinister dabbler in the occult who cuts their hearts from their stillliving bodies in a  essay james stated reticence may be an elderly doctrine to preach yet from the artistic point of view i am sure it is a sound one reticence conduces to effect blatancy ruins it and there is much blatancy in a lot of recent stories they drag in sex too which is a fatal mistake sex is tiresome enough in the novels in a ghost story or as the backbone of a ghost story i have no patience with it at the same time dont let us be mild and drab malevolence and terror the glare of evil faces the stony grin of unearthly malice pursuing forms in darkness and longdrawn distant screams are all in place and so is a modicum of blood shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded the weltering and wallowing that i too often encounter merely recall the methods of m g lewis although not overtly sexual plots of this nature have been perceived as unintentional metaphors of the freudian variety jamess biographer michael cox wrote in m r james an informal portrait  one need not be a professional psychoanalyst to see the ghost stories as some release from feelings held in check reviewing this biography daily telegraph  the novelist and diarist anthony powell who attended eton under jamess tutelage commented that i myself have heard it suggested that jamess of course platonic love affairs were in fact fascinating to watch powell was referring to jamess relationships with his pupils not his peers other critics have seen complex psychological undercurrents in jamess work his authorial revulsion from tactile contact with other people has been noted by julia briggs in night visitors the rise and fall of the english ghost story  as nigel kneale said in the introduction to the folio society edition of ghost stories of m r james in an age where every man is his own psychologist m r james looks like rich and promising material  there must have been times when it was hard to be monty james or to put it another way although james conjures up strange beasts and supernatural manifestations the shock effect of his stories is usually strongest when he is dealing in physical mutilation and abnormality generally sketched in with the lightest of pens in addition to writing his own stories james championed the works of sheridan le fanu whom he viewed as absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories editing and supplying introductions to madame crowls ghost  and uncle silas  jamess statements about his actual beliefs about ghosts were ambiguous he wrote i answer that i am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me views on literature and politicsedit james held strongly traditional views about literature in addition to ghost stories he also enjoyed reading the work of william shakespeare and the detective stories of agatha christie by contrast james disliked most contemporary literature strongly criticizing the work of aldous huxley lytton strachey and james joyce whom james called a charlatan and that prostitutor of life and language james also supported the banning of radclyffe halls  novel about lesbianism the well of loneliness stating i believe miss halls book is about birth control or some kindred subject isnt it i find it difficult to believe either that it is a good novel or that its suppression causes any loss to literature as a student at kings james had opposed the appointment of thomas henry huxley as provost of eton because of huxleys agnosticism in his later life james had little interest in politics and rarely spoke on political issues however james often spoke out against the irish home rule movement and in his letters he also expressed a dislike for communism james friend a c benson considered him to be reactionary and against modernity and progress reception and influenceedit h p lovecraft was an admirer of jamess work extolling the stories as the peak of the ghost story form in his essay supernatural horror in literature  another renowned fan of james in the horror and fantasy genre was clark ashton smith who wrote an essay on him michael sadleir described m r james as the best ghoststory writer england has ever produced marjorie bowen also admired jamess work referring to his ghost stories as the supreme art of m r james mary butts another admirer of james wrote the first critical essay on his work the art of montagu james in the february  issue of the london mercury manly wade wellman esteemed james fiction in the great railway bazaar paul theroux refers to the mezzotint as the most frightening story i know in his list the  most terrifying horror stories t e d klein placed jamess casting the runes at number one e f bleiler has stated that james is in the opinion of many the foremost modern writer of supernatural fiction and he described more ghost stories of an antiquary as containing firstrate stories ruth rendell has also expressed admiration for jamess work stating there are some authors one wished one had never read in order to have the joy of reading them for the first time for me m r james is one of these david langford has described james as the author of the th centurys most influential canon of ghost stories sir john betjeman in an introduction to peter hainings book about james shows how influenced he was by jamess work in the year  i was a new boy at the dragon school oxford then called lynams of which the headmaster was c c lynam known as the skipper he dressed and looked like an old sea salt and in his gruff voice would tell us stories by firelight in the boys room of an evening with all the lights out and his back to the fire i remember he told the stories as having happened to himself  they were the best stories i ever heard and gave me an interest in old churches and country houses and scandinavia that not even the mighty hans christian andersen eclipsed betjeman later discovered the stories were all based on those of m r james h russell wakefields supernatural fiction was strongly influenced by the work of james a large number of british writers deliberately wrote ghost stories in the jamesian style these writers sometimes described as the james gang include a n l munby e g swain ingulphus pseudonym of sir arthur gray – amyas northcote and r h malden although some commentators consider their stories to be inferior to those of james himself although most of the early jamesian writers were male there were several notable female writers of such fiction including eleanor scott pseudonym of helen m leys – in the stories of her book randalls round  and d k broster in the collection couching at the door strange and macabre tales  l t c rolt also modelled his ghost stories on jamess work but unlike other jamesian writers set them in industrial locations such as mines and railways the stories of m r james continue to influence many of todays great supernatural writers including stephen king who discusses james in the  nonfiction book danse macabre and ramsey campbell who edited meddling with ghosts stories in the tradition of m r james and wrote the short story the guide in tribute the author john bellairs paid homage to james by incorporating plot elements borrowed from jamess ghost stories into several of his own juvenile mysteries several of jonathan aycliffes novels including whispers in the dark and the matrix are influenced by jamess work

kings college cambridge – and of eton college – though jamess work as a medievalist is still highly regarded he is best remembered for his ghost stories which are regarded as among the best in the genre james redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal gothic clichés of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings however jamess protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests accordingly he is known as the originator of the antiquarian ghost story contents  early life  scholarly works  ghost stories  views on

england although his parents had associations with aldeburgh in suffolk his father was herbert james an evangelical anglican clergyman and his mother mary emily née horton was the daughter of a naval officer he had two older brothers sydney and herbert nicknamed ber and an older sister grace sydney james later became archdeacon of dudley from the age of three  until  jamess home if not always his residence was at the rectory in great livermere suffolk this had previously been the childhood home of another eminent suffolk antiquary thomas martin of palgrave – several of jamess ghost stories are set in suffolk including oh whistle and ill come to you my lad felixstowe a warning to the curious aldeburgh rats and a vignette great livermere in september  he arrived as a boarder at temple grove school one of the leading boys preparatory schools of the day he lived for many years first as an undergraduate then as a don and provost at kings college cambridge where he was also a member of the pitt club the university provides settings for several of his tales apart from medieval subjects james studied the classics and appeared very successfully in a staging of aristophanes play the birds with music by hubert parry his ability as an actor was also apparent when he read his new ghost stories to friends at christmas timecitation needed scholarly worksedit james is best known for his ghost stories but his work as a medievalist scholar was prodigious and remains highly respected in scholarly circles indeed the success of his stories was founded on his antiquarian talents and knowledge his discovery of a manuscript fragment led to excavations in the ruins of the abbey at bury st edmunds west suffolk in  in which the graves of several twelfthcentury abbots described by jocelyn de brakelond a contemporary chronicler were rediscovered having been lost since the dissolution of the monasteries his  edition of the latin hagiography of æthelberht ii of east anglia king and martyr english historical review  remains authoritative he catalogued many of the manuscript libraries of the colleges of the university of cambridge among his other scholarly works he wrote the apocalypse in art which placed the english apocalypse manuscripts into families he also translated the new testament apocrypha and contributed to the encyclopaedia biblica  his ability to wear his learning lightly is apparent in his suffolk and norfolk dent  in which a great deal of knowledge is presented in a popular and accessible form and in abbeys great western railway  james also achieved a great deal during his directorship of the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge – he managed to secure a large number of important paintings and manuscripts including notable portraits by titian james was provost of eton college from  to  he was awarded the order of merit in  he died in  and was buried in eton town cemetery ghost storiesedit illustration by james mcbryde for m r jamess story oh whistle and ill come to you my lad james was close friends with the illustrator and the collection ghost stories of an antiquary in  was intended as a showcase for mcbrydes artwork but mcbryde died having completed only four plates jamess ghost stories were published in a series of collections ghost stories of an antiquary  more ghost stories of an antiquary  a thin ghost and others  and a warning to the curious and other ghost stories  the first hardback collected edition appeared in  many of the tales were written as christmas eve entertainments and read aloud to friends this idea was used by the bbc in  when they filmed christopher lee reading jamess stories in a candlelit room in kings college james perfected a method of storytelling which has since become known as jamesian the classic jamesian tale usually includes the following elements a characterful setting in an english village seaside town or country estate an ancient town in france denmark or sweden or a venerable abbey or university a nondescript and rather naive gentlemanscholar as protagonist often of a reserved nature the discovery of an old book or other antiquarian object that somehow unlocks calls down the wrath or at least attracts the unwelcome attention of a supernatural menace usually from beyond the grave according to james the story must put the reader into the position of saying to himself if im not very careful something of this kind may happen to me he also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion letting his reader fill in the blanks and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief he summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology ghosts and marvels two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are to me the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo  let us then be introduced to the actors in a placid way let us see them going about their ordinary business undisturbed by forebodings pleased with their surroundings and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head unobtrusively at first and then more insistently until it holds the stage he also noted another requisite in my opinion is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends but i have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story despite his suggestion in the essay stories i have tried to write that writers employ reticence in their work many of jamess tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence for example in lost hearts pubescent children are taken in by a sinister dabbler in the occult who cuts their hearts from their stillliving bodies in a  essay james stated reticence may be an elderly doctrine to preach yet from the artistic point of view i am sure it is a sound one reticence conduces to effect blatancy ruins it and there is much blatancy in a lot of recent stories they drag in sex too which is a fatal mistake sex is tiresome enough in the novels in a ghost story or as the backbone of a ghost story i have no patience with it at the same time dont let us be mild and drab malevolence and terror the glare of evil faces the stony grin of unearthly malice pursuing forms in darkness and longdrawn distant screams are all in place and so is a modicum of blood shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded the weltering and wallowing that i too often encounter merely recall the methods of m g lewis although not overtly sexual plots of this nature have been perceived as unintentional metaphors of the freudian variety jamess biographer michael cox wrote in m r james an informal portrait  one need not be a professional psychoanalyst to see the ghost stories as some release from feelings held in check reviewing this biography daily telegraph  the novelist and diarist anthony powell who attended eton under jamess tutelage commented that i myself have heard it suggested that jamess of course platonic love affairs were in fact fascinating to watch powell was referring to jamess relationships with his pupils not his peers other critics have seen complex psychological undercurrents in jamess work his authorial revulsion from tactile contact with other people has been noted by julia briggs in night visitors the rise and fall of the english ghost story  as nigel kneale said in the introduction to the folio society edition of ghost stories of m r james in an age where every man is his own psychologist m r james looks like rich and promising material  there must have been times when it was hard to be monty james or to put it another way although james conjures up strange beasts and supernatural manifestations the shock effect of his stories is usually strongest when he is dealing in physical mutilation and abnormality generally sketched in with the lightest of pens in addition to writing his own stories james championed the works of sheridan le fanu whom he viewed as absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories editing and supplying introductions to madame crowls ghost  and uncle silas  jamess statements about his actual beliefs about ghosts were ambiguous he wrote i answer that i am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me views on literature and politicsedit james held strongly traditional views about literature in addition to ghost stories he also enjoyed reading the work of william shakespeare and the detective stories of agatha christie by contrast james disliked most contemporary literature strongly criticizing the work of aldous huxley lytton strachey and james joyce whom james called a charlatan and that prostitutor of life and language james also supported the banning of radclyffe halls  novel about lesbianism the well of loneliness stating i believe miss halls book is about birth control or some kindred subject isnt it i find it difficult to believe either that it is a good novel or that its suppression causes any loss to literature as a student at kings james had opposed the appointment of thomas henry huxley as provost of eton because of huxleys agnosticism in his later life james had little interest in politics and rarely spoke on political issues however james often spoke out against the irish home rule movement and in his letters he also expressed a dislike for communism james friend a c benson considered him to be reactionary and against modernity and progress reception and influenceedit h p lovecraft was an admirer of jamess work extolling the stories as the peak of the ghost story form in his essay supernatural horror in literature  another renowned fan of james in the horror and fantasy genre was clark ashton smith who wrote an essay on him michael sadleir described m r james as the best ghoststory writer england has ever produced marjorie bowen also admired jamess work referring to his ghost stories as the supreme art of m r james mary butts another admirer of james wrote the first critical essay on his work the art of montagu james in the february  issue of the london mercury manly wade wellman esteemed james fiction in the great railway bazaar paul theroux refers to the mezzotint as the most frightening story i know in his list the  most terrifying horror stories t e d klein placed jamess casting the runes at number one e f bleiler has stated that james is in the opinion of many the foremost modern writer of supernatural fiction and he described more ghost stories of an antiquary as containing firstrate stories ruth rendell has also expressed admiration for jamess work stating there are some authors one wished one had never read in order to have the joy of reading them for the first time for me m r james is one of these david langford has described james as the author of the th centurys most influential canon of ghost stories sir john betjeman in an introduction to peter hainings book about james shows how influenced he was by jamess work in the year  i was a new boy at the dragon school oxford then called lynams of which the headmaster was c c lynam known as the skipper he dressed and looked like an old sea salt and in his gruff voice would tell us stories by firelight in the boys room of an evening with all the lights out and his back to the fire i remember he told the stories as having happened to himself  they were the best stories i ever heard and gave me an interest in old churches and country houses and scandinavia that not even the mighty hans christian andersen eclipsed betjeman later discovered the stories were all based on those of m r james h russell wakefields supernatural fiction was strongly influenced by the work of james a large number of british writers deliberately wrote ghost stories in the jamesian style these writers sometimes described as the james gang include a n l munby e g swain ingulphus pseudonym of sir arthur gray – amyas northcote and r h malden although some commentators consider their stories to be inferior to those of james himself although most of the early jamesian writers were male there were several notable female writers of such fiction including eleanor scott pseudonym of helen m leys – in the stories of her book randalls round  and d k broster in the collection couching at the door strange and macabre tales  l t c rolt also modelled his ghost stories on jamess work but unlike other jamesian writers set them in industrial locations such as mines and railways the stories of m r james continue to influence many of todays great supernatural writers including stephen king who discusses james in the  nonfiction book danse macabre and ramsey campbell who edited meddling with ghosts stories in the tradition of m r james and wrote the short story the guide in tribute the author john bellairs paid homage to james by incorporating plot elements borrowed from jamess ghost stories into several of his own juvenile mysteries several of jonathan aycliffes novels including whispers in the dark and the matrix are influenced by jamess work

scholar nationality british genre fantasy ghost stories montague rhodes james om fba  august  –  june  who published under the name m r james was an english author medievalist scholar and provost of kings college cambridge – and of eton college – though jamess work as a medievalist is still highly regarded he is best remembered for his ghost stories which are regarded as among the best in the genre james redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal gothic clichés of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings however jamess protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests accordingly he is known as the originator of the antiquarian ghost story contents  early life  scholarly works  ghost stories  views on

magazine publication of uncollected tales  reprint collections  guidebooks  childrens books  notes  references  external links early lifeedit james was born in a goodnestone dover clergy house in kent england although his parents had associations with aldeburgh in suffolk his father was herbert james an evangelical anglican clergyman and his mother mary emily née horton was the daughter of a naval officer he had two older brothers sydney and herbert nicknamed ber and an older sister grace sydney james later became archdeacon of dudley from the age of three  until  jamess home if not always his residence was at the rectory in great livermere suffolk this had previously been the childhood home of another eminent suffolk antiquary thomas martin of palgrave – several of jamess ghost stories are set in suffolk including oh whistle and ill come to you my lad felixstowe a warning to the curious aldeburgh rats and a vignette great livermere in september  he arrived as a boarder at temple grove school one of the leading boys preparatory schools of the day he lived for many years first as an undergraduate then as a don and provost at kings college cambridge where he was also a member of the pitt club the university provides settings for several of his tales apart from medieval subjects james studied the classics and appeared very successfully in a staging of aristophanes play the birds with music by hubert parry his ability as an actor was also apparent when he read his new ghost stories to friends at christmas timecitation needed scholarly worksedit james is best known for his ghost stories but his work as a medievalist scholar was prodigious and remains highly respected in scholarly circles indeed the success of his stories was founded on his antiquarian talents and knowledge his discovery of a manuscript fragment led to excavations in the ruins of the abbey at bury st edmunds west suffolk in  in which the graves of several twelfthcentury abbots described by jocelyn de brakelond a contemporary chronicler were rediscovered having been lost since the dissolution of the monasteries his  edition of the latin hagiography of æthelberht ii of east anglia king and martyr english historical review  remains authoritative he catalogued many of the manuscript libraries of the colleges of the university of cambridge among his other scholarly works he wrote the apocalypse in art which placed the english apocalypse manuscripts into families he also translated the new testament apocrypha and contributed to the encyclopaedia biblica  his ability to wear his learning lightly is apparent in his suffolk and norfolk dent  in which a great deal of knowledge is presented in a popular and accessible form and in abbeys great western railway  james also achieved a great deal during his directorship of the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge – he managed to secure a large number of important paintings and manuscripts including notable portraits by titian james was provost of eton college from  to  he was awarded the order of merit in  he died in  and was buried in eton town cemetery ghost storiesedit illustration by james mcbryde for m r jamess story oh whistle and ill come to you my lad james was close friends with the illustrator and the collection ghost stories of an antiquary in  was intended as a showcase for mcbrydes artwork but mcbryde died having completed only four plates jamess ghost stories were published in a series of collections ghost stories of an antiquary  more ghost stories of an antiquary  a thin ghost and others  and a warning to the curious and other ghost stories  the first hardback collected edition appeared in  many of the tales were written as christmas eve entertainments and read aloud to friends this idea was used by the bbc in  when they filmed christopher lee reading jamess stories in a candlelit room in kings college james perfected a method of storytelling which has since become known as jamesian the classic jamesian tale usually includes the following elements a characterful setting in an english village seaside town or country estate an ancient town in france denmark or sweden or a venerable abbey or university a nondescript and rather naive gentlemanscholar as protagonist often of a reserved nature the discovery of an old book or other antiquarian object that somehow unlocks calls down the wrath or at least attracts the unwelcome attention of a supernatural menace usually from beyond the grave according to james the story must put the reader into the position of saying to himself if im not very careful something of this kind may happen to me he also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion letting his reader fill in the blanks and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief he summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology ghosts and marvels two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are to me the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo  let us then be introduced to the actors in a placid way let us see them going about their ordinary business undisturbed by forebodings pleased with their surroundings and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head unobtrusively at first and then more insistently until it holds the stage he also noted another requisite in my opinion is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends but i have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story despite his suggestion in the essay stories i have tried to write that writers employ reticence in their work many of jamess tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence for example in lost hearts pubescent children are taken in by a sinister dabbler in the occult who cuts their hearts from their stillliving bodies in a  essay james stated reticence may be an elderly doctrine to preach yet from the artistic point of view i am sure it is a sound one reticence conduces to effect blatancy ruins it and there is much blatancy in a lot of recent stories they drag in sex too which is a fatal mistake sex is tiresome enough in the novels in a ghost story or as the backbone of a ghost story i have no patience with it at the same time dont let us be mild and drab malevolence and terror the glare of evil faces the stony grin of unearthly malice pursuing forms in darkness and longdrawn distant screams are all in place and so is a modicum of blood shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded the weltering and wallowing that i too often encounter merely recall the methods of m g lewis although not overtly sexual plots of this nature have been perceived as unintentional metaphors of the freudian variety jamess biographer michael cox wrote in m r james an informal portrait  one need not be a professional psychoanalyst to see the ghost stories as some release from feelings held in check reviewing this biography daily telegraph  the novelist and diarist anthony powell who attended eton under jamess tutelage commented that i myself have heard it suggested that jamess of course platonic love affairs were in fact fascinating to watch powell was referring to jamess relationships with his pupils not his peers other critics have seen complex psychological undercurrents in jamess work his authorial revulsion from tactile contact with other people has been noted by julia briggs in night visitors the rise and fall of the english ghost story  as nigel kneale said in the introduction to the folio society edition of ghost stories of m r james in an age where every man is his own psychologist m r james looks like rich and promising material  there must have been times when it was hard to be monty james or to put it another way although james conjures up strange beasts and supernatural manifestations the shock effect of his stories is usually strongest when he is dealing in physical mutilation and abnormality generally sketched in with the lightest of pens in addition to writing his own stories james championed the works of sheridan le fanu whom he viewed as absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories editing and supplying introductions to madame crowls ghost  and uncle silas  jamess statements about his actual beliefs about ghosts were ambiguous he wrote i answer that i am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me views on literature and politicsedit james held strongly traditional views about literature in addition to ghost stories he also enjoyed reading the work of william shakespeare and the detective stories of agatha christie by contrast james disliked most contemporary literature strongly criticizing the work of aldous huxley lytton strachey and james joyce whom james called a charlatan and that prostitutor of life and language james also supported the banning of radclyffe halls  novel about lesbianism the well of loneliness stating i believe miss halls book is about birth control or some kindred subject isnt it i find it difficult to believe either that it is a good novel or that its suppression causes any loss to literature as a student at kings james had opposed the appointment of thomas henry huxley as provost of eton because of huxleys agnosticism in his later life james had little interest in politics and rarely spoke on political issues however james often spoke out against the irish home rule movement and in his letters he also expressed a dislike for communism james friend a c benson considered him to be reactionary and against modernity and progress reception and influenceedit h p lovecraft was an admirer of jamess work extolling the stories as the peak of the ghost story form in his essay supernatural horror in literature  another renowned fan of james in the horror and fantasy genre was clark ashton smith who wrote an essay on him michael sadleir described m r james as the best ghoststory writer england has ever produced marjorie bowen also admired jamess work referring to his ghost stories as the supreme art of m r james mary butts another admirer of james wrote the first critical essay on his work the art of montagu james in the february  issue of the london mercury manly wade wellman esteemed james fiction in the great railway bazaar paul theroux refers to the mezzotint as the most frightening story i know in his list the  most terrifying horror stories t e d klein placed jamess casting the runes at number one e f bleiler has stated that james is in the opinion of many the foremost modern writer of supernatural fiction and he described more ghost stories of an antiquary as containing firstrate stories ruth rendell has also expressed admiration for jamess work stating there are some authors one wished one had never read in order to have the joy of reading them for the first time for me m r james is one of these david langford has described james as the author of the th centurys most influential canon of ghost stories sir john betjeman in an introduction to peter hainings book about james shows how influenced he was by jamess work in the year  i was a new boy at the dragon school oxford then called lynams of which the headmaster was c c lynam known as the skipper he dressed and looked like an old sea salt and in his gruff voice would tell us stories by firelight in the boys room of an evening with all the lights out and his back to the fire i remember he told the stories as having happened to himself  they were the best stories i ever heard and gave me an interest in old churches and country houses and scandinavia that not even the mighty hans christian andersen eclipsed betjeman later discovered the stories were all based on those of m r james h russell wakefields supernatural fiction was strongly influenced by the work of james a large number of british writers deliberately wrote ghost stories in the jamesian style these writers sometimes described as the james gang include a n l munby e g swain ingulphus pseudonym of sir arthur gray – amyas northcote and r h malden although some commentators consider their stories to be inferior to those of james himself although most of the early jamesian writers were male there were several notable female writers of such fiction including eleanor scott pseudonym of helen m leys – in the stories of her book randalls round  and d k broster in the collection couching at the door strange and macabre tales  l t c rolt also modelled his ghost stories on jamess work but unlike other jamesian writers set them in industrial locations such as mines and railways the stories of m r james continue to influence many of todays great supernatural writers including stephen king who discusses james in the  nonfiction book danse macabre and ramsey campbell who edited meddling with ghosts stories in the tradition of m r james and wrote the short story the guide in tribute the author john bellairs paid homage to james by incorporating plot elements borrowed from jamess ghost stories into several of his own juvenile mysteries several of jonathan aycliffes novels including whispers in the dark and the matrix are influenced by jamess work

scholar nationality british genre fantasy ghost stories montague rhodes james om fba  august  –  june  who published under the name m r james was an english author medievalist scholar and provost of kings college cambridge – and of eton college – though jamess work as a medievalist is still highly regarded he is best remembered for his ghost stories which are regarded as among the best in the genre james redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal gothic clichés of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings however jamess protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests accordingly he is known as the originator of the antiquarian ghost story contents  early life  scholarly works  ghost stories  views on

england although his parents had associations with aldeburgh in suffolk his father was herbert james an evangelical anglican clergyman and his mother mary emily née horton was the daughter of a naval officer he had two older brothers sydney and herbert nicknamed ber and an older sister grace sydney james later became archdeacon of dudley from the age of three  until  jamess home if not always his residence was at the rectory in great livermere suffolk this had previously been the childhood home of another eminent suffolk antiquary thomas martin of palgrave – several of jamess ghost stories are set in suffolk including oh whistle and ill come to you my lad felixstowe a warning to the curious aldeburgh rats and a vignette great livermere in september  he arrived as a boarder at temple grove school one of the leading boys preparatory schools of the day he lived for many years first as an undergraduate then as a don and provost at kings college cambridge where he was also a member of the pitt club the university provides settings for several of his tales apart from medieval subjects james studied the classics and appeared very successfully in a staging of aristophanes play the birds with music by hubert parry his ability as an actor was also apparent when he read his new ghost stories to friends at christmas timecitation needed scholarly worksedit james is best known for his ghost stories but his work as a medievalist scholar was prodigious and remains highly respected in scholarly circles indeed the success of his stories was founded on his antiquarian talents and knowledge his discovery of a manuscript fragment led to excavations in the ruins of the abbey at bury st edmunds west suffolk in  in which the graves of several twelfthcentury abbots described by jocelyn de brakelond a contemporary chronicler were rediscovered having been lost since the dissolution of the monasteries his  edition of the latin hagiography of æthelberht ii of east anglia king and martyr english historical review  remains authoritative he catalogued many of the manuscript libraries of the colleges of the university of cambridge among his other scholarly works he wrote the apocalypse in art which placed the english apocalypse manuscripts into families he also translated the new testament apocrypha and contributed to the encyclopaedia biblica  his ability to wear his learning lightly is apparent in his suffolk and norfolk dent  in which a great deal of knowledge is presented in a popular and accessible form and in abbeys great western railway  james also achieved a great deal during his directorship of the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge – he managed to secure a large number of important paintings and manuscripts including notable portraits by titian james was provost of eton college from  to  he was awarded the order of merit in  he died in  and was buried in eton town cemetery ghost storiesedit illustration by james mcbryde for m r jamess story oh whistle and ill come to you my lad james was close friends with the illustrator and the collection ghost stories of an antiquary in  was intended as a showcase for mcbrydes artwork but mcbryde died having completed only four plates jamess ghost stories were published in a series of collections ghost stories of an antiquary  more ghost stories of an antiquary  a thin ghost and others  and a warning to the curious and other ghost stories  the first hardback collected edition appeared in  many of the tales were written as christmas eve entertainments and read aloud to friends this idea was used by the bbc in  when they filmed christopher lee reading jamess stories in a candlelit room in kings college james perfected a method of storytelling which has since become known as jamesian the classic jamesian tale usually includes the following elements a characterful setting in an english village seaside town or country estate an ancient town in france denmark or sweden or a venerable abbey or university a nondescript and rather naive gentlemanscholar as protagonist often of a reserved nature the discovery of an old book or other antiquarian object that somehow unlocks calls down the wrath or at least attracts the unwelcome attention of a supernatural menace usually from beyond the grave according to james the story must put the reader into the position of saying to himself if im not very careful something of this kind may happen to me he also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion letting his reader fill in the blanks and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief he summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology ghosts and marvels two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are to me the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo  let us then be introduced to the actors in a placid way let us see them going about their ordinary business undisturbed by forebodings pleased with their surroundings and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head unobtrusively at first and then more insistently until it holds the stage he also noted another requisite in my opinion is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends but i have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story despite his suggestion in the essay stories i have tried to write that writers employ reticence in their work many of jamess tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence for example in lost hearts pubescent children are taken in by a sinister dabbler in the occult who cuts their hearts from their stillliving bodies in a  essay james stated reticence may be an elderly doctrine to preach yet from the artistic point of view i am sure it is a sound one reticence conduces to effect blatancy ruins it and there is much blatancy in a lot of recent stories they drag in sex too which is a fatal mistake sex is tiresome enough in the novels in a ghost story or as the backbone of a ghost story i have no patience with it at the same time dont let us be mild and drab malevolence and terror the glare of evil faces the stony grin of unearthly malice pursuing forms in darkness and longdrawn distant screams are all in place and so is a modicum of blood shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded the weltering and wallowing that i too often encounter merely recall the methods of m g lewis although not overtly sexual plots of this nature have been perceived as unintentional metaphors of the freudian variety jamess biographer michael cox wrote in m r james an informal portrait  one need not be a professional psychoanalyst to see the ghost stories as some release from feelings held in check reviewing this biography daily telegraph  the novelist and diarist anthony powell who attended eton under jamess tutelage commented that i myself have heard it suggested that jamess of course platonic love affairs were in fact fascinating to watch powell was referring to jamess relationships with his pupils not his peers other critics have seen complex psychological undercurrents in jamess work his authorial revulsion from tactile contact with other people has been noted by julia briggs in night visitors the rise and fall of the english ghost story  as nigel kneale said in the introduction to the folio society edition of ghost stories of m r james in an age where every man is his own psychologist m r james looks like rich and promising material  there must have been times when it was hard to be monty james or to put it another way although james conjures up strange beasts and supernatural manifestations the shock effect of his stories is usually strongest when he is dealing in physical mutilation and abnormality generally sketched in with the lightest of pens in addition to writing his own stories james championed the works of sheridan le fanu whom he viewed as absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories editing and supplying introductions to madame crowls ghost  and uncle silas  jamess statements about his actual beliefs about ghosts were ambiguous he wrote i answer that i am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me views on literature and politicsedit james held strongly traditional views about literature in addition to ghost stories he also enjoyed reading the work of william shakespeare and the detective stories of agatha christie by contrast james disliked most contemporary literature strongly criticizing the work of aldous huxley lytton strachey and james joyce whom james called a charlatan and that prostitutor of life and language james also supported the banning of radclyffe halls  novel about lesbianism the well of loneliness stating i believe miss halls book is about birth control or some kindred subject isnt it i find it difficult to believe either that it is a good novel or that its suppression causes any loss to literature as a student at kings james had opposed the appointment of thomas henry huxley as provost of eton because of huxleys agnosticism in his later life james had little interest in politics and rarely spoke on political issues however james often spoke out against the irish home rule movement and in his letters he also expressed a dislike for communism james friend a c benson considered him to be reactionary and against modernity and progress reception and influenceedit h p lovecraft was an admirer of jamess work extolling the stories as the peak of the ghost story form in his essay supernatural horror in literature  another renowned fan of james in the horror and fantasy genre was clark ashton smith who wrote an essay on him michael sadleir described m r james as the best ghoststory writer england has ever produced marjorie bowen also admired jamess work referring to his ghost stories as the supreme art of m r james mary butts another admirer of james wrote the first critical essay on his work the art of montagu james in the february  issue of the london mercury manly wade wellman esteemed james fiction in the great railway bazaar paul theroux refers to the mezzotint as the most frightening story i know in his list the  most terrifying horror stories t e d klein placed jamess casting the runes at number one e f bleiler has stated that james is in the opinion of many the foremost modern writer of supernatural fiction and he described more ghost stories of an antiquary as containing firstrate stories ruth rendell has also expressed admiration for jamess work stating there are some authors one wished one had never read in order to have the joy of reading them for the first time for me m r james is one of these david langford has described james as the author of the th centurys most influential canon of ghost stories sir john betjeman in an introduction to peter hainings book about james shows how influenced he was by jamess work in the year  i was a new boy at the dragon school oxford then called lynams of which the headmaster was c c lynam known as the skipper he dressed and looked like an old sea salt and in his gruff voice would tell us stories by firelight in the boys room of an evening with all the lights out and his back to the fire i remember he told the stories as having happened to himself  they were the best stories i ever heard and gave me an interest in old churches and country houses and scandinavia that not even the mighty hans christian andersen eclipsed betjeman later discovered the stories were all based on those of m r james h russell wakefields supernatural fiction was strongly influenced by the work of james a large number of british writers deliberately wrote ghost stories in the jamesian style these writers sometimes described as the james gang include a n l munby e g swain ingulphus pseudonym of sir arthur gray – amyas northcote and r h malden although some commentators consider their stories to be inferior to those of james himself although most of the early jamesian writers were male there were several notable female writers of such fiction including eleanor scott pseudonym of helen m leys – in the stories of her book randalls round  and d k broster in the collection couching at the door strange and macabre tales  l t c rolt also modelled his ghost stories on jamess work but unlike other jamesian writers set them in industrial locations such as mines and railways the stories of m r james continue to influence many of todays great supernatural writers including stephen king who discusses james in the  nonfiction book danse macabre and ramsey campbell who edited meddling with ghosts stories in the tradition of m r james and wrote the short story the guide in tribute the author john bellairs paid homage to james by incorporating plot elements borrowed from jamess ghost stories into several of his own juvenile mysteries several of jonathan aycliffes novels including whispers in the dark and the matrix are influenced by jamess work
