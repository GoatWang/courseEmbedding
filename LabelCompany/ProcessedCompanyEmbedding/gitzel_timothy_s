girard director investor relations please go ahead ms girard rachelle girard thank you matt and good morning everyone welcome to camecos first quarter conference call to discuss the financial results thank you for joining us with us today are  of camecos senior management team they are tim gitzel president and ceo bob steane senior vice president and chief operating officer grant isaac senior vice president and chief financial officer and ken seitz senior vice president marketing and business development tim will begin with comments on camecos results for the first quarter and on current industry conditions then well open it up for your questions todays conference call is open to all members of the investment committee including the media operator instructions please note that this conference call will include forwardlooking information which is based on a number of assumptions and actual results could differ materially please refer to our annual information form and mda for more information about the factors that could cause these different results and the assumptions we have made with that i will turn it over to tim timothy s gitzel well thank you rachelle and welcome to everyone who has joined us on the call today as we discuss camecos first quarter results im pleased to say that we had a good start to the year continuing our strong financial and operational results from the fourth quarter of  most importantly this was achieved safely and responsibly safety of course is always a top focus for us and is really key to our success as a company revenue gross profit and net earnings were all up significantly in q of  compared to q of last year primarily as a result of higher sales volumes and a higher realized uranium price were seeing this increase in realized price occur even as spot and longterm prices have declined some of our older contracts that were signed at lower uranium prices are coming to an end and newer contracts are coming on this has contributed to our strong financial results for the past few quarters since  of our business comes from our uranium segment however as we noted in the mda our deliveries are not evenly distributed throughout the year we expect deliveries to be the lowest in our second quarter production was also strong this quarter up  from this time last year our mcarthur river operation is largely to thank for this increase as it was up  from q of  while production at inkai and smith ranchhighland was down the challenge is that these  operations are the same as those that we outlined in our annual mda but we are making progress at inkai our current wellfields are maturing which leads to lower grades and therefore lower production however this is expected with insitu operations and were working hard to bring on additional wellfields in order to add new highergrade wellfields to our production mix at smith ranchhighland in wyoming our production has been affected by an increase in the timelines for regulatory approval of new wellfields however im pleased to report that we recently received approval for the new knorth wellfield and production rates were starting to increase near the end of the first quarter we also saw a steady progress at cigar lake which is now about  complete although the details are in our mda but ill just touch on a couple of developments in january we broke through with shaft  on the meter level its expected to reach its final depth of  meters by mid and theres been enough infrastructure development that were now at the point where we can start putting the jet boring system in place to begin underground testing the first components are now on site and as more arrive well be lowering them into the mine and assembling the unit so the progress at cigar lake has been excellent and we remain ontrack for first packaged pounds next year in addition to the strong production and the progress at cigar lake were continuing to advance our projects under evaluation millennium project in northern saskatchewan is an important part of this strategy the biggest news on that front is the agreement we announced in march to purchase arevas interest in the millennium project our ownership of the project is now expected to increase to between  and  depending on whether our japanese partner jcu exploration decides to exercise its right of first refusal we expect to finalize these details and the agreement itself by early june cameco as you all know has operatorship of this important project our fuel services facilities continue to operate well and revenue from that segment was up  million over q of  with power although our share of earnings for q of  was lower than q of last year our realized price was up and this continues to be a good source of cash flow for cameco so overall id say this was a good first quarter weve made a lot of progress and are in line with our outlook for the year and are on track with our goal to increase annual uranium production to  million pounds we believe its important to pursue this goal of increased production now so that were ready when the market begins to demand further supply our view is that the question isnt if the market will call for more supply the question is when and while i dont have all the answers i can provide some sense of what we see in the market we know quite well whats happening with most nuclear programs around the world majority of countries with nuclear programs remain committed to having nuclear in their energy mix because it is a safe clean reliable and affordable energy option and others are joining the club there are some exceptions like germany but we know that their phaseout will occur slowly over time big question mark is japan it has only one reactor running which is expected to shut down for regular maintenance this month a plan for the future has not yet been announced we believe that japans reactors will eventually be brought back online not just because the country needs power and reliance on other energy sources is costly but because we see the japanese companies continuing to invest in uranium mining and exploration for example we have the japanese as partners in our cigar lake and kintyre projects and theyve been very clear that they remain committed to those projects we see our japanese partner in the millennium project considering an increase to its equity position and more recently weve seen some japanese utilities out in the market looking for nuclear fuel all of the signs seem to point to japan eventually bringing reactors back online which could be a major catalyst to helping the industry move out of the nearterm uncertainty that we are currently in as ive said in the past the real story for nuclear isnt the near term its the longterm fundamentals of the industry which remain very strong our numbers show that  net new reactors are expected by   of those are under construction right now most significant are countries like south korea india russia and of course china where were seeing the most growth theres even growth in the united states where the government recently granted the first licenses in  years for the construction and operation of new plants  at the vogtle side in georgia and  at the vc summer site in south carolina this is very good news for our industry and for cameco more reactors mean more demand for uranium and with the end of the heu agreement nearing in  and some producers delaying and canceling projects that are no longer feasible we believe the industry could face supply challenges in the nottoodistant future thats why were confident that double u remains the right strategy for cameco were confident in the future of the industry and in our own ability to successfully grow the company and build value for our shareholders so with that wed be pleased to answer any questions thank you questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question is from orest wowkodaw from canaccord genuity orest wowkodaw  canaccord genuity research division tim in terms of meeting your goal at double u i think by  when do you think you need to make development decisions on millennium and kintyre to meet that goal timothy s gitzel so let me just back up just to touch and say that our double u of course involves several different projects including cigar lake which is on track and cigar lake is the foundation really thatll provide about half of what we are looking for youve seen the charts that weve put in our annual mda with the different projects that were pushing forward at different rates to accomplish the double u you mentioned inkai at inkai were progressing up the chain now were getting it to the  ton mark this year and looking to move up to  ton and once we get approval hopefully next year and going forward and then were still working with them on doubledouble which is increasing production even further so were advancing that as quickly as we can but it  we are making progress with them on the kintyre project were just finalizing the feasibility study right now  the prefeasibility study sorry right now its just getting the final touches put on it over the next i would say weeks and months we have a process inside cameco to take a close look at the prefeasibility results and then decide what our next move is and so well have some more information on that i would say at our second quarter but that ones moving along as well orest wowkodaw  canaccord genuity research division so would you hope to make a decision at kintyre sort of sometime next year as of postfeasibility i guess timothy s gitzel yes well its step by step it has to go stage gate by stage gate for us and so well look at the prefeas as i say over the next weeks and months and then the next step would be a feasibility study which would take some time you look at bob probably a year or so for the feasibility study and then wed be at another stage gate where wed decide whether to move the project to development orest wowkodaw  canaccord genuity research division and how about millenium when can we anticipate that study and sort of development decision timothy s gitzel yes so millennium will have the feasibility study this year some time weve submitted some draft environmental assessment documents in so were moving that along so again we are partners who are looking to close up the deal on millennium with areva and the japanese partners well end up seeing what the different equity interests are and then i would say toward the end of the year well be in a better position to take a decision on going forward with millennium orest wowkodaw  canaccord genuity research division okay and then just one further question on a different topic your comment suggests the japanese are very much committed to nuclear im just wondering if you could share any more color on the i guess the cancellation of the contract that you disclosed in your mda today as sort of how we should reconcile that in our mind timothy s gitzel well youll note that we didnt disclose where that contract was from so you can make your own judgment on that i would say as we said in our mda the japanese continue to participate in the mining projects tepco which is our partner in cigar lake continues to pay its share of the cost of construction jcu and others mitsubishi and so as i say we believe that over time theyre going to bring the fleet back online we know they have  units ready to go waiting a final approval from one of the prefectures so were looking forward to them restarting that program orest wowkodaw  canaccord genuity research division okay so just to be clear youre saying we should not necessarily assume thats a japanese contract timothy s gitzel im saying i just  im sorry i can tell you where that contract is from operator your next question is from greg barnes from td securities greg barnes  td securities equity research tim or ken i guess in the discussion around the uranium market you say you see limited longterm contracting occurring but in the trade press ux and tradetech over the past several weeks theyve been talking about increasing interest in the longterm contracting market im trying to reconcile the  views timothy s gitzel ken kenneth a seitz yes so greg the way we would put it is and weve been saying for time now that if we look to the long term demand has been somewhat discretionary and so the way that were heavily committed for about the next  years while utilities have been well covered but weve also said that in the nottoodistant future customers are going to have to come to start putting volumes under longterm contracts for that sort of period beyond  years and that we expected that to start happening fairly soon and so i would say that today we dont see a huge amount of contracting in the longterm but it is in fact just starting to happen and i think thats what makes our view consistent with uxs just over the quarter now weve had several requests for proposals come in to put volumes under longterm contracts so we had  demand had been discretionary its becoming less discretionary and were seeing some customers come forward for longterm contracting greg barnes  td securities equity research regionally where are those customers coming from ken kenneth a seitz in fact theres some us customers in there theres some european were even entertaining one request from a japanese utility and so fairly evenly distributed i would say greg barnes  td securities equity research what about china and india kenneth a seitz we know that the indians are in the market looking for more material right now cameco doesnt sell uranium to india but were working on  we have an office there and were certainly working on putting uranium under longerterm contracts there we were just  tim and i were just there and the goal is to go from  gigawatts to  gigawatts over the next  years so the indians will be in the market and then the chinese were seeing some activity there as well greg barnes  td securities equity research in the fair market though ken kenneth a seitz thats right operator our next question is from john hughes from desjardins securities john hughes  desjardins securities inc research division just  quick ones one the  million for the charge in q is that a before or aftertax number timothy s gitzel grant i believe thats a pretax number grant e isaac thats a pretext number yes john hughes  desjardins securities inc research division okay so can we just use a set sort of  tax rate on that for aftertax grant e isaac no this wouldnt fit into the larger conversation about our consolidated tax number of course we do have a cameco group of companies and we sell our product through cameco companies that are outside of canada so that wouldve be the right tax number and the consolidated affect really is minimal so you saw a recovery in this period and we expect similar in quarter  john hughes  desjardins securities inc research division okay that helps and then just looking at your sure share production forecast through to  to the  million pounds im wondering how variable that number may be in the year as the heu contract falls away and are we looking at plus or minus  to  in other words in the absence of that contract and that  million pounds could we see an additional  type of thing in terms of your production in that year timothy s gitzel we dont have a whole lot of variability in production because of the  some of the caps that are put on through the regulatory system so we  when we put these numbers out theyre what we believe is our very best estimate of what we can produce in any given year youve seen us at mcarthur key have some flexibility to catch up on some new balance that were produced in past years were running out of those i would say so i would say there littles flexibility on those numbers john hughes  desjardins securities inc research division and last one have you seen any over the quarter or so far in q any sort of kickback on any inventory coming out of reactors or otherwise out of japan timothy s gitzel i think weve been pretty clear stating that we went very quickly after march   to our customers and said that if we could be of assistance in managing their inventories wed be happy to do that and so we have last year and this year had some deferrals from some of our customers which we were happy to work with them on and so we have not seen any major unloading of inventories into the market by any of the utilities and as i say we stand ready to work with any of our customers in that regard operator operator instructions the next question is from anthony young from dahlman rose anthony young  dahlman rose  company llc research division in the last quarter you guys indicated that there were about  million pounds of inventory that have been built up between japan and germany do you guys have any further color on where that inventory may stand today timothy s gitzel not sure i know what youre referring to anthony on those  million pounds of inventory ken are you kenneth a seitz no i dont we havent put out estimates of inventory or excess inventory holdings as a result of the event in japan i would also say that those numbers are actually changing on a daily basis as well as the units in japan come off and then come back on i think we would just point back to tims earlier answer and that is we havent seen any of that material splashing around in the spot market evidenced by the stability in the spot market to price and so again just making prognostications about inventory levels we havent done that anthony young  dahlman rose  company llc research division okay and then with respect to the chart that you guys have on page  looking at it it looks very similar to the chart that was produced in the fourth quarter with the cancellation of that contract has that already been factored in to this chart or will there be some revisions in subsequent quarters timothy s gitzel yes i believe its been factored in ken do you have any further comments kenneth a seitz no thats right its been factored into the latest table operator the next question is from tyler langton from jpmorgan tyler j langton  jp morgan chase  co research division just with regard to the production in the first quarter was just a little bit lower than what you need on a  sort of on a run rate basis to meet your full year guidance was that just a timing issue or can you just give any more details around that timothy s gitzel you might be looking at our share of production i think we were on track mcarthur in fact slightly ahead of budget so not sure bob any comment on that robert a steane no im not sure where youre interpreting a lower production but mcarthur key had a very good very strong first quarter tyler j langton  jp morgan chase  co research division i apologize i could just be looking at the wrong number and then like further out with the us operations is there any way to quantify just sort of getting the permits and  if delays in that in the next couple of years or next year or so can you kind of quantify how much that could potentially sort of be at risk to production timothy s gitzel so were working on a  and as we said in the quarter and i think my comments earlier that we see some improvements i think the regulators there are swamped or busy and were seeing it take us a lot longer to get the approvals we need to bring on new wellfields at are existing operations and then some of our new projects north butte gas hills as well so were working very closely with the regulators theres certainly more than one and trying to facilitate their work so we were just talking this morning about our guidance on production in the us nebraska happens to be doing quite well and are indeed on production and even a little bit more smith ranch a little bit behind we think overall our guidance is strong for the us and were certainly working hard to bring those new wellfields and new production centers online operator your next question is from borden putnam from mione capital borden putnam tim if i could direct you back to the reserve statement for a second for you or bob at mcarthur river there were some pretty material upgrades you had about  million pounds that went from inferred to indicated and then also at probable you had another some million pounds that moved from probable to proven can you tell us how that was achieved was it additional drilling or by infrastructure reaching those areas and where exactly do those increases reside and then i have a followup timothy s gitzel okay ill ask bob steane to answer that robert a steane that was a combination of both there was some additional drilling that turns some of those indicated into inferred and increased the reserves and also some of the development and some of the success weve had in working in different mining methods in the mine that have opened up some additional material for reserves borden putnam is that in the zone  or on zone  panel  bob robert a steane a little bit of both more on the lower zone  borden putnam okay and a followup on inkai the past  years theres been sort of the reverse of fortune from what we just talked about at mcarthur there seems to be a material thats moving out of probable and a couple of million pounds here and there and  million pounds in this last year and moving down to indicated does this relate to the wellfield issues you were talking about in your quarterly results or is there something else going on because its not adding to  i mean i know you do produce from probable at inkai but anyway maybe you could explain a little bit more about that timothy s gitzel yes borden its tim i think that has more to do with the term of the leases that we have there and were  our experts here at alain mainville is currently  are constantly looking at our reserve and resource base there and allocating them based on  we have a term there of course one of the blocks term expires i believe in  and the other in  and so we have significant reserves and resources and we have to continually adjust those to the length of the leases we have so thats why youre seeing some movement in those categories operator the next question is from greg barnes from td securities greg barnes  td securities equity research again tim and ken looking forward to  when the heu agreement expires  well i guess the end of  and youre beginning to ramp up cigar theres going to be a bit of a gap between those  events happening do you think youll be able to maintain the million to millionpoundayear sales number will that mean more purchases in the spot market or the term market timothy s gitzel yes greg we do believe we will be able to maintain those numbers from several different sources and ill let ken speak to those different sources kenneth a seitz yes sure greg yes we do believe that we will continue to maintain guidance in that sort of  million to  million pounds through that period we may have a few things at our disposal of course cigar lake starting in  and ramping up is part of it in addition to that we have inventory at various facilities around the world that we utilize depending on where they sit and then our sales targets and so on we will continue to make purchases but id like to stress that well never put ourselves in a position where were forced to make a purchase we make purchases when they make sense for us but if we looked at all of that and just given our plans today i know we expect to maintain sales guidance in that kind of range greg barnes  td securities equity research but what do you think your purchase volumes will be over that   range kenneth a seitz probably  we cant disclose that at the moment i think theres some competitive information there so rather not touch on exactly what our purchases would be to that period we do plan to purchase some again never forced to go into the market operator operator instructions your next question is from oscar cabrera from bank of america merrill lynch oscar cabrera  bofa merrill lynch research division im going more or less in the same direction that greg was going but if i may ask the following for your kintyre and millennium projects i think in the previous conference call we talked about startups around  do you have a scoping study or an idea of how much production can come out of those  deposits timothy s gitzel well itll depend oscar on the results of the prefeasibility study in one case and the feasibility in the other and so yes we have some ideas of what could come out of those projects but i think its a little bit early to say what the production levels would be as i said the millennium feasibility study is just being finalized and well have that soon we know its about  million pounds there and so well look at the optimized mining and milling rate for that in the feasibility study and then millennium same thing were just waiting to get the prefeasibility kintyre the same thing were waiting to get the prefeasibility study for kintyre as i say over the next  weeks and months well look at the different mechanics of that and what would be the optimized production rate there so were  a little bit early for us to comment on that but well come forward with that information in the near term oscar cabrera  bofa merrill lynch research division but i mean do you believe or are you saying that you need these projects to come onstream before  or around  timothy s gitzel well we need them  theyre part of our rampup to  million pounds by  so i cant tell you exactly when they come on because we dont know because theres a lot of work to do environmental work the feasibility engineering and then the construction and commissioning on all of them so theyre part of the rampup thats why youve seen our colored chart we call it our heat chart here but our colored chart that show the different projects and when approximately we see them coming on but we havent been specific on that for good reasons because these projects are    to  years in the rampup and so we dont know the specifics exactly of when theyll start up but theyre in the period to  operator your next question is from brian macarthur from ubs securities brian macarthur  ubs investment bank research division i just want to follow up you made a comment about youve never put yourself at risk of buying  having to buy pounds when you go through that period where youre short of a little more material you talked about getting inventories when you make the statement that youre never forced to go and buy is that meaning you have inventory to back everything you think through that period or does it mean you have interruption insurance or whatever you phrase it so that if you have production problems youd just be covered off at the end of the day timothy s gitzel brian since ken made the comment ill let him answer it as well kenneth a seitz yes it means all of the above really brian and that is as you know we have our supply reduction language in all of our contracts that if we do have a production problem we wont necessarily be forced to go to the market and buy and so again were writing that in our contracts today in terms of inventories we hold about  months of forward sales in inventory which at any given time might be  million pounds of uranium and so again we work very hard to not put ourselves in a position where we would be forced to go to the market and i can say that when we say that we mean it we will  we wont parse ourselves into that situation     bridge and to gregs earlier question again cigar lake we also have the increment from  tons from inkai talvivaara starting production in that period to the tune of  million pounds a year and in fact some extra heu quantities at the end of  and so you look at all that and again just to give you some comfort that we expect sales to be in the range that they are today brian macarthur  ubs investment bank research division one other question its a little bit different just your wording on the uranium market you talk about us department of energy material being introduced to the market i mean i know theres theoretical leu and stoppage ph should i read anything into that has anything changed from before thats not any heu or pounds or anything new that youre seeing coming out of doe timothy s gitzel brian thats a good question thats a matter were following really closely because its a evolving topic down there with the current situation with usec and what the doe is going to do with that and i know kens right up to date on that too so ken maybe you can just give an update on that matter its a good question kenneth a seitz it is a good question and its quite timely in that  so the doe has excess material and we know that and we know that plan to put it in the market then in  they worked very hard with industry to drop a plan for that and so they wouldnt put any more than  of us requirements into the market in any given year which equates to about  million pounds a year so thats on the books and weve anticipated that for some time there are discussions taking place in washington today we know that around usec and the viability of usec and their plants and certain parts of the us where jobs are pretty important and so it looks as though something may be evolving between some us utilities the us department of energy and usec whereby department of energy would provide some higher assay tails to usec for reenrichment and those  the natural uranium that comes out of that would go into inventories in some large us utilities so in terms of impact on the spot market or in the market its actually  its a fairly  kind of a good news story and that we expect it will go into inventory but i would say brian to your question it is material that would be over and above  we think over and above that industry consensus again at  this could be  to  of us requirement so operator we have a followup question from greg barnes from td securities greg barnes  td securities equity research ken you said something about extra heu quantities at the end of  what did you mean by that kenneth a seitz yes under the heu agreement in  and its just given the way its evolved over the last  years with respect to first and second options were getting a little additional heu in  this year i think weve disclosed that its about  million pounds  million pounds next year itll be closer to about  million pounds and thats  that will be the year  the quantity for the year and the final quantity operator that will conclude the questions from the telephone lines i would now like to turn the meeting to tim gitzel for closing remarks timothy s gitzel well thank you operator and thank you to everyone who joined us on the call today in closing i would just add that even though were in a period of uncertainty now catalysts such as reactor restarts in japan china approving new builds again or our utilities returning to the market could quickly change that at cameco were working hard to deliver consistent reliable results like we saw this quarter and prepare for the growth

quarter then well open it up for your questions todays conference call is open to all members of the investment community including the media operator instructions please note that this conference call will include forwardlooking information which is based on a number of assumptions and actual results could differ materially please refer to our annual information form and mda for more information about the factors that could cause these different results and the assumptions we have made with that i will turn it over to tim timothy gitzel well thank you rachelle and welcome to everyone who has joined us on the call today to discuss camecos third quarter results we appreciate you taking the time to join us i will start today by briefly discussing the market and our results and then i will open it up for your questions our overall message remains the same the market is challenging and our focus is to stay competitive and prepare for the time when more uranium production is needed from a market perspective there was no fundamental change in the market this quarter utilities remain well covered supply continues to perform reasonably well and japanese restarts although progressing have yet to materialize we continue to believe that about twothirds of the japanese fleet will return to operation and there was good news on that front recently on tuesday it was reported that the host town for the two sendai reactors gave the goahead for restart so we could see those reactors starting up in the near future other japanese reactors continue to edge closer to restart as well but it’s clear that this continues to be a challenging process of course japan isn’t the only factor to influence the market other issues can affect price which we saw recently when the spot price increase ph rose about  we believe the move was largely due to trading activity and market speculation around unforeseen events like the potential of russian sanctions possible disruption in the us department of energy’s inventory dispositions and the labor disruption at our own mcarthur river and key lake operations we will have to wait and see if the increase is sustainable but it has remained relatively stable thus far within this context cameco continued to achieve steady results consolidated revenue for the quarter and the yeartodate was comparable for the same period last year however earnings were impacted by a writedown of our investment in global laser enrichment and the higher cost of sales in our uranium segment and some of our market related contracts were affected by the lower uranium price compared to last year which brought our average realized price for the quarter down slightly however more importantly our yeartodate realized price results are comparable to the first nine months of last year and continue to outperform the market by a significant margin turning to production our operations performed well and the volumes are down slightly in mcarthur river and key lake due to the labor disruption as you know in july we stopped jet boring in cigar lake to let certain sections of the ore body to freeze more thoroughly we resumed mining at cigar lake later in the quarter and with more ground now frozen and the available for mining we have mitigated a possible risk to productivity and compliant for more continuous rampup the timing of the pause was opportune as the mcclean lake mill was not yet ready to process the cigar lake order it is now on october  we were delighted to take part in the mcclean lake mill restart celebrations where we marked the occasion of the first drums of packaged uranium from cigar lake it was an important milestone and one we are all very happy to see there is still work to be done at both the mine and mill to increase annual production capacity to  million pounds by  and that rampup will continue over the next few years for  though we are revising our annual outlook for production as a result of the experience gained in commissioning at the cigar lake mine and the mcclean lake mill and the labor related shutdown at mcarthur riverkey lake previously we expected to produce between  million and  million pounds we now expect to product between  million and  million pounds and there are a number of changes to our outlook for the remainder of  in general they are as a result of weak market conditions that have continued to impact the entire nuclear industry in our nukem segment we’ve reduced our expected sales volume and revenue as today’s market does not provide a lot of motivation for more sales that reduction is the main driver behind the expected decrease in our consolidated revenue the good news is the outlook for sales volume and revenue in our uranium segment remains the same and this is the core of our business so i hope that gives you a little more detail on where we are at this quarter and we’d certainly be happy to answer any questions you might have and with that i will turn it back to donna questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from ben isaacson from scotiabank ben isaacson – scotiabank hi it’s ben isaacson here thank you for taking my questions two questions first can you explain why funding was significantly reduced to gle and my second question is on the cash cost of purchased products it’s been jumping around a little bit  to  now can you explain why that’s been happening and how should we think about it going forward timothy gitzel hi it’s tim you have – just on the first one the gle piece i think it’s a question of priorities for partner gehitachi they have been in this business for sometime we’re  in this joint venture and they have been funding along and we’ve had made progress but i think in their bigger world this wasn’t a priority at this time certainly the market is not brilliant either for uranium or for enrichment and they just decided to do a tonedown their funding and we obviously had to do the same so that’s the gle piece i’ll let grant isaac to talk about our cash cost grant isaac sure happy to do that ben with respect to cash cost i think you’re probably referring to a much higher unit cost number that you saw last quarter that was the result largely on the sales agreement that we had agreed to at a much earlier time period so we sourced the material and sold that when the uranium price was much higher of course reflected in those cash costs for this quarter we didn’t have any of those kinds of legacy opportunities on the purchase side but it will jump around especially as our purchasing has come down relative to stored volumes under the atu program ben isaacson – scotiabank so when i look over the past couple of years you have averaged about  is that so going forward grant isaac well we don’t have a forecast for that going forward it will eventually get buried into our average unit cost of sales which is always going to be the marker we put out there to provide guidance and probably we would leave at that ben isaacson – scotiabank okay that’s great i’ll jump back in the q timothy gitzel thanks ben operator thank you our next question is from gregg barnes from td securities please go ahead gregg barnes – td securities yeah ken and tim just comment around the market when you say supply is readily available and it sounds like it’s adjusting market to surplus can you give us a sense how you big the surplus is by your estimate in the moment and what it looks like going forward over the next couple of years timothy gitzel well gregg we think that the demand today and when we said it’s often in  million to  million upon range we think increasing  to  over the next  years to somewhere  range that’s good growth for us we like that that’s the  units that are under construction today and more to come  or  net new units in the next  years that’s on the demand side supply side a little bit less than that probably  to  we were just looking at the list this morning of some of the project deferrals now cancellations some of the production that has gone down maybe not as much as we would have expected but the list is becoming quite significant so we’ll see where things go not easy decisions we know to flex your production down i think the market is coming back in the near future you might hang in there i think it’s longer term you might not so it’s really a tricky period of time right now but we think the gap today is perhaps  million pounds or  million pounds and growing over time as the demand line grows i’m not sure you see the same with the supply side in fact it’s probably tripling off the other way so that’s what we’re looking at going forward how much inventory is out there that’s the magic number but everyone has their own views on i’m not sure we have the exact number there either but i think it’s diminishing over time gregg barnes – td securities tim do you look at flexing your production in response to that curve market and what you think are going to happen over the next couple of years anyway timothy gitzel yeah gregg we look at all of our operations all of the time and as you know we’ve got some producers that are in the lower core zone ph some that aren’t so that’s a consideration we take you’ve got the entire management team sitting around this table we talk about that all the time right now we have sales guidance committed sales  million to  million pounds production something less than that and so we need the production but i could tell you we look very seriously at our production all of the time and when we say we want to be able to flex our production it’s both ways gregg barnes – td securities okay thank you timothy gitzel thank you operator thank you our next question is from brian macarthur from ubs please go ahead brian macarthur – ubs hi good morning probably it’s for grant can you just clarify this for the tax regarding recovery of  to  of that i mean i kind of get loss for all the ins and outs here is that including all of the adjustments you’ve had ie the right demand ph gle this year so it’s like a boxing or is it actually what you call a  to  recovery on a true adjusted number if i want to look at that way timothy gitzel yeah look at it the later way it’s the recovery based upon the adjusted so you’ll see that we have – as a normal course to our adjustments we adjusted for example the benefit of derivatives and then we also adjusted on an income tax basis and so the same thing for our guidance with respect to our effective tax rate brian macarthur – ubs so that’s increased quarter over quarter right you’re going to recover more than you were before timothy gitzel yeah brian macarthur – ubs and that is just – can you go through exactly why that is given your mix stuff going before probably not as profitable for your purchase stuff as it used to be so how that’s actually worked grant isaac well we’ve spent some time in the past obviously on it but let me just take a brief second i’m happy to discuss it more offline our consolidated effective tax rate which is being reflected in that outlook number reflects the basis we do in multiple jurisdictions one of the jurisdictions where we do a lot of business and spend a lot of money in is canada and so you see a jurisdiction on the fact of lot of production in canada lots spending in canada which carries with a balance of deductions if you will over the deductions available to any great payer in those jurisdictions and so as that balance changes over time and obviously we have less reliant on some foreign supplies notably the atu material than you’ve seen in the past that balance sheet of jurisdictions where we can probably take better advantages some of those deductions and you’re seeing that reflected in that forecast recovery operator thank you our next question is from edward sterck from bmo please go ahead edward sterck – bmo good morning everyone thanks for taking my question so i think i really got one such today which is just with regards to the future purchase commitments in the mda they are listed as being  billion over  through  and beyond i think out through  in fact i was just wondering that was the mix of uranium conversion services and also enrichment services and i was wondering what the split is between cameco sort of in uranium division internal uranium purchase program and then nukem timothy gitzel i’ll let the person responsible for those purchases ken seitz to answer that one kenneth seitz yeah well with respect to our own mix of purchases between enrichment conversion and uranium i think i would just say that you can assume that the absolute bulk of that is uranium and if you do a little bit math you can probably see very quickly that the absolute tip in making some assumptions about prices and so on that you can see very quickly that the absolute bulk of it is purchases of uranium sometimes we will identify what we believe is really attractively quite uranium but it’s only available at uf and so we’ll sometimes take that as converted uranium as well with respect to the split between cameco purchasing and nukem purchasing becomes a question of origination for one and both groups are going out and finding their own pockets to purchase so we’ll make conscious decisions about who is doing how much of what and so we have training company to trade buy ourselves uranium and we have cameco that’s doing purchasing as you see in our disclosure overtime for one of other reasons edward sterck – bmo okay thank you just a sort of mend this down a bit that the  million pounds equivalent not really riding from  through  how much of that would be sort of within cameco and cameco’s uranium division and how much would be attributable to nukem kenneth seitz that is all cameco edward sterck – bmo so nukem afford purchase agreement or commitment sales effort to that kenneth seitz um hmm edward sterck – bmo okay kenneth thank you very much indeed operator thank you the next question is from indiscernible from indiscernible please go ahead unidentified analyst hi it’s indiscernible here i’m just wondering if you look back on gle and the right down this quarter in your investments i’m just wondering if you reflect on this does it make you more cautious about investing outside your core businesses of mining uranium going forward or how do you think about this timothy gitzel you know not rohr i think that was an investment made probably back in  or ’ i think ‘ when moving across with sean quinn that still has some lacks in my view we took the financial provision and accounting provision and needed to do that but from a strategic pointofview that technology i think the work we’ve done on that over the last few years we’ve made a lot of progress progress to the extent that the doe is even today talking to ge about perhaps going that sometime in the future and reach tails with the doe so that’s life in this market today in  we didn’t have to say foresee the fukushima piece and the effect that would have we’re living through that now we’re  and half plus years into that but i can tell you what we’re optimistic about the future especially on the uranium front and so investments in pieces like gle i think that these may come around again and we’ll get back to that again so i don’t think  we’re cautious obviously you’re talking about the acquisitions of other sorts we’ve made some ones that we’re very happy with right now we’re not aggressive on that front but we’re always keeping an eye on the market so no i don’t think it changed our view operator operator instructions and our next question is from ben isaacson from scotiabank please go ahead ben isaacson – scotiabank thank you just a couple of followup questions first can you explain the  million increase in provisions you may please provide information timothy gitzel yeah so we had a project underway to look at the cleanup of one of our ongoing facilities and that’s our port hope conversion facility and it’s part of our larger port hope area initiative of that cleanup that needs stability and as we had done the work understand with those cleanup cost will be we then reflect that in our asset retirement’s obligation so largely what’s being reflected in that increase is enhance thinking on what the aro is for port hope conversion facility ben isaacson – scotiabank okay that’s great and then my last question is on cash outflow over the next couple of years you have about  million in purchase commitments in ‘‘ combined and then potentially another  million of outflow to the cra can you first give a better split on what you think could happen in ‘ versus ‘ and then part b if that is other deductions and tax loss carried forward that you anticipate would be available to help offset the potential outflow to the cra timothy gitzel with respect to the cra component of course we’re in a process with them right now with dispute resolution and certainly something we would like to see move quicker but it isn’t moving that quick and that actually prevents us from being able to be more clear on whether it’s a ‘ or a ‘ thing our view continues to be that our case is strong and we don’t view an adverse outcome but we eventually have to get to core and it’s the delays that we’re seeing there to prevent us from giving little more clarity on like that outflow between ’ and ’ both way ben isaacson – scotiabank okay on the deductions of potential carryforwards that could have offset some off that cash outflow timothy gitzel well we applied those it’s the reassessment comment and of course those are available after we’ve made in for example in capital deductions after we spend the money we can access those deductions so again it is dependent upon our economic activity and this jurisdiction in terms of what we can apply at that ben isaacson – scotiabank okay great and then just on the split on the purchase commitment if you have that available between ‘ and ‘ timothy gitzel well i don’t have that split before me when you think about those purchase commitments those will be commitments for where there probably is actually a contract to delivery into as well so we’ll perhaps outline and get a little more color on what that split looks like for the purchase commitment portion ben isaacson – scotiabank that’s great thank you very much timothy gitzel thanks ben operator thank you our next question is from oscar cabrera from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead oscar cabrera – bank of america merrill lynch thank you operator good afternoon everyone first of all congratulations on getting the cigar lake project going it’s been work of lot if you want to put in certain way so a question with regards to realized prices and you’ve been as it’s hitting from your longterm contracts and there was a question with regards to – i think it was greg that asked with regards to the marketing how much inventory there are you give us an idea just an approximation of how many of your competitors or what percentage of the market has longterm prices is benefiting from this because it just seems like one of the things that we notice that this spot market is not quite representative of the pain that some of these smaller producers might be feeling timothy gitzel oscar thanks it’s tim first he just said thanks for your comments on cigar lots of love in this room for cigar it’s been i think  some years  years that ore body was discovered in ’ and it hasn’t been worked on all the time but certainly the last few years look over bob steane under bob’s leadership we’ve made great progress and so this is an important month the th of october for any of us who have been involved with the project for many years it was a good day and so we really look forward to the future of that project that is a good project and it will be a great piece in the chemical portfolio for many years so thanks for that comment and of that kenneth may do the comment on second part kenneth seitz yes absolutely oscar yeah with respect to who among our competitors who would have a similar contract portfolio i’m afraid probably i have to talk to them but i think what i can say is of course we have seen some supply curtailment and i would offer that among our competitors who have shut in some supplies because of course they are exposed to having to sell in this bond market so in another word without that contractual protection and it is the case that those competitors would also have a difficult time marrying on new longterm contracts that would get them the covers that they would need in the sort of near term and so are near to medium term i should say so without knowing exactly what that mix looks like – of course we have a few other competitors who have some coverage but you certainly see some in the market at that moment that don’t oscar cabrera – bank of america merrill lynch right so if i may just add to that in terms of your supply demand when do you think requirements would be back to prefukushima levels based on what you are seeing in the market right now in the activity timothy gitzel yeah of course the demand line is up and sloping to the right i think it really becomes a question oscar of inventory levels and how well covered utilities are today so utilities that are consuming  million pounds would see that growing  a year it becomes the question then of at what pace the utilities depleting inventories if they are what is their coverage level looks like and that’s where we come back to over the near to medium term with japanese restarts and longterm contractings picking up again that we should see a price recovery but today utilities are reasonably well covered with respect to inventories and so demand remains somewhat discretionary oscar cabrera – bank of america merrill lynch okay and then if i may just add one more thing in your comments on underfeeding and this has been over the last couple of quarters and it was one the industry research providers had given out estimates for the next couple of years where on looking it had come from like  million to  million pounds to over  million pounds just wondering if you can comment on that timothy gitzel yeah it’s difficult to say we have our own estimates and if you’re talking about western enrichers it had a little more low in sight to that but the total level of underfeeding – let’s talk about what the russian enrichment fleet is doing and for a fleet that has historically operated at very low tookoffs tells that it’s already – it’s difficult to say what you can classify is underfeeding in that part of the world and so yeah today we would just say that there is quite bit of enricher underfeeding going on yet probably somewhere between  million and  million pounds a year across of all the enrichment fleets and we expect in time if japanese reactors restart we expect that to trailoff operator operator instructions and our next question is from greg barnes from td securities please go ahead unidentified analyst this is mark clarification for greg could you say on your dispute resolution discussion with the cra or is that still  timothy gitzel sorry just that word in a dispute with the map they have issued us reassessments over the years of  ph and we’re going through the process which is in place with that process we are through is the tax course unidentified analyst okay so there is no discussion underway right now just to let it out of core timothy gitzel i did not mean to suggest right and certain way of conversion with them as how you interpreted it unidentified analyst okay good that’s been how i interpreted with you cleared it up thanks great operator thank you our next question is from edward sterck from bmo please go ahead edward sterck – bmo thanks very much just a followup on the gle history has they given any indication of when they might review the  accounts timothy gitzel well you recall that earlier in the year we had talked about accelerated reassessment in the past we would have expected the  reassessment to show off at the end of this year but it showed up quite early with an indication that we would expect to receive  that is still our thinking and it’s still our guidance and our disclosure but as of yet we haven’t received it and have no information to say whether the likelihood has gone up or down it’s just that our current disclosure is we think they’re on this accelerated path but we just haven’t seen and it’s up again edward sterck – bmo that’s great thank you very much indeed timothy s gitzel thanks ed operator this concludes the questions from the telephone lines i would like to turn the meeting back over to mr tim gitzel for his closing remarks please go ahead timothy gitzel well thank you operator i think there is no question i think the industry continues to endure some tough times and we at cameco are not immune but we are weathering the storm and we’re trying to do that by being as flexible adaptive and efficient as possible and we remain confident in the future there is a clear progression of growth from the  reactors under construction to date even more clamped by  and even more outside that window today we know there are billions of dollars
