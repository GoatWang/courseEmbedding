hotels leader in sustainability we intend to encourage and promote ecological consciousness in every aspect of providing hospitality to our guests this is an evolving process of redesigning our operations to be increasingly friendly to the environment we lead boulder hotels in the effort to make travel sustainable and your stay carbonneutral how we express this intention we serve organic breakfaststhe only hotel or lodging place to do do in boulder county since  we commit one percent of annual revenues to capital expenditures which reduce the environmental impact of guest stays – see our environmental development plan since  we are a zero waste community partner with ecocycle wwwecocycleorg we recycle all our cans bottles plastics batteries and paper waste products we compost all of our biodegradable waste materials organic waste decomposes aerobically in a compost bin producing carbon dioxide and anaerobically in landfills anaerobic decomposition creates methane gas which causes more global warming than carbon dioxide since  we provide bath products from shikai and soap from kiss my face in  oz bottles which we refill other boulder hotels use disposable  oz bottles which end up in landfills since  our accommodations feature organic cotton sheets from coyuchi since  we ride bikes almost  of our employee commuting is by bike or foot our local grocery shopping is done with the briar rose biketrailer since  we plant native and xeric species and use mulches to conserve water since  we cut our lawn with a humanpowered reel mower the epa estimates that gaspowered lawnmowers in the us cause as much air pollution as  million latemodel cars since  we use compact fluorescent light cfl bulbs to reduce our electricity consumption since  overall our electricity consumption has decreased on a kilowatt basis during our tenure has been flat on a dollar basis and has decreased markedly on a perguestnight basis this manifests our intention to make the guest vacation travel as carbonneutral as possible in may of  we spent approximately  on electrical and lighting improvements in particular we a added some exterior lighting circuits that have dusktodawn sensors so that we dont rely on guests or staff to turn them off b replaced all incandescent bulbs with cfls in the guest rooms kitchen living and dining rooms basements and staff quarters c reduced the lumens of individual exterior light fixtures while increasing the number of fixtures so as not to lessen the security provided by the exterior lighting and d began experimentation with led bulbs for exterior lighting we run a  percent efficient gas furnace in the main house and energyefficient heat pumps in some guest rooms the heat pumps are used for both heating and cooling since  we use a highefficiency front loading washing machine to wash all bedding and linens and we do not use fabricsoftening dryer sheets since   use of paper containing recycled fiber for toilet and facial tissue and printer paper since  we increased the rvalue of our attic insulation to  in three of our five attics  and  we use ecofriendly cleaning products from ecoproducts seventh generation etc since  we provide filtered water in glass bottles in the guest room rather than offering mineral water in plastic bottles since  we send as little as possible to the landfill by donating usable items eg furniture dishes linens to community recycling programs the naropa freebox or the homeless shelter since  we use environmentally friendly novoc paints on nearly all interior surfaces since  we are the first member of the green hotel association from boulder county since  we engaged xcel energy in march  to provide an energy assessment of our facilities in this assessment xcel energy gave us good marks saying our energy usage was  percent below the lodging norm of  kbtu per square foot this was heartening to us as we know a most lodging occurs in bigger buildings with a lower ratio of windows to walls and a lower ratio of exterior walls to heated square footage and b we have an older structure with known issues in the building envelope that we have not fully addressed these items are significant drivers of energy consumption and despite these items we are already above average xcel energy recommended that we i do additional lighting retrofits of cfl bulbs which we have subsequently done  see above ii upgrade air conditioners we intend to do this but its quite expensive iii unplug a secondary refrigerator  we do not intend to do this as we perceive an operational need for the secondary refrigerator and iv wrap the water heaters with insulation we dont intend to wrap the water heaters because they are insulated and not warm to the touch so we dont think we are losing much heat also we think the assessment was too formulaic in one respect xcel energy universally labels fixes to the building envelope as low return on investment we disagree when the fixes occur in the context of a remodel and in the lodging business one remodels regularly hence we would like reserve some energy conservation funds for building envelope fixes we replaced the kitchen floor with linoleum in march  our previous floor was worn vinyl short for polyvinyl chloride the production of polyvinyl chloride causes more environmental damage than any other plastic we intend to retain a soft floor in the kitchen to lessen the stress of employees standing on hard surfaces for extended periods in contrast lineoleum is made of natural materials the primary constituent is linseed oil from the flax plant  linoleum is also durable  lasting four or five decades the installed cost was  mount meeker left  ft m and longs peak right ft  m longs peak is a famous er a  foot
