governance weaknesses business wire may    am edt sessa capital master lp sessa owner of  of the outstanding common shares of ashford hospitality prime inc nyseahp ashford prime or the company today commented on the companys announcement of a series of lastminute governance proposals that sessa believes will do little to address the issues that have plagued ashford prime since its  spinoff sessa believes the incumbent directors newest proposal that monty bennett step down as ceo is merely a ruse to suggest that real governance changes are underway at most companies a ceo change would be meaningful but this is not the case at ashford prime where the incumbent directors relinquished their power to appoint the ceo less than a year ago by approving a highly unusual contractual arrangement in sessas view changing the companys ceo will be merely symbolic because by contract any ceo will be appointed by ashford inc and therefore beholden to monty bennett in his role as ashford incs chairman and ceo sessa believes this arrangement renders the companys latest proposal a mere cosmetic change that leaves monty bennetts power over ashford prime unchecked sessa also questions the incumbent directors campaign promise that they might appoint new independent directors if they are reelected sessa agrees that truly independent directors are needed at ashford prime but sessa believes that the governance problem at ashford prime isnt an insufficient number of directors but rather the conflicts of the existing independent directors the incumbent directors were all identified by chairman bennett and have personal professional and financial intersections with him and his other companies a larger board would be unwieldy in size more expensive and chosen by incumbent directors who have already failed to protect shareholders interests sessa believes that shareholders should be wary of director additions sourced by a board that includes a director who is a direct subordinate of chairman bennett and has worked for him for nearly  years a high school friend of more than  years of chairman bennett who serves on the companys compensation committee a director whose independence was questioned by riskmetrics while serving as a director of ashford primes predecessor because of his receipt of a  bonus a director whose affiliated company sold assets to ashford primes predecessor which later took  million in impairment charges on the purchase and two political cronies of chairman bennett texas state representatives who raised so much campaign money from chairman bennett that he was a leading individual donor to each for shareholders who like sessa believe new independent directors are needed electing sessas highly qualified nominees on june  is a more direct and immediate path to accomplish this objective if you liked this article you might like tradeideas ashford hospitality prime ahp is todays weak on high relative volume stock

compare all chatter on the street sessa capital one of ashford hospitality primes largest shareholders nominates control slate of five highly qualified director candidates for election to board at  annual meeting business wire jan    am est sessa capital master lp sessa owner of  of the outstanding common shares of ashford hospitality prime inc nyseahp ashford prime or the company and ashford primes third largest shareholder today announced it will nominate a slate of five highlyqualified independent directors for election at the companys  annual meeting of stockholders sessas nominees will be larry cunningham phil livingston john petry daniel silvers and chris wheeler sessa believes corporate governance failures have been an unshakable burden on ashford prime since it started trading as a public company in november  and have only worsened over time therefore sessa has concluded that a sale process on a level playing field for all potential bidders is the best way to maximize value for all shareholders despite a brief period of outperformance following the companys announcement of its decision to pursue strategic alternatives the stock has since resumed the downward slide it has exhibited since it started trading additionally since sessas initial investment the company has engaged in a number of conflictofinterest transactions reflecting poor corporate governance and remained virtually silent on the status of the strategic review process announced by the company on august   the companys actions appear to benefit monty bennett the chairman and ceo of the company and chairman and ceo of its external manager ashford inc at the expense of all shareholders despite sessas repeated calls for the company to address its corporate governance deficiencies and reverse the series of shareholderunfriendly actions that have exacerbated the conflicts of interest inherent in ashford primes organizational structure the company has only made matters worse since june  ashford prime has amended its advisory agreement with ashford inc an entity dominated by mr bennett in an attempt to impose a large termination fee if shareholders elect directors not acceptable to ashford inc completed a share issuance dilutive to the chairmans own subsequent estimate of nav  in order to purchase an asset at a cap rate much richer than its own properties are valued by the market and purchased  million of stock in ashford inc at a  premium at the time and an  premium to yesterdays close the termination fee payable to ashford inc undercuts the integrity of the strategic review process management has estimated the termination fee to be up to  per share or nearly  of the companys  closing share price as of january   quite simply this fee makes a fair strategic process virtually impossible the estimated fee is about  times the companys annualized base advisory fee paid to ashford inc sessa believes a customary fee in the industry would be less than  that amount if managements numbers are correct the company would likely pay more to terminate the advisory agreement than it would pay in base fees for the remainder of the agreements entire year
