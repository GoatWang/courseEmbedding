user story mapping tips forget your product – colin j riddell – mediumhomepagesign in  sign upcolin j riddellblockedunblockfollowfollowingi am a dedicated technologist product manager and startup enthusiast devoted to products aspiring entrepreneur i build amazing teams at joyful companiesaug   user story mapping tips forget your productcredit matt nelson chalkthoughtscomuser story mapping is awesome however i have sometimes found that a story mapping session to put through a revision or improvement to a feature can be painful because it’s so easy to let the how the product currently works cloud the judgement and creative part on how it could or should workproduct owners and product managers struggle with this if they have a deep knowledge of the products internals but also i found that technical team members struggle with this in particular as their knowledge of the innards is often more detailed if a system is complex it can be harder to think from the point of view of a blank slate some of the problems i have ran into when doing that“but the system currently works like this”“we can’t do that because currently we do this”“that wont work because of current limitation in how the database is structured”what’s happening here is a conversation that’s sooo easy to fall into but it simply shouldn’t be happening when story mapping even if it’s to improve a current feature in your product you shouldn’t be thinking about the current limitations or parameters set out by the version you are trying to improve you should be thinking about everything you want that feature to do even if you hit on features that are already implementedso i have jotted down my ideas to help keep you and your team on track when story mapping for improving your product featuresmapping curator every couple of minutes you or someone in the group should remind the team that the goal is to forget about how the feature currently works and focus on the perfect productforget about the product forget about everything that’s currently implemented you should encourage everyone in the session to do that too think about that feature as if you were brainstorming and story mapping it for the first timego higher level if you are struggling to keep things on track then try going higher level for example if you’re adding a new feature to the payment process of your ecommerce product — let’s say for example adding paypal integration and a couple of other things — then name the entire story map “payment process” instead of “paypal integration” avoid using the epic level feature name for the entire story map — that will encourage you to think about the entire payment process rather than just parts of it that will help you get most out of that feature and help you realise any missed interactions between that and other featuresas a persona i want some feature so that achieve something back to story mapping basics even if you don’t write it on every card make sure every card has been thought about from the users point of view — even better if you have a specific persona to work withhuge user story maps headline the existing features if the map is becoming huge because you are mapping existing features that’s ok you could maybe not fill out columns for features you know don’t need to changeforget about the backend forget about the database this is user story mapping keep reminding yourself that you are trying to build a plan on what the product should look like from the users point of view“quality in a service or product is not what you put into it it is what the client or customer gets out of it” peter druckerstick up all stories and ideas never don’t stick something if you hear yourself or someone else saying “i have an idea but i won’t put it up” — slap yourself it needs to go up whether it’s part of your mvp or if it’s realistically never going to get put into your product it doesn’t matter you are user story mapping to brainstorm and plan your product and you want your product to be as brilliant as you and your team can build it once all the stories are up and you are happy with that — then you can start to slice off versions and negotiate what’s in your mvp v v etckeep it lean if you let the thoughts of the current implementation hold you back you won’t be able to make progress with  loop as taught in eric ries iconic book the lean startupbrainstorm ideas then prioritise like i mentioned before stick all stories up put them somewhere do that first — then and only then slice of different versionsgenerally keep in mind that even though you are working to improve a certain feature of your product doing that with knowledge of how it currently functions doesn’t help improve the potential of your product at this stage you want the product to be as awesome as it can be and you want the user story mapping process to be as blue sky as possible knowledge on existing features can come after you have obtained all the ideas on how to improve the product — and the only way to do that is to start with a clean slate every timei am a dedicated product manager and technologist working in glasgow scotland i am devoted to amazing

experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off

inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily
