bond buyer’s national outlook  conference held february  in new york city  a highly debated topic on his panel “municipal advisors assuming a more regulated role” was the independent registered municipal advisor or irma exemption part of the sec’s municipal advisor or ma registration rule which went into effect last year  the exemption allows an underwriter to avoid having to register as a ma as long as the issuer retains as its own ma an advisor that doesn’t have ties to an underwriting firm and says that it will rely on the ma’s advice    mr peyser discussed tweaking the exemption including the idea that the sec grant another exemption for sophisticated issuers which have historically used irmas a suggestion that has garnered support from the industry  regulators recognized that the new ma rules may still have to be developed as apparent by sec chief counsel rebecca olsen’s statement there was “a lot of work left to do” on the rules in  for more information on this panel and on the bond buyer’s national outlook  conference please see the article “municipal advisors concerned about irma exemption” published in the february    the bond buyer public resources advisory
