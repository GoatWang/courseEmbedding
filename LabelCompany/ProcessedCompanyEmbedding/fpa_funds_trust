you could lose money by investing in the fund one of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular stock owned by the fund fund shares or stocks in general may fall in value there can be no assurance that the funds investment objective will be achieved the fund may invest in securities issued by companies concentrated in a particular industry or country the fund may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in a fund containing securities of nonus issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting nonus issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries the fund is more susceptible to the economic market regulatory political natural disasters and local risks of the asia pacific region than a fund that is more geographically diversified the region has historically been highly dependent on global trade with nations taking strong roles in both the importing and exporting of goods such a relationship creates a risk with this dependency on global growth varying levels of accounting and disclosure standards restrictions on foreign ownership minority ownership rights and corporate governance standards are also common for the region the fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market the fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than inkind securities as a result the fund may be less taxefficient the fund is classified as nondiversified and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers first trust
