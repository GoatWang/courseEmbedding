investing in  and accelerating the growth of  brands that offer superior products and compelling unit economics “nrd capital is doing what it set out to do from beginning” said aziz hashim nrd capital founder and managing partner “we are finding brands with compelling unit economics and partnering with their existing management teams to maximize the impact that the brand can have through franchising our approach to private equity is unlike anything in the space and it’s proving to be extremely fruitful nrd represents the next generation of private equity with a total alignment of interests among the fund’s operationsminded partners the multiunit franchisees who constitute the majority of fund investors and the management teams of its portfolio companies hashim went on to say

block and displayed front and center at every del taco—for about five bucks it’s the embodiment of del taco’s effort to thread the needle between quickservice and fastcasual—to beat taco bell on price and yet rival chipotle on food quality and let’s stipulate this is setting aside chipotle’s recent food safety stumbles that strategy to become “qsrplus” as analysts and del taco’s ceo paul murphy himself have started to say was developed after intense research starting in  when murphy and his team realized the yearold brand just wasn’t cutting it with millennials they had full kitchens in every restaurant and cooked food the oldfashioned way but they weren’t telling customers about it so they got zero credit so they researched mcdonald’s and chickfila and jack in the box interviewing former executives and poring over public documents to see what those brands did to reinvent “the companies we thought were successful didn’t do one thing” murphy says “they really signaled change in everything that touches the customer” the eventual strategy called “combined solutions” was good enough to convince their longsuffering owners led by private equity firm goldman sachs to recapitalize the brand in  that means put in more money they would ultimately hold del taco for  long years and murphy gives them credit “they were willing to give us the time and money to execute the strategy” he says it was also enough to attract the attention of larry levy the chicago restaurant tycoon who spent several months visiting del taco restaurants and putting together investors ultimately winning the unit del taco last june via a spac that stands for special purchase acquisition company which is a littleused vehicle these days “you see the spac’s are targeting businesses that are built out not purely speculative” like in the past murphy says “it was a perfect match” the deal came in two steps first the levy family and investors bought  million of del taco common stock  percent of the company and increased senior debt by  million under the existing credit agreement with ge capital those proceeds were used to retire  million in senior debt in step two a levy acquisition subsidiary merged into del taco taking the company public for a  million valuation to read the complete article click here atlanta – nrd capital management “nrd” via its initial investment fund nrd capital partners i lp announced its first acquisition with the purchase of frisch’s restaurants a unit cincinnatibased brand for approximately  million nrd capital partners is the first franchiseesponsored and managed investment fund focused on investing in  and accelerating the growth of – brands that offer superior products and compelling unit economics this is the right transaction for the company said retiring frisch’s ceo craig maier frisch’s has been a family operated business since my grandfather opened our first drivein in  on behalf of my entire family i’d like to thank our loyal customers for allowing us to serve them ever since with its first acquisition complete nrd’s founder and managing partner aziz hashim said his team’s focus is now turning toward growth of frisch’s by positioning the brand for additional operators to join and accelerate new development during the last year our team thoroughly analyzed many potential acquisitions looking for a successful brand that had tremendous potential and which could benefit from our expertise” hashim said “we settled on frisch’s because we believe it is perfectly positioned for growth and because its business model is friendly to multiunit franchisee expansion our team is very excited about the frisch’s acquisition we already have a second acquisition in process now and i have been very pleased with the reception nrd has had in the ma market hashim said when isaac singer created a business model to speed up the production and distribution of his patented widelyused sewing machines in the early s the world was first introduced to the newfound concept of franchising by the late s with the advent of fast food restaurants franchising began to pick up steam and ever since the number of franchised businesses steadily grew today there are more than  franchise opportunities worldwide in the over  trillion industry yet after all these decades it was only two years ago that the modern franchise world welcomed its first franchiseesponsored and managed equity fund nrd capital boasting a seasoned team with more than  years of franchise experience—from single store operations to public company management—the company focuses on acquiring positioning and growing small to mediumsized brands for accelerated success in its first year nrd capital had already acquired two major franchises—first frisch’s restaurants inc and most recently fuzzy’s taco shop chances are those familiar with the franchising world will recognize this franchisee fund’s founder and managing partner—aziz hashim and there is also a good chance that those people will be quick to say that thanks to hashim multibrand and multiunit franchise development as we know it is being rewritten “aziz hashim is the embodiment of a shifting balance of power over the last few years that puts many multiunit operators on equal footing with and in many cases several rungs above the franchisor whose stores they buy and whose rules they follow” wrote beth ewen editor of the franchise times “hashim is a man in franchising to be reckoned with” for hashim it all started with the founding of nrd holdings in  when he opened his first kfc restaurant in atlanta he soon opened a subway next door fast forward three years and he had built up a unit empire which he quickly grew to more than  units but it was never just about building
