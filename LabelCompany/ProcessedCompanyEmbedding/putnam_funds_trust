‘covered security’ is one traded nationally and listed on a regulated national exchange” dabit supra at  slip op at – footnotes omitted     petitioners are eight groups of investors holding mutual fund shares who filed separate actions in illinois state courts each group seeking to represent a class of investors allegedly injured by devaluation of their holdings by respondents mutual funds investment advisors and an insurance company hereinafter collectively the funds the eight complaints asserted only statelaw claims such as negligence and breach of fiduciary duty     the funds filed notices of removal to federal district court in each case stating among other things that the actions were removable under and precluded by the act once in the district court however the investors argued that the cases should be remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and in separate orders the district court for the southern district of illinois remanded each case to state court on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on removal because the act did not preclude the investors’ claims since the investors were said to have been injured as “holders” of mutual fund shares not purchasers or sellers the district court reasoned their claims did not satisfy the “in connection with the purchase or sale” requirement of the act’s preclusion provision §pb and the claims could therefore proceed in state court the district court did not decide whether the claims otherwise met the act’s conditions for preclusion     the funds filed notices of appeal from the remand orders and in one of the cases kircher v putnam funds trust the seventh circuit issued an opinion addressing the threshold question of its appellate jurisdiction  f d   the court of appeals acknowledged that  u s c §d bars review of district court orders remanding for lack of subject matter jurisdiction  f d at  citing gravitt v southwestern bell telephone co  u s   per curiam but decided that the district court had the last word neither on the characterization of its decision as jurisdictional nor on the correctness of its conclusion that remand was required see  f d at      the court of appeals considered all covered class actions involving covered securities whether precluded or not to be removable under the act and for that reason thought the preclusion issue to be distinct from the jurisdictional issue of whether the case belonged in federal court at all id at – in the view of the court of appeals if the district court remanded because for example the class comprised too few investors to make the case a covered class action that would be a jurisdictional decision that the case had been removed improperly and the order would therefore be unreviewable in accordance with §d id at  but the court held that orders remanding “properly removed” suits as not precluded by the act are substantive “unaffected by §d” id at  and therefore subject to appellate jurisdiction in the normal course     as the court of appeals put it once the district court had made that substantive decision of no preclusion in this case it was time for the court to bow out not because it had lacked “adjudicatory competence” to begin with but because it had completed its work “once a court does all that the statute authorizes there is no adjudicatory competence to do more that is not the ‘lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction’ that authorizes a remand otherwise every federal suit having been decided on the merits would be dismissed ‘for lack of jurisdiction’ because the court’s job was finished” id at  this remand the court concluded was therefore not for want of jurisdiction and review was not barred by §d     to satisfy itself that its decision made “practical sense” the court proposed that the act reserves to the federal judiciary the exclusive authority to make the preclusion decision ibid treating remand orders in this context as immunized from appeal by §d would thus mean that “a major substantive issue in the case would escape review” since it would not be open to resolution in the state court subject to review by this court ibid     the seventh circuit subsequently consolidated the funds’ appeals and decided on the merits that the act does preclude the investors’ claims  f d   we granted certiorari to resolve a split of authority on the question whether §d bars review of remand orders in cases removed under the act  u s   and we now vacate for want of jurisdiction on the part of the court of appeals ii     the policy of congress opposes “interruption of the litigation of the merits of a removed cause by prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed” united states v rice  u s     and nearly three years of jurisdictional advocacy in the cases before us confirm the congressional wisdom for over a century now statutes have accordingly limited the power of federal appellate courts to review orders remanding cases removed by defendants from state to federal court see id at – thermtron products inc v hermansdorfer  u s  –   the current incarnation is  u s c §d which provides that an “order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise” in thermtron we held that the bar of §d applies only to remands based on the grounds specified in §c that is a defect in removal procedure or lack of subject matter jurisdiction  u s at – see also things remembered inc v petrarca  u s  –   so we have approved appellate review of a remand expressly based on the district court’s crowded docket see thermtron supra at – and one based on abstention under burford v sun oil co  u s    see quackenbush v allstate ins co  u s  –   but we have relentlessly repeated that “any remand order issued on the grounds specified in §c is immunized from all forms of appellate review whether or not that order might be deemed erroneous by an appellate court” thermtron  u s at  see also id at  “if a trial judge purports to remand a case on the ground that it was removed ‘improvidently and without jurisdiction’ his order is not subject to challenge in the court of appeals” quoting §c  ed     the bar of §d applies equally to cases removed under the general removal statute § and to those removed under other provisions see things remembered inc supra at  and the force of the bar is not subject to any statutory exception that might cover this case ostensibly then §d stands in the way of reviewing the district court’s orders of remand in the present cases the district court said that it was remanding for lack of jurisdiction an unreviewable ground and even if it is permissible to look beyond the court’s own label the orders are unmistakably premised on the view that removal jurisdiction under  u s c §pc is limited to cases precluded by §pb on the district court’s understanding that “holder” claims are not subject to preclusion under §pb of the act the court had no subject matter jurisdiction since there was no indication that removal jurisdiction might exist on some ground other than §pc complete diversity for example the remand orders were necessarily based on the trial court’s conclusion that jurisdiction under §pc was wanting and “where the order is based on one of the grounds enumerated in  u s c §c review is unavailable no matter how plain the legal error in ordering the remand” briscoe v bell  u s  – n      the court of appeals did not of course overlook the cases holding that even a remand premised on an erroneous conclusion of no jurisdiction is unappealable it relied instead on cases like kontrick v ryan  u s    and scarborough v principi  u s    which observed that some rulings loosely called jurisdictional are patently not jurisdictional in the strict sense see  f d at  citing kontrick supra scarborough supra the appeals court saw this as such a case it understood that a district court had removal jurisdiction over any covered action under subsection c with the consequence that a subsequent order dismissing because of preclusion under subsection b or remanding because the action was not precluded rested simply on an application of substantive law under subsection b law that was not jurisdictional at all     we think however that the district court was correct in understanding its remand order to be dictated by its finding that it lacked removal jurisdiction unlike the court of appeals we read authorization for the removal in subsection c on which the district court’s jurisdiction depends as confined to cases “set forth in subsection b” §pc namely those with claims of untruth manipulation and so on the quoted phrase immediately follows the subsection c language describing removable cases as covered class actions involving covered securities and the language has no apparent function unless it limits removal to covered class actions involving claims like untruth or deception and legislative history tends to show that this was just what congress understood see s rep no – p   §pc “provides that any class action described in subsection b that is brought in a state court shall be removable to federal district court and may be dismissed pursuant to the provisions of subsection b” h r rep no – p   same     the funds argue that removal jurisdiction is broader by emphasizing the adjective that introduces subsection c “any” covered action §pc but that suggestion would be persuasive only if we stopped reading right there and we do not stop there we do not read statutes in little bites and as just noted if we did read the removal power that broadly there would be no point to the phrase “as set forth in subsection b” for subsection b cases would be removable anyway as a subset of covered class actions ibid the funds purport to counter this objection with their argument that on our reading the last phrase of subsection c is redundant in providing that removed cases “shall be subject to subsection b” since subsection b cases would in any event be so subject ibid the funds are in fact right about that redundancy but the point does not count for their side because the phrase is redundant on their reading too any subsection b case removed as falling within the broad category of covered class actions would be treated in accordance with subsection b if the subsection applied to that case in sum we see no reason to reject the straightforward reading removal and jurisdiction to deal with removed cases is limited to those precluded by the terms of subsection b     once removal jurisdiction under subsection c is understood to be restricted to precluded actions defined by subsection b a motion to remand claiming the action is not precluded must be seen as posing a jurisdictional issue if the action is precluded neither the district court nor the state court may entertain it and the proper course is to dismiss if the action is not precluded the federal court likewise has no jurisdiction to touch the case on the merits and the proper course is to remand to the state court that can deal with it in either event as the court of appeals said the district court’s order comes because its adjudicatory power has been exercised and its work is done but its adjudicatory power is simply its authority to determine its own jurisdiction to deal further with the case see united states v shipp  u s    opinion for the court by holmes j a federal court “necessarily has jurisdiction to decide whether the case is properly before it” the work done is jurisdictional as is the conclusion reached and the order implementing it iii     we have yet to deal with one objection to our application of §d which if welltaken would be a serious one the seventh circuit’s reading of subsection c so as to treat the application of the preclusion rule as nonjurisdictional was in part motivated by its assumption that the act gives federal courts exclusive jurisdiction to decide the preclusion issue if that is so and §d applies a remand order based on a finding that an action is not precluded would arguably be immune from review this is what the funds in effect contend here when they say that a district court’s finding of no subsection b preclusion would collaterally estop the state court on remand the district court would have the last word and of course the funds’ discomfort is made acute by our recent decision in dabit which expressly disavows the district court’s limited view of the scope of subsection b preclusion     but a district court does not have the last word on preclusion under the act for nothing in the act gives the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over preclusion decisions a covered action is removable if it is precluded and a defendant can enlist the federal judiciary to decide preclusion but a defendant can elect to leave a case where the plaintiff filed it and trust the state court an equally competent body see missouri pacific r co v fitzgerald  u s     to make the preclusion determination     and what a state court could do in the first place it may also do on remand in this case the funds can presently argue the significance of dabit and ask for dismissal on grounds of preclusion when they return to the state court collateral estoppel should be no bar to such a revisitation of the preclusion issue given that §d prevents the funds from appealing the district court’s decision see standefer v united states  u s    “contemporary principles of collateral estoppel … strongly militate against giving an unreviewable judgment preclusive effect” citing restatement second of judgments § tent draft no   see also restatement second of judgments §  “although an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment and the determination is essential to the judgment relitigation of the issue in a subsequent action between the parties is not precluded when the party against whom preclusion is sought could not as a matter of law have obtained review of the judgment in the initial action” while the state court cannot review the decision to remand in an appellate way it is perfectly free to reject the remanding court’s reasoning as we explained over a century ago in missouri pacific railway “as to applications for removal on the ground that the cause arose under the constitution laws or treaties of the united states” the finality accorded remand orders is appropriate because questions of this character “if decided against the claimant” in state court are “open to revision … irrespective of the ruling of the federal court in that regard in the matter of removal”  u s at  nor is there any reason to see things differently just because the remand’s basis coincides entirely with the merits of the federal question it is only the forum designation that is conclusive here we have no reason to doubt that the state court will duly apply dabit’s holding that holder claims are embraced by subsection b but any claim of error on that point can be considered on review by this court see franchise tax bd of cal v construction laborers vacation trust for southern cal  u s   n   “if the state courts reject a claim of federal preemption that decision may ultimately be reviewed on appeal by this court” citing fidelity fed sav  loan assn v de la cuesta  u s    iv     we hold that the act does not exempt remand orders from  u s c §d and its general rule of nonappealability we therefore vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction it is so ordered notes  “no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging— “ an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or “ that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security”  stat  codified at  u s c §pb the preclusion provision is often called a preemption provision the act however does not itself displace state law with federal law but makes some statelaw claims nonactionable through the class action device in federal as well as state court see merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc v dabit  u s    slip op at  “the act does not deny any individual plaintiff or indeed any group of fewer than  plaintiffs the right to enforce any statelaw cause of action that may exist”  “any covered class action brought in any state court involving a covered security as set forth in subsection b of this section shall be removable to the federal district court for the district in which the action is pending and shall be subject to subsection b of this section”  stat  codified at  u s c §pc  the act amends “in substantially identical ways” dabit supra at  n  slip op at  n  both the securities act of   stat  and the securities exchange act of   stat  for the sake of simplicity the seventh circuit relied exclusively on the amendments to the securities act of  and for ease of reference we will do the same  the investors claim that the funds facilitated the practice of “market timing” whereby traders of mutual fund shares exploit brief discrepancies between the stock prices used to calculate the shares’ value once a day and the prices at which those stocks are actually trading in the interim brief for petitioners  the investors say that market timing is harmful to longterm holders of mutual fund shares and that the funds negligently or recklessly failed to adopt procedures to protect the value of the investors’ longterm investments  as discussed in part iii infra we have since rejected this reasoning see dabit supra at  slip op at   compare  f d  ca  case below with spielman v merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc  f d  ca  abada v charles schwab  co  f d  ca  williams v afc enterprises inc  f d  ca   title  §d specifically excepts certain civil rights actions from its bar cf §  “absent a clear statutory command to the contrary we assume that congress is aware of the universality of the practice of denying appellate review of remand orders when congress creates a new ground for removal” things remembered  u s at  internal quotation marks omitted like  u s c §pc congress has when it wished expressly made  u s c §d inapplicable to particular remand orders see eg §d  u s c §alc §bc  u s c §d cf n  supra there is no such “clear statutory command” here and that silence tells us we must look to  u s c §d to determine the reviewability of remand orders under the act  we take a pass on justice scalia’s position that we may not look beyond the label see post at  the result here is the same whether we look near or far  these cases raise exclusively statelaw claims seeking damages insufficient to satisfy the amountincontroversy requirement of  u s c § in those instances in which the funds asserted diversity as a basis for subject matter jurisdiction the district court determined that no named plaintiff had a claim that met §’s  threshold see eg parthasarthy v t rowe price international funds inc no –cv––drh sd ill jan   app to pet for cert a–a spurgeon v pacific life ins co no –cv––mjr sd ill june   app to pet for cert a–a  like the court of appeals here we said in dabit that a “key provision of the act makes all ‘covered class actions’ filed in state court removable”  u s at  n  slip op at  n  quoting  stat  we sketched the removal provision in broad strokes then because the question of its scope was not before us now that it is we speak more cautiously  the funds argue  u s c §p confers jurisdiction greater than that necessary to render the preclusion decision analogizing §pc to the federal officer removal statute  u s c §a if there is any colorable claim that an action is precluded the argument goes the district court can keep the case for adjudication even after concluding on the merits that the statelaw claims are not precluded but because it has discretion to keep the case or remand to state court a remand is not jurisdictional and hence is reviewable the argument is flawed for two reasons the district court here did not indicate it thought there was any basis to keep the case for further development right or wrong it understood that it was making a jurisdictional ruling nor is the analogy with federal officer cases sound section a is an exception to the “wellpleaded complaint” rule under which absent diversity “a defendant may not remove a case to federal court unless the plaintiff’s complaint establishes that the case ‘arises under’ federal law” franchise tax bd of cal v construction laborers vacation trust for southern cal  u s    emphasis deleted the federal officer removal statute allows “suits against federal officers to be removed despite the nonfederal cast of the complaint” jefferson county v acker  u s     and reflects a congressional policy that “federal officers and indeed the federal government itself require the protection of a federal forum” willingham v morgan  u s     an officer’s federal defense need be only colorable to assure the federal court that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate the case see acker supra at  the funds assert that a preclusion defense need be only colorable as well but the act is different it avails a defendant of a federal forum in contemplation not of further litigation over the merits of a claim brought in state court but of termination of the proceedings altogether and a merely colorable claim of preclusion does not satisfy a district court that it may dismiss a case as precluded by the act there is no room for such a case to exist in a limbo of colorable preclusion if a claim is precluded it “may not be maintained”  u s c §pb and if the claim is not the federal courts no longer have any business being involved as there is no longer any federal question on which to moor the district court’s jurisdiction nor has congress expressed in the act as it did with  u s c §a any policy of having particular suits tried in a federal court there is no indication whatsoever in the act that apart from its purpose to preclude certain vexing statelaw class actions congress intended to add other statelaw cases to the federal dockets and there is no apparent federal interest in spending time on such cases akin to the interest in adjudicating suits against federal officers  the funds suggest in the alternative that appellate jurisdiction in this case was proper under waco v united states fidelity  guaranty co  u s    without passing on the continued vitality of that case in light of §d we note that on its own terms it is distinguishable in waco a case was removed to federal court on an invocation of diversity jurisdiction id at  and the district court thereafter “entered a single decree embodying … separate orders” id at  in one order the district court dismissed a crosscomplaint against one party in another the district court concluded that because of the dismissal there was no diversity of citizenship and it thus lacked jurisdiction and so it remanded the case to state court an appeal was taken from the order of dismissal this court determined that the appeal would lie because “the decree of dismissal preceded that of remand” and because the district court’s order of dismissal was conclusive upon the parties id at  we noted that a “reversal of the dismissal cannot affect the order of remand but it will at least if the dismissal … was erroneous remit the entire controversy with the previously dismissed party still a party to the state court for … further proceedings” id at – the order appealed in waco was not a remand order the order here is and thus falls within §d’s bar on appeals of “an order remanding a case” to state court moreover the funds do not explain how to reconcile their argument with waco’s acknowledgement that the order of remand “cannot be affected” notwithstanding any reversal of a separate order id at  the district court’s remand order here cannot be disaggregated as the waco orders could and if the seventh circuit’s preclusion decision stands there is nothing to remand to state court  modern usage calls for the descriptive term “issue preclusion” in place of “collateral estoppel” but we are backsliders out of pity for the tired reader “preclusion” by statutory fiat is enough preclusion for one opinion  the parties further dispute whether the investors’ claims satisfy the other  u s c §pb preclusion prerequisites particularly the allegation of fraud the investors take issue with the seventh circuit’s characterization of their claims as charging fraud or manipulation not mismanagement because the court of appeals lacked appellate jurisdiction its reading of the investors’ litigation position is not binding in future proceedings and is open to
