potential utility of dcrphxc for treating all forms of primary hyperoxaluria ph dicerna pharmaceuticals inc presents new preclinical data suggesting the potential utility of dcrphxc jul   dicerna pharmaceuticals inc presented on july   new preclinical data suggesting the potential utility of dcrphxc a galxc™based investigational therapy for treating all forms of primary hyperoxaluria ph in a series of presentations at the th international workshop on primary hyperoxaluria for professionals patients and families in tenerife spain from july   dicerna scientists presented research from animal models demonstrating how dcrphxc inhibits the lactate dehydrogenase a ldha gene which dicerna has identified as potentially being an optimal therapeutic target in patients with ph a group of severe rare inherited disorders of the liver that often result in kidney failure in patients with ph the liver overproduces oxalate a metabolite that can accumulate throughout the body and particularly in the kidneys often resulting in endstage renal disease esrd and the need for both kidney and liver transplants dcrphxc the lead investigational product candidate in dicernas pipeline of therapies targeting rare diseases of the liver yields potent liverspecific ldha inhibition in animal models of ph an effect that reduces oxalate to nearnormal levels which may prevent the damage caused to kidneys and other organs by oxalate accumulation at the th international workshop dicerna presented research findings on ldha inhibition which was shown in animal models to reduce oxalate to normal or nearnormal levels in ph types   and ethylene glycolinduced ph in contrast research findings showed that inhibiting the enzyme glycolate oxidase go  a common target of investigational therapies for ph including dicerna’s earlier ivadministered program for ph  does not appear to have the potential to treat ph or iph in animal models of ph and ethylene glycolinduced ph ldha knockdown with dcrphxc nearly normalized oxalate levels within onemonth posttreatment whereas oxalate levels remained unchanged and elevated in animals receiving gotargeted therapy ldha reduction has a linear correlation with oxalate reduction and offers a minimal metabolic intervention unlike go reduction these benefits of ldha inhibition may translate into consistent therapeutic activity even in the event of a missed dose there are numerous case reports of ldha deficiency naturally occurring in humans with no reported adverse effects due to deficiency in the liver dcrphxc is the most advanced product candidate utilizing dicerna’s galxc technology a proprietary platform that advances the development of nextgeneration rnaibased therapies designed to silence diseasedriving genes in the liver galxc compounds are intended to be broadly applicable across multiple therapeutic areas including rare diseases chronic liver diseases cardiovascular diseases and viral infectious diseases galxc enables subcutaneous delivery of rnai therapies to hepatocytes in the liver and offers several distinct potential benefits as extensively demonstrated in various animal models such benefits could include potent silencing of ldha and other genes highly specific targeting to hepatocytes sparing other cell types in the body a long duration of action and a simple infrequent dosing regimen the th international workshop also featured an update from the primary hyperoxaluria observational study phyos an international multicenter study in patients with ph that is collecting data on key biochemical parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of ph to better understand the baseline disease state knowledge that will help guide longterm drug development plans the study’s primary objective is to measure changes in oxalate glycolate and other metabolites over a sixmonth period in patients with ph in a poster presentation phyos investigators reported data from  enrolled patients with a median age at screening of  years range  years the patients had been diagnosed at a median age of  years range  years and  patients  had a medical history of renal stones over the sixmonth observation period the variability coefficient of variation between hour urine measurements of oxalate at different time points was  these data will help the dicerna clinical team design a clinical study using hour urinary oxalate excretion as a surrogate marker for clinical benefit dicerna pharmaceuticals inc appoints ralf rosskamp as chief medical officer effective june   jun   dicerna pharmaceuticals inc

diseases and viral infectious diseases our optimized subcutaneously administered galxctm molecules are designed to potently and selectively silence genes that are implicated in these disorders we have qualified dozens of diseaseassociated genes in clinical indications where we believe an rnaibased inhibitor may provide substantial benefit to patients providing expansive therapeutic opportunities in

successful silencing of the target gene will provide substantial benefit to patients and for which we can move rapidly through the drug approval process whether focusing on our core area of rare
