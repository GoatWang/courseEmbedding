furniture so he bought a  skill saw some stain and wood and built a coffee table in his garage he listed the coffee table online and although that first table didnt sell for a month orders started flowing in for dining tables benches night stands and more it was obvious people wanted solid attractive realwood furniture at an affordable price smith quickly partnered with college friend james
