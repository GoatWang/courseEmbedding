knights is a member of the government investigations  white collar defense practice group where he represents individuals and businesses across a variety of industries in connection with matters involving the antikickback statute the false claims act and other federal and state laws prior to joining nixon peabody mark served as a law clerk for judge mary beck briscoe of the us court of appeals for the tenth circuit and chief judge joseph laplante of the us district court for the district of new hampshire and was an associate at goodwin where he focused on general commercial litigation what do you focus on my practice encompasses a broad range of complex criminal and civil matters i provide guidance to individual and institutional clients at all stages of state and federal government investigations prosecutions and enforcement actions i help businesses mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution by designing and implementing strategies to prevent—and if necessary detect and remedy—wrongdoing by employees among other things i have represented a major technology company faced with a korean government investigation into alleged theft of trade secrets a major financial services firm targeted in a civil investigation into alleged fair lending violations by the illinois attorney general’s office a large manufacturer of highway safety products in a federal investigation into allegations of false claims to the federal highway administration and a large professional services firm subpoenaed by the massachusetts attorney general’s office in a public corruption investigation on the civil side i represent both plaintiffs and defendants in a number of commercial litigation matters i have extensive experience defending against putative class actions and previously represented a major national bank in a multidistrict federal litigation comprised of over  different consolidated class actions in another vigorously defended intellectual property action i helped a large manufacturer obtain a multimillion dollar settlement from a competitor what do you see on the horizon state governments are under more financial pressure now than ever before in pursuit of alternative streams of revenue state attorneys general and regulatory agencies will aggressively pursue criminal and civil enforcement actions that carry the risk of large fines and financial penalties at the federal level we will continue to see prosecutors apply close scrutiny to companies operating in the highly regulated fields of health care pharmaceuticals and financial services and they will increasingly employ an array of civil enforcement mechanisms as well in this environment it is crucial for businesses to retain experienced counsel to assist them in swiftly

death of the junk bond market as we know itmar   about peabody energy btu mark gottlieb value bonds activist investor contrarianmark gottiebsummaryi originally thought this was the story about peabody energy leading up to the confirmation hearing of its reorganization on the more i think about it i see it is about the future of junk bond market participationhow can you model recoveries of bonds in a bankruptcy scenario when recovery isnt based on reality and is determined by plan architects solely for their benefiti originally planned to write a piece on all the events leading up to the peabody energy btuuq reorganization hearing on  the more i think about it the more i realize the story is much more than a peabody energy story it is about the future existence of junk bond market participation sophisticated institutional and retail investors attempt to model recoveries of their bonds in a bankruptcy scenario how do you do that when the recovery is now primarily determined by plan architecture negotiated confidentially favoring plan proponents bearing almost no reflection of asset and balance sheet figures which models are customarily based upon this is what happened with peabody energy doesnt this totally destroy the junk bond markets as they currently exist proponents cant own all the bonds of every single distressed company the wider investor community is needed for the market to function effectively this would be the first time holders of identical securities get different recovery in us bankruptcy law history i challenge any readers of this to cite a similar example peabody energy is the worlds largest privatesector coal company here is the peabody energy story leading up to the march th confirmation hearing peabody energy filed chapter  in  peabody energy rode the wave to higher profits in late  as coal prices soared and donald trump who is procoal was elected president peabody energy subordinated debt reached  in  peabody energy filed a reorganization plan in late  which benefited the senior management team and the coproponents at the expense of everyone else coproponents are led by billionaire paul singer of elliott management peabody energy could have easily avoided chapter  fred palmer is a former peabody energy executive who explained why peabodys debt could have been reinstated and shareholders didnt need to be wiped out an australian investor spoke about peabodys management rebuffing prized asset sales in australia bankruptcy judge schermer denied an equity committee the court was presented with an alternative plan that was fair and equitable to all the judge is currently only giving consideration to the reorganization plan not the alternative plan wyco researcher wrote an excellent analysis on the alternative plan in this article of his restructuring advisory firm expert mark hootnick showed in court just how unfair the current plan is to non coproponents see exhibit c coproponents initial parties are  of unsecured creditor claims and per debtor plan would get  of new equity nonparticipants retail are  of unsecured creditor claims and per debtor plan would get  of new equity the bankruptcy judge approved not only the disclosure statement but also other motions including private placement agreement backstop agreement plan support agreement rights offering and the breakup fees this approval was despite strong objections from various stakeholders the plan includes a voting and rights offering portion and was purposely very confusing to limit participation from retail investors in my opinion wyco researcher weighed in on this terrible news for peabody investors here is a link below to a letter from a joel packer and his hearing in an attempt to form a committee of retail noteholders it was denied and he is appealing there is major discrimination going on in this situation with the funds led by elliott management discovery capital management and aurelius capital management getting phase  parties  of principal amount of  vs nonpsa parties  for the identical bond if their peabody energy reorg plan is approved it is my understanding if this plan is approved by the bankruptcy court it will be a first for approval of a reorg plan with this discrimination i can see retail investors getting a recovery of  on the dollar while the funds get  to  for the exact bond just in a different class the funds created the funds stand to earn billions which would be coming from often devastating losses of tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars on the exact same bond the  to  also takes into account the funds unlike retail investors would get to buy more shares at highly discounted prices and purposely low valuations which retail investors cannot when peabody previously had level ebitda b like today enterprise value was b   compared to the plan proponents negotiated plan enterprise value of b the bonds would be near par had they not filed chapter  which could have been avoided retail bids on peabody energy unsecured bonds collapsed  two weeks ago at fidelity  there was a bid of  cents a week ago on both the  and s  there were two identical bids for both   cents and  cents cover meanwhile also a week ago a phase  institutional trade went across at  cents i contacted the sec about irregular trading in peabody energy bonds and other matters but it fell on deaf ears this document was an attempt at discovery in the peabody energy trial the hedge funds and debtors were trying to black box the entire process and succeeded it sets a really bad precedent  allows all sorts of fraud to happen in this and future cases hear the outcome in court the coproponents are doing all they can to limit participation in the rights offering on their plan they can get the shares that others cant get at a deep discount that is the obvious intent of everything which limited participation including a short day christmas deadline for the psa agreement thus far judge schermer the judge in the peabody energy case has denied an equity committee approved the disclosure statement denied a retail noteholder committee and denied discovery requests bondholders received very confusing solicitation packages with terms that only benefit the funds hopefully if the retail class votes it down retail noteholders will get to vote on a nondiscriminatory alternative march  is the confirmation hearing day of the reorganization plan if the judge confirms the plan which was written by the debtors for their benefit and the benefit of the peabody energy senior management team at the expense of everyone else i believe this will mark the first time in history the us court would approve a discriminatory reorganization plan whereby holders of identical securities get different recoveries this either will be a day of justice in the court or a sad precedent for the future direction of the us court system i own  face value of peabody energy
