the fund tries to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity securities under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its assets in equity securities of mid cap companies equity securities include common stock preferred stock securities convertible into common stock or securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value of common stock mid cap companies are companies that at the time of purchase have market capitalizations in the range of companies included in the standard  poor’s sp midcap  value index generally between  billion and  billion as of march   this definition of midcapitalization companies may be changed in response to changes in the market the fund purchases securities that fund management believes have long term potential to grow in size or become more profitable or that the stock market may value more highly in the future fund management places particular emphasis on stocks trading at the low end of one or more valuation measures such as pricebook value or pricesales priceearnings or pricecash flow ratios such companies also may have particular qualities that affect the outlook for such companies including an attractive market niche the fund purchases primarily common stock of us companies in trying to meet its investment objective the fund may also invest up to  of its total assets in the securities of foreign companies the fund may invest in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principal risks of investing in the fund risk is inherent in all investing the value of your investment in the fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time you may lose part or all of your investment in the fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments the following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the fund ■ equity securities risk — stock markets are volatile the price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company’s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions ■ foreign securities risk — foreign investments often involve special risks not present in us investments that can increase the chances that the fund will lose money these risks include  ■ the fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight ■ changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the fund’s portfolio ■ the economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the united states with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product reinvestment of capital resources and balance of payments position ■ the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries ■ many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the united states and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to us securities laws ■ settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of us investments ■ investment style risk — under certain market conditions value investments have performed better during periods of economic recovery therefore this investment style may over time go in and out of favor at times when the investment style used by the fund is out of favor the fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles ■ market risk and selection risk — market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the fund invests will go down in value including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by fund management will underperform the markets the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies this means you may lose money ■ mid cap securities risk — the securities of mid cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization

financial data services inc  deer lake drive east jacksonville fl    dear shareholder we are pleased to provide you with this semiannual report for merrill lynch asset builder program inc the program consists of five separate diversified portfolios each with its own investment objectives complete performance information including average annual total returns for all five portfolios can be found on pages  of this report to shareholders fundamental value portfolio the quarter ended july   proved to be an exceptional one for the us equity market with share prices rebounding sharply from the april downdraft driving the market higher were continued favorable economic and corporate dynamics as well as strong mutual fund cash inflows the unmanaged standard  poors  sp  index registered a  total return during the three months ended july   exceeding fundamental value portfolios total returns of    and  for class a class b class c and class d shares respectively results shown do not reflect sales charges and would be lower if sales charges were included the underperformance of the portfolio reflects in part the generally lagging returns of low priceearnings issues the relative performance of these equities has been hindered by the indexing phenomenon which tends to favor largecapitalization growth companies we believe that the valuation disparities arising from this trend created opportunities in many basic value issues some of these opportunities have just begun to be realized as the markets leadership has shown signs of broadening examining the portfolios results for the period ended july   reveals the favorable influence of holdings in the technology and basic industry sectors and the adverse impact of positions in the telecommunications auto and media areas technology issues benefited from solid earnings gains and basic industry equities were boosted by improved fundamentals telecommunications companies continue to be plagued by ramifications of the telecommunications act of  auto issues were hindered by cyclical concerns and media companies were hampered by lackluster results leading individual gainers for the portfolio in the july period included tandem computers inc the subject of a takeover whx corp which rebounded on news of a strike settlement and scitex corp ltd whose fundamentals began to show marked improvement reflecting the heightened market volatility portfolio activity was particularly heavy in the period ended july   we initiated five positions eliminated  incremented  of current holdings and reduced  cash and cash equivalents increased to  of net assets at july   from  at april   during the july period we invested in outoffavor issues in the insurance multiindustry refining and marketing and technology sectors tig holdings inc a property and casualty insurer was purchased on weakness related to disappointing earnings results and a feared reserve deficiency we judged that the adversities were adequately reflected in the shares valuation with tig trading at a very reasonable  times book value per share and at  times  estimated earnings per share tigs nearterm premium growth is expected to be modest as the company transitions its business to specialty lines longer term we believe the company is favorably positioned for generating attractive returns bolstering our confidence in the shares is the heavy management ownership as well as the continued sizable share buybacks tenneco inc underwent significant restructuring over the last several years and is now favorably positioned in two product areas auto parts and specialty packaging we believe the shares offer attractive appreciation potential driven by solid market positions turnaround potential in the packaging business an economic value addeddriven eva management team and continued share buybacks tenneco was reasonably valued at  times  estimated earnings per share and provided a dividend yield of  sun company inc one of the largest independent refining and marketing companies in the united states was a lackluster performer for many years we judged the companys fortunes were about to change under the direction of a new president the first corporate outsider chosen for this position in suns year history the new leader has announced restructuring initiatives including refinery reconfigurations and cost reduction programs that have already yielded tangible operating results the shares were available at a modest  times  estimated earnings per share and provided an aboveaverage dividend yield of  novell inc a provider of network operating systems and services was a stock market laggard for several years the companys shares peaked in  at  and declined to a low near  in june  reflecting the severe competitive pressures inflicted by microsoft corp as well as several very untimely acquisitions made by former management we believe novell offers an attractive turnaround potential driven by new leadership a refocused strategy and exciting new products the new chief executive officer is transitioning the company from being a network operating system vendor where competition is intense to being a diversified provider of network services where there is no clear leader novells balance sheet is solid with cash and shortterm investments of  per share and no longterm debt digital equipment corp represents an attractive turnaround candidate in our view the shares have dramatically underperformed the market for some time languishing  below their early  high of  per share the underperformance reflects lackluster operating results resulting from a weak personal computer business losses in semiconductors and a misaligned sales structure these problems have been largely rectified and we believe the company is poised for improved operating results indeed management has laid out an intermediateterm net margin goal of  implying an earnings potential of  per share in several years a marked improvement from the depressed  per share reported in the fiscal year ended june   the shares were purchased at a modest  of sales per share and at a reasonable  times  estimated earnings per share completed sales in the july period included three issues that were the subjects of takeoversmergers total petroleum ltd transitional hospitals corp and greater new york savings bank a partial sale tandem computers inc was also the subject of a takeover other positions eliminated included two technology holdings that had reached our price targets national semiconductor corp and com corp issues whose turnaround potentials had diminished and thus were eliminated included computervision corp evans withycombe residential inc and national auto credit inc though the overall us stock market is trading at record valuation levels we continue to find attractive candidates for inclusion in the fundamental value portfolio our strict valuation discipline results in the portfolio having a reasonable valuation the average priceearnings ratio of the portfolios equity investments is two thirds of the sp s multiple and the pricebook ratio is less than onehalf that of the market benchmark global opportunity portfolio as of july   the asset allocation for global opportunity portfolio was foreign stocks  of net assets us stocks  foreign bonds  us bonds  and cash reserves of  during the three months ended july   the total returns of global opportunity portfolios class a class b class c and class d shares were    and  respectively results shown do not reflect sales charges and would be lower if sales charges were included during the period ended july   we became more positive toward us bonds and increased the weighting from  of net assets as of april   to  as of july   the duration of the us fixedincome sector was also increased from  years to  years our more optimistic stance toward us bonds reflected evidence of a slowdown in the us economys growth rate and indications that inflationary pressures were exceptionally subdued at the same time the rapid shrinkage of the federal budget deficit reduced the supply of newly issued us government securities relative to the demand overall we expected a decline in intermediate and longterm interest rates to continue resulting in a favorable rewardrisk relationship for us bonds going forward to expand the us bond commitment we primarily used proceeds from sales of foreign bonds we reduced foreign bond holdings from  to  of net assets during the july period by eliminating positions in australian french and finnish bonds and reducing the commitment to german obligations at the same time our belief that the total return potential of uk obligations was attractive led us to establish a position in sterlingdenominated bonds as a result european bonds continue to account for the major portion of assets in the foreign bond sector we maintained a position in canada as a means of obtaining indirect exposure to us interest rates our expectation of further us dollar strength resulted in our hedging the european bonds and stock positions except for uk holdings the japanese equity holdings and the position in australian common stock back to the us dollar foreign equity allocation did not materially change during the july period japan remained the largest single commitment although the weighting remains below the benchmark morgan stanley europe australia far east index while we sold the position in eisai co ltd in japan we established commitments in matsushita electric works ltd and amway japan ltd we continue to maintain a meaningful position in canada and latin america with a new position established in uniao de bancos brasileiros sa unibanco in europe changes included the sale of british steel plc and the establishment of commitments in gucci group nv orionyhtyma oy and perstorp ab we also reduced our already limited representation in asia by accepting profits in hong kong telecommunications ltd in the us equity sector the largest concentration of assets remained in the financial services category which is a beneficiary of declining us interest rates we also maintained meaningful positions in healthcare technology and energy these areas of emphasis are unchanged over the past three months and reflect our expectation that earnings of selected companies in these sectors should continue to exceed consensus expectations despite a slower rate of us economic growth growth opportunity portfolio during the quarter ended july   the total returns of growth opportunity portfolios class a class b class c and class d shares were    and  respectively the portfolio outperformed the lipper growth funds average total returns of  and the  return of the unmanaged sp  results shown do not reflect sales charges and would be lower if sales charges were included the most important contributors to the portfolios positive absolute and relative returns were the significant weightings in the communications equipment industry  of july quarterend net assets computer software  oil services  and the computer industry  individual companies contributing significantly to the positive returns were cisco systems inc lucent technologies inc schlumberger ltd and compaq computers corp all of which were among the top ten equity holdings investment activities during the july period focused on increasing the equity weightings in the communications equipment computer software and oil service industries we reduced the pharmaceutical industry weighting because of our concerns about a nearterm decline in valuation ratios as the rate of earnings growth moderates corporate reports of capital spending intentions during the period ended july   reflected the possibility of a continued increase in the rate of investment spending on network computer systems advanced digital wired and wireless communication infrastructure and energy exploration activities although the overall rate of growth in corporate earnings reported for the july period was at a slower pace than the yeartoyear gains in the first quarter of  the rate of growth appears sufficient to sustain the capital spending pace in the communications equipment computers computer software and oil services industries the ten largest industry sectors in the portfolio at july   were communications equipment computer software pharmaceuticals oil services banking and financial computers financial services electrical equipment medical technology and cosmetics these industries represented  of net assets on july   the top ten equity holdings were equal to  of net assets we added four companies to the portfolio during the period ended july   they included citicorp bankamerica corp cvs corporation and american express company citicorp the worlds leading multinational financial services and banking organization was added because of the attractive valuation relative to expectations of aboveaverage growth in earnings and rates of return with relative consistency citicorp has a broad base of business in the emerging markets of asia latin america and eastern europe as well as the developed world we added bankamerica corp because of the attractive valuation relative to expectations of aboveaverage growth rates in earnings from internal restructuring of operations cvs corporation one of the major pharmaceutical retailers was added to the portfolio because of the attractive valuation relative to the expectations of aboveaverage rates of growth in earnings american express company was added because of the attractive valuation relative to expectations of aboveaverage rates of growth in earnings from asset management as well as travelrelated business services we eliminated wells fargo  co from the portfolio because we viewed the stock as overvalued relative to our perspective on the fundamentals of the organization we continued to be relatively fully invested during the july period with cash and cash equivalents at july   equal to  of net assets we continued to have a positive outlook for investment in the us equity markets quality bond portfolio at the beginning of the year federal reserve board frb chairman alan greenspan cautioned investors about a possible preemptive strike against inflation while there were few signs of accelerating inflation in the thencurrent data he warned that monetary policy acts with a lag and that it would be easier to tighten policy at that time as a precaution rather than tighten later and more sharply once inflation was evident the frb followed through with chairman greenspans warning and tightened policy on march   since the march tightening economic data have been more benign including bullish inflation reports from the employment cost index and producer price index the yield on the longterm treasury bond peaked at  in midapril then began to drop this rally was fueled by a significant change in investor expectations regarding the economy and the outlook for interest rates in early may there was widespread agreement that the frb was ready for another tightening of monetary policy and it was generally assumed that a further tightening would be needed by july however the consumer price index cpi rose only  for the first five months of  compared with a  increase over the same period in  at the same time retail sales figures continued to decline as a result the may increase in interest rates did not occur and the bond market continued to gain momentum increasing evidence of noninflationary economic growth boosted investor confidence which was confirmed further at the beginning of july when as widely expected the frb chose to leave monetary policy unchanged this confluence of positive indicators helped produce a significant rally in the us securities market we participated in the bond rally by extending the average maturity of the quality bond portfolio to  years investments favored the financial services sector which stands to benefit from the low inflation environment the average credit quality of the portfolios holdings is aa as measured by standard  poors corp ratings cash was invested in shortterm instruments to take advantage of the favorable spread us government securities portfolio on july   frb chairman alan greenspan delivered his humphrey hawkins testimony which was the most positive assessment of the us economy he has ever delivered the speech appears to have erased the prospect of any nearterm rise in interest rates and frb policy will likely remain on hold for the foreseeable future the fundamentals and technicals continue to impress investors pushing both the bond and equity markets to new heights the dow jones industrial average soared past  this past quarter and the long term us treasury bond yield broke  since the last frb interest rate increase in march the economy though still growing has slowed and inflation has been tame in fact the producer price index ppi cpi and the employment cost index eci have been subdued for so long it appears that investors are no longer fearful of increases as they were in the past many economists theorized a new reality economic environment one in which economic growth can be achieved without increased inflation the frb was tolerant of sustained economic growth because it was accompanied by low inflation the ppi released in july marked its sixth consecutive monthly decline and the cpi released in july rose a modest  keeping inflation at a year low this put the inflation rate for the first six months of  at the lowest level in  years the eci is something that the frb watches closely and it continues to run at under  in order for the frb to warrant a tightening of monetary policy we believe they will need to see some mixture of abovepotential economic growth and evidence of inflation as of july   the year treasury note yield a benchmark for mortgagebacked securities mbs stood at  this yield is  basis points lower for the onemonth period  basis points lower for the threemonth period and  basis points lower for the sixmonth period as typically happens in months where interest rates drop dramatically in a very short period of time mbs yields spreads widened versus their treasury counterparts in july when interest rates decrease refinancing opportunities increase and mbs prices tend to compress as prepayment fears get priced into their yields the us government securities portfolio was somewhat immune to the widening spreads as we avoided those mbs which are the most susceptible to prepaying and suffered the most widening of the portfolios  mbs allocation  is invested in low coupon mbs whose homeowners have no incentive to refinance the remaining  of mbs is invested in superpremium mbs whose homeowners have already gone through several refinancing opportunities the portfolio also has  of net assets invested in us treasury notes and strips and a  cash position during the july period we extended the duration of the us treasury notes allocation in the portfolio this benefited performance as longterm treasury securities had the strongest performance as yields came down and the us treasury curve flattened we also lowered the average coupon of the mbs allocation in the portfolio and kept duration neutral in this sector with the purchase of year balloon mbs and additional year mbs although mbs underperformed their treasury counterparts in july they still offer a very attractive yield advantage this factor coupled with low longterm implied volatility should keep mbs a very attractive fixedincome investment in conclusion we thank you for your investment in merrill lynch asset builder program inc and we
