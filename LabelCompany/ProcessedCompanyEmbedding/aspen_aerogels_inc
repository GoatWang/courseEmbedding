aerogels planned statesboro ga manufacturing plant joint development agreement for next generation aerogel products to accelerate market expansion ludwigshafen germany and northborough mass june   prnewswire  basf se basf and aspen aerogels inc aspen nyse aspn announced today the expansion of their strategic partnership with the signing of an exclusive supply agreement and a joint development agreement the agreements are designed to increase market penetration enhance product profitability and facilitate the development of next generation materials as part of the supply agreement aspen will commit to the exclusive supply of its spaceloft® a product for incorporation within basfs aerogel enhanced slentex® wall system for the building materials market in turn basf will make a low doubledigit million investment in the construction of aspens new manufacturing plant and basf will become a base load customer for aspens capacity expansion in addition basf will provide technical support to aspen targeting manufacturing productivity product cost and profit margins initially the supply agreement will support basfs efforts to drive growth in the global building materials market of its slentex® wall system incorporating aspens patented technology basf may also directly sell or incorporate spaceloft® a into other systems for applications in certain building transportation consumer and industrial markets worldwide the agreement will run through  we chose to partner with aspen because of their superior aerogel technology platform which we can enhance as partners in various ways said raimar jahn president of basfs performance materials division the new agreements will accelerate adoption of aerogel technology as an ecoefficient insulation material globally the joint development agreement establishes a framework to develop new aerogel products and technologies the agreement will give basf targeted access to aspens world leading technology platform while aspen will gain access to basfs technical expertise sales channels and financial resources the partnership will both further aspens market diversification and growth strategy and support basfs
