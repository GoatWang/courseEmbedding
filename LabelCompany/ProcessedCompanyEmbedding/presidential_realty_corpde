major builder of public housing projects after world war ii and then as a developer of thousands of apartment units ownership and operation of rental housing became the prime activity of the firm in the ’s presidential had its ipo in  and was listed on the american stock exchange by  presidential owned property in twelve states and puerto rico and had total assets in excess of  million over its history the company had interests in over  apartments units in addition to ownership interests in office buildings industrial properties and shopping centers the companys class a and class b common stock currently trade in the overthecounter market under the symbols pdnla and pdnlb respectively presidential overview in november of  a new management team took over the operations of presidential reit and made a strategic investment in the company  the new team was led by nickolas jekogian ceo of signature group investments  the team set in place a strategic plan to reduce operating costs and to implement a growth strategy that focuses on the acquisition and upreit of high dividend yielding assets across the country  national expansion plan presidential realty corporation a publicly traded real estate investment trust is working to develop a portfolio of high dividend yielding assets across the nation we are looking for real estate private equity funds and owneroperators that would be interested in discussing their holdings and the potential merits of contributing them into the reit in exchange for shares in an upreit structure we are seeking partnerships with reputable operators to grow our portfolio throughout the united states for acquisitions please email acquisitionspresrealtycom upreit overview umbrella partnership real estate investment trusts “upreit” are the primary vehicle for an owner of real property to convert ownership of one or more specific properties into an interest which can be converted into a publiclytraded security in the basic upreit structure properties are acquired and owned directly or indirectly by the umbrella partnership the umbrella partnership is the entity through which the reit operates and collects all income from the properties the reit does not directly own any real estate properties in the upreit structure‚ rather it owns interests in the operating partnership by being both its sole general partner and one of its limited partners in an upreit transaction‚ property owners contribute their properties in exchange for ownership units in the operating partnership “op units” conversion from op units to reit shares is considered a taxable event‚ so the investor may choose to convert over time‚ which enables the investor to incur any tax liability in smaller increments upreit structure upreit benefits taxes the owner does not recognize immediate gain on the transaction because the owner does not acquire publiclytraded stock in the reit but rather receives units in the operating partnership “op units” if the op units received from the operating partnership end up in the owners estate the ultimate recipients of the units will receive a stepped up basis equal to the value at death or the alternate valuation date and the inherent gain resulting from the upreit transaction will not be subject to capital gains or income tax the tax deferral or avoidance as the case may be gives upreits a large advantage over cash purchasers this is particularly true for individuals or entities which have a low tax basis and therefore the potential gain is substantial diversification a transaction can be structured which enables the property owner to convert an interest in one or more specific properties into an interest in a larger and more balanced portfolio of properties held by the upreit the portfolio is often diversified as to property type and geography and usually benefits from the economies of scale and management that a larger entity can offer liquidity the upreit structure allows an interest in illiquid individual properties to become more easily saleable stock appreciation there is the potential for the stock in the reit to appreciate beyond the value of the owners’ real estate contribution this could potentially deliver higher returns than those achievable from the ownership of one or more specific properties   presidential realty corporation announces the settlement of all claims
