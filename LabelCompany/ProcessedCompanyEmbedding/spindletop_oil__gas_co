texas for a long time native americans thought drinking oil would cure digestive problems in  spanish explorers used oil to waterproof their bootscitation needed there had long been suspicions that oil might be under spindletop hill the area was known for its vast sulfur springs and bubbling gas seepages that would ignite if lit in august  george w obrien george w carroll pattillo higgins and others formed the gladys city oil gas and manufacturing company to do exploratory drilling on spindletop hill the company drilled many dry holes and ran into trouble as investors began to balk at pouring more money into drilling with no oil to show for itcitation needed pattillo higgins left the company and teamed with captain anthony f lucas the leading expert in the us on salt dome formations lucas made a lease agreement in  with the gladys city company and a subsequent agreement with higgins lucas drilled to  feet  m before running out of money he secured additional funding from john h galey and james m guffey of pittsburgh but the deal left lucas with only an eighth share of the lease and higgins with nothing lucas continued drilling and on january   at a depth of  ft  m what is known as the lucas gusher or the lucas geyser blew oil over  feet  m in the air at a rate of  barrels per day  md gallons it took nine days before the well was brought under control spindletop was the largest gusher the world had seen and catapulted beaumont into an oilfueled boomtown beaumonts population of  tripled in three months and eventually rose to  speculation led land

populist sentiment against standard oil was particularly strong at the time of the spindletop discovery in  an oil products marketing company affiliated with standard oil had been banned from the state for its cutthroat business practices although standard built refineries in the area standard was unable to dominate the new gulf coast oil fields the way it had in the eastern states as a result a number of startup oil companies at spindletop such as texaco and gulf oil grew into formidable competitors to standard oil among those drilling at spindletop was w scott heywood a native of cleveland ohio who in  made the first oil discovery in nearby jeff davis parish in southwestern louisiana in  heywood was elected to a single term in the louisiana state senate production at spindletop began to decline rapidly after  and the wells produced only  barrels per day  md by  on november   the yountlee oil company brought in its mcfaddin no  at a depth of about  feet  m sparking a second boom which culminated in the fields peak production year of  during which  million barrels  gl were produced over the ten years following the mcfaddin discovery more than  million barrels  gl
