analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information and financial data discussed below is derived from our unaudited financial statements herein for the period from inception august   through march   the unaudited financial statements were prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the information and financial data discussed below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the related notes contained elsewhere in this prospectus the financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus fully represent our financial condition and operations however they are not indicative of our future performance overview we were incorporated under the laws of the state of florida on august   optileaf inc was formed to provide a worldclass fully integrated turnkey growth management system for the cannabis industry to help dispensary owners grow operations and caregivers increase their sales and reduce costs increase their companys productivity and profitability and reduce or eliminate the need for manual labor while maximizing yield we are presently a development stage company with no customers sales suppliers or inventory as of this filing optileafs target market includes dispensaries and grow operations optileaf has completed the development of its grow pro and pos management software both products are being beta tested in the state of colorado and we are currently looking for beta testers in the states of washington and oregon optileaf has completed integration with metric in the state of colorado and oregon and with biotrack in the state of washington optileaf plans on commencing the development of its wireless network censors in the latter half of  we believe our integrated hardware will be capable of monitoring and adjusting light soil moisture co temperature ventilation nutrients and humidity as needed in real time and aroundtheclock our product once developed the heart of our system will be the innovative multipurpose growth management software suite optileaf plans to add proprietary hardware components which we believe together with software will provide a turnkey growth management system the system once developed and implemented will potentially allow growers to realize significant labor savings as common grow house tasks are fully automated once developed we believe our integrated hardware is capable of monitoring and adjusting light soil moisture co temperature ventilation nutrients and humidity as needed in real time and aroundtheclock once developed we believe our user interface data tracking and remote access capabilities could potentially allow growers to monitor adjust and manage their facilities as needed from anywhere in the world however none of our products are fully developed or available for sale or use at this time and there can be no assurance that our products will ever become fully developed or will gain market acceptance when and if fully developed in the period from inception august   through march   we had approximately  of other income and our net loss was approximately  as of march   we had total current assets of approximately  and total current liabilities of approximately  our strategy optileaf will offer a complete line of hardware and software technological solution for the cannabis industry our software is a seedtosale growth management system designed to not only offer a complete grow automation system but to enhance every aspect of the medical cannabis business our wireless sensor networks will include an array of products that control monitor and automate all aspects of the grow house operations our principal product optileaf growpro elite provides a complete robust stateoftheart hardware and software solution for large cultivation operations with multiple locations the heart of our system will be a multipurpose growth management software suite optileaf will add proprietary hardware components which together with software will provide a turnkey growth management system the system will potentially allow growers to realize significant labor savings as common grow house tasks are fully automated our integrated hardware is capable of monitoring and adjusting light soil moisture co temperature ventilation nutrients and humidity as needed in real time and aroundtheclock our user interface data tracking and remote access capabilities allow growers to monitor adjust and manage their facilities as needed from anywhere in the world our products will be manufactured in the usa and asia managed by a team possessing years of experience with domestic and overseas production optileaf does not directly distribute sell grow harvest cannabis or any substances that violate united states law or the controlled substances act nor does it intend to do so in the future while individual components of our system are available from our main competitors optileaf believes it will have the first and only system to completely integrate all aspects of growth automation and management into one system marketing optileaf will focus its sales and marketing efforts in the states of colorado oregon and washington at this point once the rules and regulations for the state of california are introduced we plan to expand our marketing efforts into that state as well we have decided to focus our efforts with the most developed and broadest customer base at this point we are currently in the process of interviewing and hiring for full time marketing and sales personnel in colorado oregon and washington there are a total of  potential customers in the states of colorado oregon and washington operations optileafs operational strategies behind the development of our products and services are based on design innovation and added value when developing a new product we want to be the leader by introducing innovative features that will allow cannabis cultivators to lower their costs boost yields and maximize production capacity furthermore when optileaf develops new goods or services we will package them with support services as well as immediate observable and psychological benefits our focus is on how our products and services stand against the competition and how our technical measures relate to the customers needs over the next twelve months we anticipate expenses of up to  including general administrative and corporate expenses the extent of such expenses will depend upon the successful implementation of our financing strategy and the acceleration of our business plan accordingly we expect to finance our operations primarily through our existing cash our operations and any future financing if we do not obtain additional funding we will continue to operate on a reduced budget until such time as more capital is raised we believe that we could operate with our current cash on hand while satisfying any shortfall in cash flow with income that will be generated after the launch of our sales and marketing programs however to effectively implement our business plan we will need to obtain additional financing in the future if we obtain financing we would expect to accelerate our business plan and increase our advertising and marketing budget hire additional staff members and increase our office space and operations all of which we believe would result in the generation of revenue and profit for our company results of operations we have conducted minimal operations during the period from inception august   to march   we generated other income of approximately  during this period we had net losses of approximately  for the period from inception august   to march   liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash of  our primary uses of cash were for employee compensation and working capital the main sources of cash were from our founders and private placement of securities the following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to long term  an increase in working capital requirements  addition of administrative and sales personnel as the business grows  increases in advertising public relations and sales promotions as we commence operations  research and development  the cost of being a public company and the continued increase in costs due to governmental compliance activities the following summarizes the key components of the companys cash flows for the three months ended march   and   may   c  cybernet
