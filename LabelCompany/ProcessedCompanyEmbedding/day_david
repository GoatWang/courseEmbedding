tearyeyed when people win sports championships or awards even some songs and television commercials make me cry and so while it shouldnt come as a complete surprise to me david nicholls terrific book one day made me sob i mean i came completely unhinged egadsemma morley and dexter mayhew connect at a party the night they graduate from college in edinburgh dexter is goodlooking popular and privileged fairly unaware of the world around him except where it directly affects him emma of middle class origins considers herself to be a bit nonconformist although she has had a bit of a crush on dexter throughout college they nearly sleep together but spend about a day and a half in each others company and this sets in motion a connection that spans nearly  years one day follows the peaks and valleys of dexter and emmas relationship on the same dayjuly each year sometimes theyre close friends sometimes theyre not sometimes one is romantically involved while the other isnt sometimes one experiences career success while the other struggles one of the characters refers to emma and dexter as harry and sally and there is definitely elements of that film relationship in theirs but the book is funny thoughtprovoking emotionally charged and even a little maudlin from time to time especially if youre a sapthis is a book about love in many formsfriendship romance sexual attraction marriage parentchild relationships unrequited crushes etc as emma says at one point love and be loved if you ever get the chance the book may be a bit predictable at times and sometimes the characters arent completely likeable but i found this tremendously compelling and gripping it has been optioned into a movie and as much as i hate most film adaptations of books i love i will definitely need to see this one because much as its main characters felt about each other this book has gotten hold of my heart if youre a romanticor just a sap like meread this book read more top critical reviewsee all  critical reviews›  people found this helpful  out of  starsa tale of longing  loneliness cleverly disguised as a story of love  friendship not at all what i expectedbynicole don april  last year i got hooked on listening to audiobooks during my commute so ive been trolling amazon for reading material ever since i had remembered seeing the trailer for one day when it came out a few years back as a movie starring anne hathaway i recalled that it looked sweet and that i wanted to see it at the time i never did needless to say or i probably wouldnt have bought the audiobookanyway this was not at all what i expected the format is pretty unique the author david nicholls gives you a snapshot of the two lead characters  dexter mayhew and emma morley  on a single day each year for about a year period its interesting to see where they are in life  with each other other friends family careers other relationships etc i was very quickly drawn to the unconventional but very sweet bond that em  dex seemed to have with one another i think this was one thing that really had me hooked early oni actually quite liked the audiobook for the first several discs i listened to its something like  hours in total for the unabridged version nicholls does a great job giving the characters wit charm and personality i was very quickly hooked on the story and practically looked for excuses to run to the store or go out to pick up dinner so i could listen thats kind of pathetic i know i was not quite halfway done with the audiobook when i decided i couldnt wait to spend  more hours in the car before knowing what happened so i decided to rent the movie to watch on a lazy weekend day this was both a terrible mistake and a great idea on one hand i was quite impressed at how closely the movie stayed with the book that rarely happens but there were only two small parts that i noticed that had changed only slightly and i mean these were very minor parts of course the movie had to cut out about  of the book which really diluted the quality but overall it was a pretty close depiction of what nicholls put on paper i was not expecting what happens toward the last couple sections of the book i was glad that i watched the movie because i may have actually wrecked my car if id heard that unexpectedly while driving watching the movie also made me hate the story in a way because it was not what i wanted or what i expected for these characters i almost didnt finish the audiobook because i didnt want to waste my time building up to a conclusion that i hated but i did it was just as depressing and upsetting as i had expected but i was prepared for it so that was good i supposeall in all this is a book that i expected to be a sweet tale of friendship love and relationships and on the surface for the first  or so of the book it seems to be just this but given that the author is showing you a glimpse of their lives for one day a year for such a long period of time when you think of it it really is a depressing tale of longing loneliness and possibly a life wasted not going after what you truly want i prefer either horrible crime  mystery books or romantic love stories i dont like when the two intermix im not one to prefer a surprise ending to a book like this but maybe thats just me david nicholls if youre reading this youre an extremely talented writer but dont ever do that to me again to sum everything up dont bother with the movie because its depressing leaves out way too much and it will probably leave you angry like it did me if you like a sweet story and dont mind some unexpected twists and turns then youll probably really like this book if you happen to do audiobooks the narrator for this one is fantastic she speaks with an english accent which was a little distracting for me at first only because im not used to hearing the accent but after the first  minutes or so all my thoughts were suddenly floating around my head with a charming little accent and i was basically expecting everyone around me to sound like kate middleton when they spoke so dont let that bother you i give the narrator huge props though she does an amazing and seamless job swapping between all the different characters and somehow her male voices dont sound like a girl trying to speak in a mans voice they are very natural which made for an amazing audiobook experiencei just finished this yesterday so i still dont know how i feel about it i hated some of the things that happened and was not pleased at all with the ending but i was very delighted and entertained at many parts throughout so if youre an avid reader and havent picked this one up maybe go for it if you prefer something more predictable and upbeat ie without any depressing undertones skip it read

loneliness cleverly disguised as a story of love  friendship not at all what i expectedbynicole don april  format audible audio editionverified purchaselast year i got hooked on listening to audiobooks during my commute so ive been trolling amazon for reading material ever since i had remembered seeing the trailer for one day when it came out a few years back as a movie starring anne hathaway i recalled that it looked sweet and that i wanted to see it at the time i never did needless to say or i probably wouldnt have bought the audiobookanyway this was not at all what i expected the format is pretty unique the author david nicholls gives you a snapshot of the two lead characters  dexter mayhew and emma morley  on a single day each year for about a year period its interesting to see where they are in life  with each other other friends family careers other relationships etc i was very quickly drawn to the unconventional but very sweet bond that em  dex seemed to have with one another i think this was one thing that really had me hooked early oni actually quite liked the audiobook for the first several discs i listened to its something like  hours in total for the unabridged version nicholls does a great job giving the characters wit charm and personality i was very quickly hooked on the story and practically looked for excuses to run to the store or go out to pick up dinner so i could listen thats kind of pathetic i know i was not quite halfway done with the audiobook when i decided i couldnt wait to spend  more hours in the car before knowing what happened so i decided to rent the movie to watch on a lazy weekend day this was both a terrible mistake and a great idea on one hand i was quite impressed at how closely the movie stayed with the book that rarely happens but there were only two small parts that i noticed that had changed only slightly and i mean these were very minor parts of course the movie had to cut out about  of the book which really diluted the quality but overall it was a pretty close depiction of what nicholls put on paper i was not expecting what happens toward the last couple sections of the book i was glad that i watched the movie because i may have actually wrecked my car if id heard that unexpectedly while driving watching the movie also made me hate the story in a way because it was not what i wanted or what i expected for these characters i almost didnt finish the audiobook because i didnt want to waste my time building up to a conclusion that i hated but i did it was just as depressing and upsetting as i had expected but i was prepared for it so that was good i supposeall in all this is a book that i expected to be a sweet tale of friendship love and relationships and on the surface for the first  or so of the book it seems to be just this but given that the author is showing you a glimpse of their lives for one day a year for such a long period of time when you think of it it really is a depressing tale of longing loneliness and possibly a life wasted not going after what you truly want i prefer either horrible crime  mystery books or romantic love stories i dont like when the two intermix im not one to prefer a surprise ending to a book like this but maybe thats just me david nicholls if youre reading this youre an extremely talented writer but dont ever do that to me again to sum everything up dont bother with the movie because its depressing leaves out way too much and it will probably leave you angry like it did me if you like a sweet story and dont mind some unexpected twists and turns then youll probably really like this book if you happen to do audiobooks the narrator for this one is fantastic she speaks with an english accent which was a little distracting for me at first only because im not used to hearing the accent but after the first  minutes or so all my thoughts were suddenly floating around my head with a charming little accent and i

still loved itbylarry hofferon august  format kindle editionverified purchasemy name is larry hoffer and i am an absolute sap seriously i get tearyeyed when people win sports championships or awards even some songs and television commercials make me cry and so while it shouldnt come as a complete surprise to me david nicholls terrific book one day made me sob i mean i came completely unhinged egadsemma morley and dexter mayhew connect at a party the night they graduate from college in edinburgh dexter is goodlooking popular and privileged fairly unaware of the world around him except where it directly affects him emma of middle class origins considers herself to be a bit nonconformist although she has had a bit of a crush on dexter throughout college they nearly sleep together but spend about a day and a half in each others company and this sets in motion a connection that spans nearly  years one day follows the peaks and valleys of dexter and emmas relationship on the same dayjuly each year sometimes theyre close friends sometimes theyre not sometimes one is romantically involved while the other isnt sometimes one experiences career success while the other struggles one of the characters refers to emma and dexter as harry and sally and there is definitely elements of that film relationship in theirs but the book is funny thoughtprovoking emotionally charged and even a little maudlin from time to time especially if youre a sapthis is a book about love in many formsfriendship romance sexual attraction marriage parentchild relationships unrequited crushes etc as emma says at one point love and be loved if you ever get the chance the book may be a bit predictable at times and sometimes the characters arent completely likeable but i found this tremendously compelling and gripping it has been optioned into a movie and as much as i hate most film adaptations of books i love i will definitely need to see this one because much as its main characters felt about each other this book has gotten hold of my heart if youre a romanticor just a sap like meread this bookcomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport

editionverified purchaseon july   emma morley and dexter mayhew spend the night together after their graduation from university their whole lives are ahead of them lives full of potential promise and hope each chapter captures a snapshot of their lives on that day st swithins day each year for twenty years unfortunately the significance of this day is completely lost on american readers according to the folklore as stated on wikipedia whatever the weather is on st swithins day will continue for the next forty days i suppose groundhogs day would be the american analogue its a day that symbolizes how life can swing in either direction  sunny or rainy spring or winterthe appeal of this novel is its fresh and unique format  revisiting two people on the same day each year over twenty years how would their lives change year to year how would the characters develop over time how would their relationship progress and more interestingly what kind of creative storytelling could the author accomplishaside from the format its surprisingly difficult to describe what this book is about ive read reviews that characterize it as a love story it is not ive read reviews that liken it to when harry met sally again it is not if you go into this book with such notions youll be sorely disappointed yes the novel has some romantic undertones but characterizing it as a love story will create certain expectations that may go unrealized its about two people who happen to be friends fumbling through their twenties and thirties the author is quite good at portraying the simultaneous feelings of earnest hopefulness and terrifying aimlessness that characterizes the experience of many young adults today neither emma nor dexter knows what to do with the blank canvases that they were given they dont seem to know what they want out of life whether that is on a professional level or on a personal levelnicholls gives us a great set up emma morley is a smart idealistic girl from a workingclass family who isnt afraid to boycott or protest for certain causes dexter mayhew is a privileged playboy who parties just a little too much through their friendship emma always brings out the best in dexter but im not quite sure what he does for her these initial character sketches are believable realistic and charming however as the novel progresses the characters especially dexter become tiresome as a novel that relies so heavily on two people it has no choice but to be a characterdriven book and unfortunately it is the character development that is lacking in this book to be fair emmas character undergoes a satisfactory transformation it is dexters character that is dreadful he is a goodlooking spoiled drunk with too much money on his hands i get it but then i got tired of it i kept waiting for dexter to hit rock bottom so that he could rise instead he just bounced around the bottom without ever redeeming himself many recent college graduates feel lost and without direction i get that but does it really take twenty years to get your act together and even then im not entirely convinced that dexter ever didthe novel is easy to read it doesnt take long to breeze through the chapters the pacing is steady at a brisk medium speed the author sometimes takes advantage of the format by building suspense about what might happen on the very next day july th only to jump ahead a full year in the following chapter this is fun also the dialogue between the two main characters is a pleasure to read their casual banter is playful and perfectly expresses their closeness familiarity and comfort with each other most of this book is funny and light while a few parts are serious and dark all in all its not a bad book it just could have been so much

paperbackverified purchasethis was such a wonderful book funny and meaningful and smart and emotional a characterdriven story about two people emma and dexter it focuses on their lives and relationship over a span of twenty years the format was really original  each chapter taking place on july th of a particular year  and i thought that worked really well and set the story apart from other contemporary romanceswhat i liked most about it was how real the characters and the story felt emma and dexter were flawed yet completely relatable dealing with what ever life threw at them sometimes with grace but most often by making mistakes and figuring things out the hard way just like the rest of us their relationship was realistic too far from perfect yet always something i was rooting for they are friends for most of the book and despite their differences worked well with each other that being said i do wish a little more time was spent on them when they were in a romantic relationship because that was what i was waiting for the majority of the bookthe writing was excellent very insightful perceptive and usually humorous the dialogue was also noteworthy some of the best ive ever readi dont like surprises so i read spoilers about the ending which i think helped me appreciate the book more the ending was realistic bittersweet and i thought it fit in well with the overall tone of the book and what nicholls was trying to get across all in all i definitely recommend this bookcommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the

comments right now please try again later out of  starsgood writer too into himselfbyodile boyeton may  format paperbackverified purchaseso heres the thing i only got a bit over  pages into this book and i had to quit david nicholls has a knack an incredible one for painting a scene in a book that you can really see there are a few passages that just punch you in the face with their accuracy that you know you are seeing the exact thing the writer intended you to see heres an example she had once studied fashion in london but these days ran a village antiques shop selling expensive rugs and chandeliers to genteel oxford with great success she still carried with her that aura of having been somethinginthesixtiesbut with no apparent sadness or regret she had given this up for a resolutely respectable secure comfortable family life perfect i get the complexity of this character and why her past immediately good writingheres the problem with nicholls he thinks hes good or at least he understands he has some knack for distilling and delivering and he loves to pat himself on the back and the way it comes off in the book is this selfcongratulatory overdone yuck worse the characters at least in the first third of the book hate themselves they are borderline suicidal i tell you and thats where he fails i think hes trying to catch teenage angst that never gets resolved and so evolves into twentysomething treading in bottomlessness but it comes off as this true selfloathing thats so hard to understand at least for the female character she was top of her class more or less and i get her anticapatilst penchant it makes sense why she gives up on her activism but why does that translate to enjoying the selffulfilling prophecy of picking a terrible fast food job and using it as proof that her dreams were always worthless and even if a natural course of failure why does she revel in punishing herselfever seen an actor get big and then she keeps winking at himherself in their great acting in the next piece you see them in thats this book and i promise im not an embittered reader who wants the magic of some past book to repeat itself because ive never read anything else from this authorplease do not torture yourself i want my  backgcomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products

love story which unfolds in england over the past twenty years it begins in the early morning hours of july   when two just graduated students  idealistic and overachieving emma morley and wealthy funloving dexter mayhew  who have met at a party and gone back to her flat spend a few hours chatting and then checks back in on the two characters each year on that date over the next twenty years before circling back to  to relate how the two spent the rest of that first day together the story is mostly about their friendship it’s beginning in the informal unstructured atmosphere of their college days continuing on through letters postcards phone calls and meetings at friends’ weddings until eventually they fall in love or realize that they fell in love the day that they met if you’re very romantic and get married the ‘one day’ narrative technique is a gimmick but it doesn’t come across that way instead it’s a perfectly effective vehicle for describing both their relationship and how the two grow up throughout their twenties and thirties even though each chapter is limited to describing only one day the important events in their lives which take place between the anniversary dates are discreetly filled in through subtle exposition the novel is particularly strong in its dialogue which runs the gamut from college friends chatting aimlessly about their future plans or lack thereof to first date talk to the awkward conversations people have with alcoholics also of interest to the anglophilic is all of the references to british culture like ‘underground zone ’ and the nostalgia for late twentieth century britain when it was known as cool britannia when dexter falls on hard times after having been a successful tv personality it is said that “even the guy who plays the congas in jamiroquai doesn’t call him anymore” while it may not be the most profound love story ever told it does achieve a bittersweet grace following a climactic tragedy and the story of these two lives is told with a light touch humour and a good understanding of their timecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address

the beginning of the book i thought of it as dull and boring but it wasnt until the third or fourth chapter which i became attached to it and didnt want to put the book down one of my fellow book club members had no interest in it at the beginning either and eventually just gave up on reading it however i believe that they did not give it enough time whatsoever the format i found to be odd but i enjoyed it because it was something different and out of my comfort zone i happened to think that it was like a camera taking you through memories that have happened over the years each and every year on that same july th day i was filled with laughter and interest nicholls in my opinion was very good with characterization he picked a good storyline of these two characters dex and emma who are in love but just wont ever admit it i was filled with joy and excitement when they would see each other again i felt as if they had a purpose and meaning to each other all the time whether they were together or notas another review had said this book will teach readers live everyday like its your last in the end of this book it really will affect the reader like it had done to myself it took me a little to cope with the line that hit me hard with shock the way it is written is very simple but it also includes some british slang its simple to say that readers will either fall in love with this book like myself or simply hate it and stop reading it after a few chapters if lucky give it a few this is a well written entertaining book filled with a mixture of feelings including sadness and humor that is worth spending your money on it would be for someone who can take a frustrating story one that does not go the way you want it to go at all times also for one who can be prepared for a sad story because sadness sure does tie in anyone can really read this book mainly women i would assume would enjoy reading this because it is a love story this is a fantastic heartwrenching book

noticed was and this may just be in the kindle edition which i read the use of alright instead of all right  all the time i mean in the first chapter alright was on almost every page did this guy not have a competent editor i really dislike seeing errors like that because they make me disrespect the writer andor his editor no excuse for that what tore the rag off the bush and when i quit reading was when i saw nauseous used to mean nauseated another egregious grammar error no excuse for it no matter how commonly this word is used incorrectly the other problem i had with this book was that i really didnt care about either character and couldnt imagine in what universe they would possibly have had a relationship i could see where emma might be attracted to dexter since he was a good looking bad boy but he was an alcoholic a cheater and a reprobate i cant imagine that dexter could care about emma since he seemed to care so little for anyone else except maybe his mother this relationship just strained my ability to understand or accept it there just wasnt much there no depth and that coupled with the grammar errors made me put this one down before i finished it i read more than i really wanted to because it is a book club selection and i felt compelled to keep at it but i have too many other books that i want to read and not enough time to waste on stuff like this young people and fans of romance novels might love it but if youre looking for good or even decent literature i recommend that you skip this mehcommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport

sports championships or awards even some songs and television commercials make me cry and so while it shouldnt come as a complete surprise to me david nicholls terrific book one day made me sob i mean i came completely unhinged egadsemma morley and dexter mayhew connect at a party the night they graduate from college in edinburgh dexter is goodlooking popular and privileged fairly unaware of the world around him except where it directly affects him emma of middle class origins considers herself to be a bit nonconformist although she has had a bit of a crush on dexter throughout college they nearly sleep together but spend about a day and a half in each others company and this sets in motion a connection that spans nearly  years one day follows the peaks and valleys of dexter and emmas relationship on the same dayjuly each year sometimes theyre close friends sometimes theyre not sometimes one is romantically involved while the other isnt sometimes one experiences career success while the other struggles one of the characters refers to emma and dexter as harry and sally and there is definitely elements of that film relationship in theirs but the book is funny thoughtprovoking emotionally charged and even a little maudlin from time to time especially if youre a sapthis is a book about love in many formsfriendship romance sexual attraction marriage parentchild relationships unrequited crushes etc as emma says at one point love and be loved if you ever get the chance the book may be a bit predictable at times and sometimes the characters arent completely likeable but i found this tremendously compelling and gripping it has been optioned into a movie and as much as i hate most film adaptations of books i love i will definitely need to see this one because much as its main characters felt about each other this book has gotten hold of my heart if youre a romanticor just a sap like meread this book read more top critical reviewsee all  critical reviews›  people found this helpful  out of  starsa tale of longing  loneliness cleverly disguised as a story of love  friendship not at all what i expectedbynicole don april  last year i got hooked on listening to audiobooks during my commute so ive been trolling amazon for reading material ever since i had remembered seeing the trailer for one day when it came out a few years back as a movie starring anne hathaway i recalled that it looked sweet and that i wanted to see it at the time i never did needless to say or i probably wouldnt have bought the audiobookanyway this was not at all what i expected the format is pretty unique the author david nicholls gives you a snapshot of the two lead characters  dexter mayhew and emma morley  on a single day each year for about a year period its interesting to see where they are in life  with each other other friends family careers other relationships etc i was very quickly drawn to the unconventional but very sweet bond that em  dex seemed to have with one another i think this was one thing that really had me hooked early oni actually quite liked the audiobook for the first several discs i listened to its something like  hours in total for the unabridged version nicholls does a great job giving the characters wit charm and personality i was very quickly hooked on the story and practically looked for excuses to run to the store or go out to pick up dinner so i could listen thats kind of pathetic i know i was not quite halfway done with the audiobook when i decided i couldnt wait to spend  more hours in the car before knowing what happened so i decided to rent the movie to watch on a lazy weekend day this was both a terrible mistake and a great idea on one hand i was quite impressed at how closely the movie stayed with the book that rarely happens but there were only two small parts that i noticed that had changed only slightly and i mean these were very minor parts of course the movie had to cut out about  of the book which really diluted the quality but overall it was a pretty close depiction of what nicholls put on paper i was not expecting what happens toward the last couple sections of the book i was glad that i watched the movie because i may have actually wrecked my car if id heard that unexpectedly while driving watching the movie also made me hate the story in a way because it was not what i wanted or what i expected for these characters i almost didnt finish the audiobook because i didnt want to waste my time building up to a conclusion that i hated but i did it was just as depressing and upsetting as i had expected but i was prepared for it so that was good i supposeall in all this is a book that i expected to be a sweet tale of friendship love and relationships and on the surface for the first  or so of the book it seems to be just this but given that the author is showing you a glimpse of their lives for one day a year for such a long period of time when you think of it it really is a depressing tale of longing loneliness and possibly a life wasted not going after what you truly want i prefer either horrible crime  mystery books or romantic love stories i dont like when the two intermix im not one to prefer a surprise ending to a book like this but maybe thats just me david nicholls if youre reading this youre an extremely talented writer but dont ever do that to me again to sum everything up dont bother with the movie because its depressing leaves out way too much and it will probably leave you angry like it did me if you like a sweet story and dont mind some unexpected twists and turns then youll probably really like this book if you happen to do audiobooks the narrator for this one is fantastic she speaks with an english accent which was a little distracting for me at first only because im not used to hearing the accent but after the first  minutes or so all my thoughts were suddenly floating around my head with a charming little accent and i was basically expecting everyone around me to sound like kate middleton when they spoke so dont let that bother you i give the narrator huge props though she does an amazing and seamless job swapping between all the different characters and somehow her male voices dont sound like a girl trying to speak in a mans voice they are very natural which made for an amazing audiobook experiencei just finished this yesterday so i still dont know how i feel about it i hated some of the things that happened and was not pleased at all with the ending but i was very delighted and entertained at many parts throughout so if youre an avid reader and havent picked this one up maybe go for it if you prefer something more predictable and upbeat ie without any depressing undertones skip it read more

through lifebyviola chenon august  format kindle editionverified purchaseon july   emma morley and dexter mayhew spend the night together after their graduation from university their whole lives are ahead of them lives full of potential promise and hope each chapter captures a snapshot of their lives on that day st swithins day each year for twenty years unfortunately the significance of this day is completely lost on american readers according to the folklore as stated on wikipedia whatever the weather is on st swithins day will continue for the next forty days i suppose groundhogs day would be the american analogue its a day that symbolizes how life can swing in either direction  sunny or rainy spring or winterthe appeal of this novel is its fresh and unique format  revisiting two people on the same day each year over twenty years how would their lives change year to year how would the characters develop over time how would their relationship progress and more interestingly what kind of creative storytelling could the author accomplishaside from the format its surprisingly difficult to describe what this book is about ive read reviews that characterize it as a love story it is not ive read reviews that liken it to when harry met sally again it is not if you go into this book with such notions youll be sorely disappointed yes the novel has some romantic undertones but characterizing it as a love story will create certain expectations that may go unrealized its about two people who happen to be friends fumbling through their twenties and thirties the author is quite good at portraying the simultaneous feelings of earnest hopefulness and terrifying aimlessness that characterizes the experience of many young adults today neither emma nor dexter knows what to do with the blank canvases that they were given they dont seem to know what they want out of life whether that is on a professional level or on a personal levelnicholls gives us a great set up emma morley is a smart idealistic girl from a workingclass family who isnt afraid to boycott or protest for certain causes dexter mayhew is a privileged playboy who parties just a little too much through their friendship emma always brings out the best in dexter but im not quite sure what he does for her these initial character sketches are believable realistic and charming however as the novel progresses the characters especially dexter become tiresome as a novel that relies so heavily on two people it has no choice but to be a characterdriven book and unfortunately it is the character development that is lacking in this book to be fair emmas character undergoes a satisfactory transformation it is dexters character that is dreadful he is a goodlooking spoiled drunk with too much money on his hands i get it but then i got tired of it i kept waiting for dexter to hit rock bottom so that he could rise instead he just bounced around the bottom without ever redeeming himself many recent college graduates feel lost and without direction i get that but does it really take twenty years to get your act together and even then im not entirely convinced that dexter ever didthe novel is easy to read it doesnt take long to breeze through the chapters the pacing is steady at a brisk medium speed the author sometimes takes advantage of the format by building suspense about what might happen on the very next day july th only to jump ahead a full year in the following chapter this is fun also the dialogue between the two main characters is a pleasure to read their casual banter is playful and perfectly expresses their closeness familiarity and comfort with each other most of this book is funny and light while a few parts are serious and dark all in all its not a bad book it just could have been so much bettercomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not found

later out of  starsnot my cup of literary teabydebra crosbyon september  format kindle editionverified purchasethis novel is clever and funny in parts however i had problems with it the first thing i noticed was and this may just be in the kindle edition which i read the use of alright instead of all right  all the time i mean in the first chapter alright was on almost every page did this guy not have a competent editor i really dislike seeing errors like that because they make me disrespect the writer andor his editor no excuse for that what tore the rag off the bush and when i quit reading was when i saw nauseous used to mean nauseated another egregious grammar error no excuse for it no matter how commonly this word is used incorrectly the other problem i had with this book was that i really didnt care about either character and couldnt imagine in what universe they would possibly have had a relationship i could see where emma might be attracted to dexter since he was a good looking bad boy but he was an alcoholic a cheater and a reprobate i cant imagine that dexter could care about emma since he seemed to care so little for anyone else except maybe his mother this relationship just strained my ability to understand or accept it there just wasnt much there no depth and that coupled with the grammar errors made me put this one down before i finished it i read more than i really wanted to because it is a book club selection and i felt compelled to keep at it but i have too many other books that i want to read and not enough time to waste on stuff like this young people and fans of romance novels might love it but if youre looking for good or even decent literature i recommend that you skip this mehcommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport

is the type of book that is either adored or despised and i find myself completely torn in the middle this book brought about many emotions i found myself laughing at loud at times i developed an attachment to the characters and became affected by the plot now and again i found myself tearing up and at one drastic point in the story i was unable to see the text through my tears a few pages later i was falling asleep due to boredom the story was occasionally intense and gripping and then nicholls transitioned back into his unremarkable and tedious material with all that in mind this story brought about a great amount of joy and emotional pain simultaneously i had split emotions while reading and after finishing have not yet settled on a definite outlook towards the novel putting my indecisive viewpoint aside this book was definitely an impactful read nicholls puts a tasteful twist on the commonly recognized love story plot the reader is presented with small glances into emma and dexter’s lives realistically humorous and unpredictable just as the plot finally begins to quicken and develop we are abruptly fastforwarded a year into the future commencing the next chapter this writing style is undoubtedly unique yet leaves countless unanswered questions i am still unsure if nicholls pulled it off but in any case one day is a novel worth readingcommentwas this review helpful

purchasefirst of all why is it  to buy for the kindle when you can buy it used for  but i digressas noted the book tells the story of two characters on the same day each year sometimes together and sometimes not she drove me nuts because she is so whiney and passive aggressive he is a slacker who life has just kind of worked out for eventually she rises and he falls and they are able to meet as equals and that is when the story gets good but it was a long time coming to get there wish i liked it more but not a waste of timecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert

been noted the novel follows  people through  years on the same day  july th  each year emma develops well as a character dexter does not parts were trite and tedious particularly dexters drug use and downward spiral neither of which is given much thought or explanation a convenient plot device especially towards the end of the book where it just doesnt work while i didnt necessarily want or think that the book should have had the perverbial happy ending the ending it does have is trite and not particularly satisfactory its as if the author had nothing else for the characters to do or say to each other or perhaps just got tired of the characters and couldnt figure out how to end and so dispatches with one of them i wanted to like dex and em i wanted to be sympathetic and empathetic in the end neither could elicit the sentiment the writing is charming the diaglog witty and sharp i just wish the characters and the book could have been a little more satisfyingcomment  people found this

and dexter both have such well done back stories personalities and detailed lives that it seems entirely possible that you could encounter either one in rl i had heard about the rave reviews and reception this book enjoyed in europe and i was eager to experience it for myself i read emma and dexters growing interpersonal history with growing fascination however  no spoilers  the last portion of the book truly caught me by surprise and it wasnt a pleasant surprise either for that reason the novel left me with an unsavory aftertaste and so my planned  star review dropped down to stars

really like anne hathaways charm and looking at the previews made me curious but i drag my feet when it comes to tvmovies etc realizing it was a book i purchased it for my kindle and all the way through i kept having this nagging feeling like i am not sure if i like this bookwhen the accident happened i felt bad not really for dexter but for em throughout the story yeah she evolves into this individual shes normal she had huge youthful aspirations none of which she could actually achieve at that point in her life anyway and fell into a place of well this sucks now what and it seems like she drops to the bottom of the bottom when she dates a guy who we as the reader know is completely wrong for her not that dexter was that much better eitherdexter on the other hand had a silver spoon in his mouth and was stuck on himself he just knew he had good looks he just knew he had talent as it was so greatly said about dexter he had it whatever it is and the worst part is he knew itwhat held me captive was the waiting for when the two lost souls mature enough to a place where they are officially ready for one another the whole book felt like the two were just never mature enough to handle each other one on one and it never happens em was cast as a support beam placed in the slot which many women find themselves being if they are waiting for i know hes mr right but hes got to come to his senses first she has to put up with the bull and mess with a mop and bucket on the sidelines before being rewarded with the diamondwhen dex and em do officially wind up together i was sorely disappointed it seemed at this point the author realized well the story has gone on long enough and theres not much more i can do to keep these two apart i used every plot device known to soap operas i guess i can put them together now it was rather painful for lack of a better term at am to watch it was kind of well im single now because my marriage failed and youre kind of single oh i cant because imokayin the end dex doesnt really some to his senses he hasnt grown up really he tempered down only because someone in their mid thirties no longer has an excuse in their twenties it oh im young he had no choice but to try and relinquish and even when he loses em for good he moves on with someone else to have filled her spot with a tiny bit of resistance bahperhaps i mightve been satisfied with him remaining single because he developed some personal growth but dex is dex and is always with someone never alone long enough to develop part of me even hoped that maybe years had gone by and he manages to remarry his first wife after they both changed into better people cuz they married under duress really and both relatively immature about itall in all the writing was soso the character development was almost nonexistent i was awfully disappointed and have grown less keen on watching the movie because i just dont see myself reliving this story sorry i think this one is surely a swing and a miss so why  stars i actually finished it didnt i there had to have been something interesting about itcommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product

one day and then watch the movie which i still havent gotten to and ultimately the book was pretty good emma and dex felt like real characters and real people who could actually exist now living in america there was a slight language barrier the jokes and some of the terminology they used went over my head but it didnt detract too much from the book in the beginning emma and dex meet and have a one night stand after that nicchols begins describing their lives on that same day july  every year after  the banter the two have is quite witty but the first few years nicchols describes are too long at the end of the book the sections are very short maybe even a little too short but because the beginning sections were so long it almost felt like a relief i read this with three other friends and we all had different opinions about dex who we called a charmer flirt bastard pig sweet guy well intentioned lazy etc and emma was smart boring unadventerous not willing to take risks sensible right and many other things its a fun experience but the beginning parts are lengthy if you can get through them its a worthwhile readcommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport
