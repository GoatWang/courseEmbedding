jennifer lombardo companies need that special something to draw in new customers and keep them coming back learn about competitive advantage and the different ways a company can have it competitive advantagewhy do you buy coke over pepsi why will you spend  on a pair of a certain brand of sneakers the answer lies in the term competitive advantage competitive advantage is a set of unique features of a company and its products that are perceived by the target market as significant and superior to the competition it is the reason behind brand loyalty and why you prefer one product or service over another there are three different types of competitive advantages that companies can actually use they are cost productservice differentiation and niche strategies cost competitive advantagecost competitive advantage is when a company is able to utilize its skilled workforce inexpensive raw materials controlled costs and efficient operations to create maximum value to consumers walmart uses the cost advantage strategy by providing a very large selection and low prices via its retailer strength and size costs can be kept at a minimum in many different ways some companies like nissan have years of experience producing cars in a very costeffective manner other companies use offshore manufacturing to keep the costs of their products down the current trend is for companies to cut down on the extras they offer to customers for example the airline company ryanair is removing two of its three toilets in each airplane to increase the number of seats and drive down ticket costs this might be an extreme way of cost cutting but companies need to survive in a recession companies may also receive government subsidies which help to pass on lower costs on to their customers one prime example is your local farm there are a few other important ways that costs can be kept lower in order for a company to use a cost competitive advantage technical companies such as bmw lexus and boeing use product design and reengineering to create efficient costeffective products product design is important to companies that use cuttingedge technology intel is able to keep microchip processor prices down by continually improving product design that utilizes advancements in the field reengineering is used by companies that are able to cut costs by redesigning and creating improvements to their products such as apple a company that finds ways to make its technology better and more affordable will find success finally some companies create a new delivery method for their product or service resulting in large cost savings that they can share with their customers many airline companies have installed selfcheckin kiosks and supermarkets now offer selfcheckout lanes productservice differentiationanother way that companies can have a competitive advantage in the marketplace is through productservice differentiation if a companys product or service has a valuable unique offering for its consumers then loyalty and productservice differentiation can occur cost competitive advantages can easily disappear with the introduction of a new competitor or new technology if a company offers a unique product or service it is harder to maintain an edge in the market based on price alone the company must offer something to the consumer besides just a low price offering kiosks and selfcheckout lanes are methods companies use to keep costs down some companies offer excellent product reliability such as honda an americanmade image such as harleydavidson a valuable brand name such as rolex or even excellent service such as mercedesbenz for companies to excel in this area of competitive advantage they must constantly look for ways to create new products and innovations that solve customer needs and wants a customer has to want their product or service because it offers something that they cannot get by going elsewhere  something very different × unlock content over

history english actsat science business psychology ap niche competitive advantagethe third way a company can create a competitive advantage is through creating a niche a niche competitive advantage seeks to target and reach a single segment of the market this type of strategy works very effectively for smaller and new companies that do not have the resources to go after larger sections of the marketplace a single segment of the market can be based on sex income lifestyle characteristics and even geography for example a bakery that only targets one zip code would be using a niche strategy also a bakery that only bakes treats for cats and dogs would also be using a niche advantage sometimes companies start out small with a niche strategy like when facebook was only available to college students but then they grow very successful and increase their market an example of geographic niche marketing is big red soda this product was originally only offered in texas it is still very difficult to locate nationwide with a market distribution only in and around texas the main challenge facing companies is the ability to keep their competitive advantage the most successful companies create an advantage that is unique just to the company and not easily copied rolex is known for superior products and ritzcarlton hotels are known for their unsurpassed customer service companies must constantly be aware of external threats from their competition that will try to copy their advantage or improve on it and take their customers lesson summarycompetitive advantage is a set of unique
