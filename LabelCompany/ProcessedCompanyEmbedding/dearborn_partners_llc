performance price change plus reinvested dividends since  advancing  for both the sp  and the dow jones industrial average us stocks made new alltime highs as they outperformed most of the other major asset classes during the  first half in addition us stocks have been the best performing asset class over the last  and  year periods ending june   the  year gross total return for the sp  increased  and the  year total return rose  ending june   the other major asset classes had returns for the first half of  as follows  month us treasury bills  long term us treasury bonds  investment grade corporate bonds  and gold  the highest quality stocks ranked b or better by merrill lynch  advanced slightly more for the first half  vs  compared to the lower quality stocks ranked b or worse we saw a major shift during the latter months of the first half as the higher quality growth companies substantially underperformed the lower quality companies the a rated companies only rose  while the c  d rated companies increased  this was primarily the result of the higher beta stocks responding to expectations of better global economic growth the equalweighted nifty fifty sp  largest companies recorded a positive return of  but modestly underperformed the other  stocks in the sp  for the first half  the msci ac world equity index ex us rose  in local currency outperforming us equities in us dollars the msci ac world index rose significantly by  reflecting the substantial depreciation of the us dollar during the  second quarter the msci emerging markets index local currency increased  during the first half many of the emerging economies are highly dependent upon commodities which experienced some price rebound during the half the us consumer price index cpi rose  for  through may the  first half was marked by increasing us employment decent corporate profit growth and optimism regarding legislative changes that would enhance us economic and corporate profit growth these included  lower corporate and individual income tax rates  a reduced regulatory environment  more us based manufacturing  lower healthcare costs for companies and individuals and  higher governmental spending on infrastructure and defense the best performing equity sectors during  first half were primarily focused on industries that were positively impacted by improving economic growth reduced governmental regulations and generally stocks with the highest betas the best performing sector price change only was technology  but it began to falter in june technology stocks contributed   percentage points of the sp  first half gain but had contributed as much as  prior to the june selloff the second best performing sector was health care  the third best performing sector was consumer discretionary  correspondingly the two worst performing sectors for the half were energy  and telecommunications  the energy sector suffered from lower crude oil prices and telecommunications reflected increased competition while us gdp growth is subpar as compared to prior economic recoveries the us economy is still showing signs of moderate growth however with the  change in administration the likelihood of  lower income taxes for companies and individuals  less regulatory requirements and  higher spending on infrastructure should provide a more positive environment for economic growth over the next few years as long as employment grows and real wages can experience some improvement the us economy should advance in  despite the difficulty in some other world economies dearborn partners envisions  us gdp growth to be in the area of   despite a slower growth rate in the first half on the positive side corporate earnings are doing reasonably well even though revenue growth continues to be moderate for many industries corporate margins remain near record highs productivity improvement and share repurchases by corporations have been an important contributor to the advance in earnings per share growth federal reserve policy is still very accommodative despite the recent rise in short term interest rates us employment is rising the unemployment rate is relatively low at  inflation continues to run below  modification of bank lending requirements doddfrank should help economic growth low energy prices should continue to help the level of disposable income for most families housing prices continue to show signs of improvement in most regions of the country the housing affordability index is still attractive due to low mortgage rates on the negative side inflationadjusted wage growth has been flat or falling for the last few years in addition the us employment participation rate  remains low since consumer spending accounts for about  of the us gdp this places pressure on domestic economic growth there is a shortage of skilled labor in a number of key industries especially for computer science and engineering the energy industry which has historically been an important sector for employment growth is still experiencing layoffs due to the sharp decline in energy prices finally income tax rates remain high following the passage of the affordable care act placing additional pressure on disposable income for upper income groups the top federal income tax rate is  before the impact of alternative minimum tax in general the higher quality companies that dominate our portfolios continue to generate improving free cash flow with earningsdividends advancing at a faster pace than inflation balance sheets are the best condition that we have seen in years due to higher capital positions lower cost of carrying debt as well as reduced overall debt levels productivity remains high and profit margins reflect management’s focus on cost

rising dividend fund ipast performance is not a guarantee of future performance dearborn partners llc was formed in  an independent privately held firm based in chicago dearborn partners manages assets for institutional and individual clients dearborn partners llc is the advisor to the dearborn partners rising dividend fund the fund invests in companies diversified across numerous sectors we seek to own a portfolio of companies with an average yield that exceeds the sp  index and that appear to have good prospects for annual dividend growth our objectives are current income rising income over time and longterm capital appreciation we endeavor to identify companies that appear likely to raise their dividends with regularity over time the combination of a current yield plus the potential for dividend increases can offer investors a fund that we believe should perform well in both rising and falling markets     mutual fund investing involves risk principal loss is possible the funds strategy of investing in dividendpaying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out favor with investors and underperform the market in addition there is the possibility that such companies could reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends in the future or the anticipated acceleration of dividends could not occur the fund may invest in foreign securities and adrs which involve political economic and currency risks greater volatility and differences in accounting methods medium and small capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than largecapitalization companies investments in reit securities involve risks such as declines in the value of real estate and increased susceptibility to adverse economic regulatory expenses the fund may invest in mlps which can be negatively influenced when interest rates rise these investments also entail many of the general tax risks of investing in a partnership there is always the risk that an mlp will fail to qualify for favorable tax treatments the dearborn partners rising dividend fund is offered only to united states residents and information on this site is intended only for
