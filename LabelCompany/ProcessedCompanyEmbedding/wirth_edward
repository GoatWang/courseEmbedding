became a notable gynecologist who later went to auschwitz to visit his brother to participate in cancer experiments but claimed he left after only a few days on his brother eduards advice due to a

assigned to auschwitz auschwitz edit dr wirths was promoted to sshauptsturmführer captain and appointed as chief camp physician at auschwitz in september  he was appointed on the basis of his reputation as a competent doctor and committed nazi who would be capable of stopping the typhus epidemics that had increasingly affected ss personnel at auschwitz at auschwitz wirths was known to be protective of prisoner doctors and other prisoners doing medical work to have improved conditions on the medical blocks and was remembered favourably by most prisoner doctors and other inmates who had contact with him at the same time wirths in recommending dr josef mengele for promotion in august  was able to speak of mengeles open honest firm … and absolutely dependable character and magnificent intellectual and physical talents of the discretion perseverance and energy with which he has fulfilled every task … and … shown himself equal to every situation of his valuable contribution to anthropological science by making use of the scientific materials available to him of his absolute ideological firmness and faultless conduct as an ss officer  and personal qualities as free unrestrained persuasive and lively discourse that rendered him especially dear to his comrades rudolf höss the commandant of auschwitz between  and december  is said to have held wirths in particularly high regard he is said to have remarked of wirths that during my  years of service in concentrationcamp affairs i have never encountered a better one  in  wirths benevolent and kind concern for the wellbeing of auschwitz inmates resulted in him receiving a christmas card from langbein a political prisoner who worked with him which contained the message “in the past year you have saved here the lives of  people we do not have the right to tell you our wishes but we wish for ourselves that you stay here in the coming year” it was signed “one speaking for the prisoners of auschwitz” the figure of  was the difference in mortality rate among prisoners from typhus in the year prior to wirths arrival prisoner experimentationedit wirths was involved in ordering medical experimentation particularly in gynecological and typhusrelated experimental tests wirthss primary research concerned precancerous growths of the cervix dr wirths was also interested in the sterilization of women by removing their ovaries through surgery or radiation it is generally acknowledged that he himself never directly participated in such experiments but delegated their conduct to subordinates the victims of these experiments were jewish women who had been imprisoned in block  of the main camp in auschwitz dr ewj pearce an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the truman medical center has made the following observation regarding wirths medical experiments    wirths without consent photographed the cervices of women prisoners then amputated the pictured cervices and sent both photographs and specimens for study to dr hinselmann of berlin hinselmann was the physician who developed colposcopy selection of prisonersedit importantly wirths also asserted medical control of prisoner selections at the auschwitzbirkenau camp which prior to spring  had been conducted by the camp commander and his subordinates wirths insisted upon taking his own personal turn in performing selections which he could have deferred to physician subordinates witness testimony given at the trial of adolf eichmann provided a useful insight into how the ss approached the issue of how to record the deaths of auschwitz prisoners this did not include those who had been immediately selected for gassing their admission was simply not recorded in the death registers those who died while imprisoned at auschwitz were always recorded as having died from natural causes and never from being executed or murdered wirths was promoted to sssturmbannführer major in september  following the evacuation of auschwitz in january  he was transferred along with many other former auschwitz personnel to the mittelbaudora concentration camp in thuringia wirths would again hold the post of chief camp physician until mittelbaudoras evacuation in april  capture and suicideedit wirths was captured by the allies at the end of the war and held in custody by british forces later on  september  knowing that he would surely face trial for numerous war crimes wirths committed suicide by hanging summary of criminal careeredit robert jay lifton has noted that    wirths was significantly immersed in nazi ideology in three crucial spheres the claim of revitalizing the german race and volk the biomedical path to that revitalization via purification of genes and race and the focus on the jews as a threat to this renewal to the immediate and longterm health of the germanic race while wirths did not absolutize these convictions in the manner of mengele — they were in him combined with a strong current of medical humanism — his commitment to the nazi cause was probably no less strong     perhaps illustrative of wirths commitment to medical leadership was his tendency while at auschwitz to drive about in a car flying a red cross flag as well as his enthusiasm for acting as a marriage counselor and personal adviser to other ss personnel according to helgard kramer wirths    first seized on a career as a military doctor and officer in the german elite troops of the ss because he desperately wanted to become a member of the upper class eventually to provide his future wife with a decent marriage to reach that goal he had to become a tough man  citation needed see alsoedit the holocaust nazi human experimentation josef mengele hans münch

acknowledged that he himself never directly participated in such experiments but delegated their conduct to subordinates the victims of these experiments were jewish women who had been imprisoned in block  of the main camp in auschwitz dr ewj pearce an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the truman medical center has made the following observation regarding wirths medical experiments    wirths without consent photographed the cervices of women prisoners then amputated the pictured cervices and sent both photographs and specimens for study to dr hinselmann of berlin hinselmann was the physician who developed colposcopy selection of prisonersedit importantly wirths also asserted medical control of prisoner selections at the auschwitzbirkenau camp which prior to spring  had been conducted by the camp commander and his subordinates wirths insisted upon taking his own personal turn in performing selections which he could have deferred to physician subordinates witness testimony given at the trial of adolf eichmann provided a useful insight into how the ss approached the issue of how to record the deaths of auschwitz prisoners this did not include those who had been immediately selected for gassing their admission was simply not recorded in the death registers those who died while imprisoned at auschwitz were always recorded as having died from natural

committed suicide by hanging summary of criminal careeredit robert jay lifton has noted that    wirths was significantly immersed in nazi ideology in three crucial spheres the claim of revitalizing the german race and volk the biomedical path to that revitalization via purification of genes and race and the focus on the jews as a threat to this renewal to the immediate and longterm health of the germanic race while wirths did not absolutize these convictions in the manner of mengele — they were in him combined with a strong current of medical humanism — his commitment to the nazi cause was probably no less strong     perhaps illustrative of wirths commitment to medical leadership was his tendency while at auschwitz to drive about in a car flying a red cross flag as well as his enthusiasm for acting as a marriage counselor and personal adviser to other ss personnel according to helgard kramer wirths    first seized on a career as a military doctor and officer in the german elite troops of the ss because he desperately wanted to become a member of the upper class eventually to provide his future wife with a decent marriage to reach that goal he had to become a tough man
