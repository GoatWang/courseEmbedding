investment increase diversification in your portfolio a stock fund could give you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of stocks which spreads out risk more than owning individual stocks get broad

complete list of vanguard stock funds do i want domestic or international stocks investing in both us and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already wellbalanced portfolio would i prefer index or active funds do you feel more comfortable tracking the market or would you rather try to beat it index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund while actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark they can also underperform compare index funds vs actively managed funds should i focus on a specific industry you can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market like health care technology or telecommunicationsbut remember these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk sector and specialty funds should only be used to supplement an already diversified

conviction actively managed asian equity portfolio built using a bottomup approach with little reference to a benchmark utilising aberdeen’s proven equity investment philosophy and approach that is replicated and consistent across all equity investment desks we seek to identify quality companies trading at reasonable valuations through our own first hand research   this fund is available on mfund – a way to access unlisted managed funds via the asx asx mfund code afz   objective to provide investors with high capital growth over the medium to long term  years by seeking exposure to the asian markets other than the japan market   about the fund the fund invests primarily in a concentrated portfolio of around  asian excluding japan listed securities with the potential for capital growth and increased earning potential our asian equity managers located in singapore bangkok kuala lumpur hong kong and jakarta seek to identify and invest in good quality asian listed securities quality is chiefly an evaluation of a company’s management balance sheet and business model only those companies which pass our rigorous quality screen are assessed for value we see risk in terms of investing in a poor quality company or overpaying for a good one and do not view risk in benchmark relative terms we therefore downplay benchmarks in portfolio construction since these provide little indication of future performance we are comfortable not holding companies if they do not satisfy our disciplined quality and valuation criteria regardless of their benchmark weight we never invest in a company without first meeting the management     fund highlights the fund aims to deliver the following benefits low turnover due to our ‘buy and hold’ approach  average holding period of around five years significant divergence from the benchmark longterm performance returns that exceed the benchmark low cash allocation as the aim is to be fully invested in securities   benchmark msci ac

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
