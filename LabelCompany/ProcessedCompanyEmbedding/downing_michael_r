lawyer for your first dwi you want someone who is going to get you out of the mess unscathed as a medical professional a lot was on the line to make sure i got out with nothing on my record as licensure is at stake denise listened to my entire story and spent hours in front of videos and audio recordings of the events in order to find an out she compassionately explained the entire process to me so that it wasnt so unknown she then explained what things i did right and wrong and what things the law inforcement did wrong in the end i got out with zero on my record thats after an accident involved dwi case that is almost impossible to do for those who dont know she allowed me to get back to my life and be able to breathe knowing that someone was handling my case who actually cared about who i was as a person she understands that people sometimes make mistakes but shouldnt suffer for the rest of their life for them i just cant say enough about how thankful i am to have chosen her she knows the system she was the only person who was willing to spend the time pouring over videos to find an out in the situation she did her homework and got me out clean dont go for some cheap guy who promises youll walk away from it with a parking or littering ticket dont be fooled itll still go on your record as amended go with someone who has been doing this for a long time knows the system and will spend the time researching your case and most important someone who actually cares about you as for me i highly suggest denise if i had to go through this whole terrible ordeal again i would definitely go with her every time she was really there for me and helped keep me calm during the process she even followed up a few weeks after just to make sure i got my license back in a timely fashion not only a great lawyer but also a great personlaw offices of davispingel  associatesdevin k rated stars do not do this law firm justice i went through a messy divorce a few years prior to meeting mr davis and mrs pingel i eventually decided it was time to go back to court after some issues with the original divorce decree i interviewed  lawyers in a  mile range one famous kc lawyer too  firms did not think i had enough evidence to modify my current paperwork  firm told me i took too long in my original meeting and charged me  so the last firm to meet with was davis and pingel i hired them on the spot they spent  years on my case years the length of time might seem long but i feel my case came with a high degree of difficulty the firm kept me updated on what they were working on in my case my bill court proceedings and everything else that involved my case phone calls were always returned emails were always answered and usually within an hour and my questions were always answered nobody wins in court but i feel victory was certainly accomplished in my case during the course of the battle i felt like i actually had family members working my case instead of an attorney they genuinely cared about the results and even asked on several occasions if the results were what i was looking for to close this out i will say something sillyi might have hired an attorney but i can say everyone at the firm is part of my family now b garry stewart attorney at lawshelby m ratedin october i separated from my husband and called mr stewart to represent me from the beginning until the end he was extremely polite courteous and on top of my case my experience with him was like no other attorney i have dealt with he was fair about pricing and very up front explaining every process and what obstacles in my case would possibly require more funds he gave me all options available and did not make me feel pressured about choosing the most expensive one my divorce was uncontested  days was required to lapse after filing in order to request a court date on day  garry called me first thing in the morning to inform me it was time to proceed i was in complete shock attorneys these days rarely call you let alone a day after the required minimum days have lapsed while in the courtroom he continued to explain every step with me just as he did from the beginning his approach to his work made my divorce process the best it could possibly be considering the situation there is no way i can thank him enough and even referred a friend to mr stewart if i ever need additional law representation i will definitely be calling garry stewart right awayb garry stewart attorney at lawshane l ratedbest lawyer ive ever had to say the least garry is a great honest man and will definitely get what ever situation needed resolved most reasonable youll find and very responsive with info or questions needed etc his total retainer and fees quote was substantially lower from any other attorney i contacted as well im in washington state and garry was my lawyer for an out of state situation for a period of over  months and i really couldnt of asked for better representation garry is also text friendly which was a huge convenience for me and never had any trouble getting a hold of him or garry returning my calls etc he was able to get my driving after suspension reduced to no registration which was a major break i was so fortunate to have found garrys add in the yellow pages he was able to get a significant reduction on my fines and court fees etc and didnt ask for any additional fees from me if youre looking for a honest and amazingly reliable lawyer then look no further you wont regret itb garry stewart attorney at lawjesse f ratedgarry stewart helped me in a stressful situation my snow plow was hit by a career criminal in a snow storm  days before christmas the man who hit me ran from the scene i had medical bills and was off work for a month from my injuries my case had been dragging for  months and the insurance company and prosecuting attorney were not taking my case seriously i heard that garry was a serious wellspoken attorney as soon as i called him he started getting things done he called the insurance company and let them know we werent messing around he went to court and i could see the other sides attorney getting nervous in  more months i paid off my medical bills with a large settlement and was even able to buy a new truck the man who hit and ran came out of hiding pled guilty with the city and lost his insurance garrys fee was much less than the other attorneys i talked with and i feel he gave my case more attention than they would have i feel justice happiness and relief great attorneylaw offices of davispingel  associateslaureen w ratedmy family doctor and counselor both recommended this firm i figure if two people i greatly respect made the same recommendation i could not go wrong i appreciated working with this law firm from the moment i called to make an initial appointment the receptionist was compassionate understanding and let me speak with one of the attorneys quickly from there they scheduled me quickly came up with a plan of action for my case and got things filed very quickly as promised when you are worried about your kids minutes can seem like years throughout the six months of my case i felt like they were on top of every issue and even at times they discussedraised issues that i had not thought of or considered in the end through their efforts to be prepared we ended up being able to settle the case with a better outcome than i could have hoped for i have thanked my doctor and my childrens counselor for the referral and suggested that they send everyone in need to this firm a b garry stewart attorney at lawrobert m ratedmr stewart has been my attorney for  years  years ago i was living out of state and needed help wrapping up some mo legal troubles i had no reservations in mailing my retainer to him and knew this matter would be resolved promptly and with unwavering professionalism he appeared in court  separate times on my behalf and resolved the issue completely hes also handled both of my divorces the experience described above is appalling to me because the proactive nature of business ive always experienced garry is in no way a lazy or incompetent attorney you can have faith in him i wouldnt have trusted him so many years with such sensitive legal issues you wont find a better attorneylaw offices of davispingel  associatesbob c ratedwe brought a family friend to attorney davis after i did an extensive research of the law firm on the internet to be honest i really didnt believe that this firm could live up to the reviews i foundafter the first appointment i saw that this firm indeed deserved the accolades they received our friend spoke english but not as first language the employees and the attorneys went above and way beyond to make sure she understood everything that was to be done and accomplishedattorney davis had the patience and professionalism i have not seen in a long time i highly recommend this law firm without the slightest reservation they all are fantastic people and truly care about their clientsb garry stewart attorney at lawmarian m ratedin the late s i had a client who owed us a large amount of money i was needing an attorney i asked the prosecuting attorney of jackson county for a referral of the most honest and dependable attorney he knew he recommended me to the stewart law firm he helped me bring closure to that scenario and was excellent in helping me form a corporation for my business he also supported us in estate settlements property transfers as well as personal counsel from day to day challenges of life were thankful for  years of faithful and dependable service from garry stewart and we will continue to use stewart law services in the futurelaw offices of davispingel  associatesmatt g ratedwhat can i say about patrick davis nothing negative this gentleman helped me through some of the most trying days of my life helped me keep my sanity and positive attitude throughout the entire process which took months with my legal matters regarding my son i have gone through this process with other attorneys in the last  years and none of them came close to the service that this man gave me this

and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off
