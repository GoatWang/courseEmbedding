programmes events events walks publications donate search curriculum theory and practice curriculum theory and practicethe organization of schooling and further education has long been associated with the idea of a curriculum  but what actually is curriculum and how might it be conceptualized we explore curriculum theory and practice and its relation to informal education contents introduction · curriculum as transmission · curriculum as product · curriculum as process · curriculum as praxis · curriculum and context · curriculum and informal education · further reading · links · how to cite this article the idea of curriculum is hardly new – but the way we understand and theorize it has altered over the years – and there remains considerable dispute as to meaning it has its origins in the runningchariot tracks of greece it was literally a course in latin curriculum was a racing chariot currere was to run a useful starting point for us here might be the definition offered by john kerr and taken up by vic kelly in his standard work on the subject kerr defines curriculum as ‘all the learning which is planned and guided by the school whether it is carried on in groups or individually inside or outside the school quoted in kelly   see also kelly  this gives us some basis to move on – and for the moment all we need to do is highlight two of the key features learning is planned and guided we have to specify in advance what we are seeking to achieve and how we are to go about it the definition refers to schooling we should recognize that our current appreciation of curriculum theory and practice emerged in the school and in relation to other schooling ideas such as subject and lesson in what follows we are going to look at four ways of approaching curriculum theory and practice  curriculum as a body of knowledge to be transmitted  curriculum as an attempt to achieve certain ends in students – product  curriculum as process  curriculum as praxis it is helpful to consider these ways of approaching curriculum theory and practice in the light of aristotle’s influential categorization of knowledge into three disciplines the theoretical the productive and the practical here we can see some clear links – the body of knowledge to be transmitted in the first is that classically valued as ‘the canon’ the process and praxis models come close to practical deliberation and the technical concerns of the outcome or product model mirror elements of aristotle’s characterization of the productive more this will be revealed as we examine the theory underpinning individual models curriculum as a syllabus to be transmitted many people still equate a curriculum with a syllabus syllabus naturally originates from the greek although there was some confusion in its usage due to early misprints basically it means a concise statement or table of the heads of a discourse the contents of a treatise the subjects of a series of lectures in the form that many of us will have been familiar with it is connected with courses leading to examinations – teachers talk of the syllabus associated with say the cambridge board  french gsce exam what we can see in such documents is a series of headings with some additional notes which set out the areas that may be examined a syllabus will not generally indicate the relative importance of its topics or the order in which they are to be studied in some cases as curzon  points out those who compile a syllabus tend to follow the traditional textbook approach of an ‘order of contents’ or a pattern prescribed by a ‘logical’ approach to the subject or  – consciously or unconsciously – a the shape of a university course in which they may have participated thus an approach to curriculum theory and practice which focuses on syllabus is only really concerned with content curriculum is a body of knowledgecontent andor subjects education in this sense is the process by which these are transmitted or ‘delivered’ to students by the most effective methods that can be devised blenkin et al   where people still equate curriculum with a syllabus they are likely to limit their planning to a consideration of the content or the body of knowledge that they wish to transmit ‘it is also because this view of curriculum has been adopted that many teachers in primary schools’ kelly   claims ‘have regarded issues of curriculum as of no concern to them since they have not regarded their task as being to transmit bodies of knowledge in this manner’ curriculum as product the dominant modes of describing and managing education are today couched in the productive form  education is most often seen as a technical exercise  objectives are set a plan drawn up then applied and the outcomes products measured  it is a way of thinking about education that has grown in influence in the united kingdom since the late s with the rise of vocationalism and the concern with competencies  thus in the late s and the s many of the debates about the national curriculum for schools did not so much concern how the curriculum was thought about as to what its objectives and content might be it is the work of two american writers franklin bobbitt   and ralph w tyler  that dominate theory and practice within this tradition  in the curriculum  bobbitt writes as follows the central theory of curriculum is simple  human life however varied consists in the performance of specific activities  education that prepares for life is one that prepares definitely and adequately for these specific activities  however numerous and diverse they may be for any social class they can be discovered  this requires only that one go out into the world of affairs and discover the particulars of which their affairs consist  these will show the abilities attitudes habits appreciations and forms of knowledge that men need  these will be the objectives of the curriculum  they will be numerous definite and particularized  the curriculum will then be that series of experiences which children and youth must have by way of obtaining those objectives    this way of thinking about curriculum theory and practice was heavily influenced by the development of management thinking and practice  the rise of ‘scientific management’ is often associated with the name of its main advocate f w taylor  basically what he proposed was greater division of labour with jobs being simplified an extension of managerial control over all elements of the workplace and cost accounting based on systematic timeandmotion study  all three elements were involved in this conception of curriculum theory and practice  for example one of the attractions of this approach to curriculum theory was that it involved detailed attention to what people needed to know in order to work live their lives and so on  a familiar and more restricted example of this approach can be found in many training programmes where particular tasks or jobs have been analyzed – broken down into their component elements – and lists of competencies drawn up  in other words the curriculum was not to be the result of ‘armchair speculation’ but the product of systematic study  bobbitt’s work and theory met with mixed responses  one telling criticism that was made and can continue to be made of such approaches is that there is no social vision or programme to guide the process of curriculum construction  as it stands it is a technical exercise  however it wasn’t criticisms such as this which initially limited the impact of such curriculum theory in the late s and s  rather the growing influence of ‘progressive’ childcentred approaches shifted the ground to more romantic notions of education  bobbitt’s long lists of objectives and his emphasis on order and structure hardly sat comfortably with such forms the progressive movement lost much of its momentum in the late s in the united states and from that period the work of ralph w tyler in particular has made a lasting impression on curriculum theory and practice  he shared bobbitt’s emphasis on rationality and relative simplicity  his theory was based on four fundamental questions  what educational purposes should the school seek to attain  what educational experiences can be provided that are likely to attain these purposes  how can these educational experiences be effectively organized  how can we determine whether these purposes are being attained  tyler   like bobbitt he also placed an emphasis on the formulation of behavioural objectives since the real purpose of education is not to have the instructor perform certain activities but to bring about significant changes in the students’ pattern of behaviour it becomes important to recognize that any statements of objectives of the school should be a statement of changes to take place in the students  tyler   we can see how these concerns translate into a nicelyordered procedure  one that is very similar to the technical or productive thinking set out below step  diagnosis of need step  formulation of objectives step  selection of content step  organization of content step  selection of learning experiences step  organization of learning experiences step  determination of what to evaluate and of the ways and means of doing it taba  the attraction of this way of approaching curriculum theory and practice is that it is systematic and has considerable organizing power  central to the approach is the formulation of behavioural objectives – providing a clear notion of outcome so that content and method may be organized and the results evaluated there are a number of issues with this approach to curriculum theory and practice the first is that the plan or programme assumes great importance  for example we might look at a more recent definition of curriculum as ‘a programme of activities by teachers and pupils designed so that pupils will attain so far as possible certain educational and other schooling ends or objectives grundy   the problem here is that such programmes inevitably exist prior to and outside the learning experiences  this takes much away from learners  they can end up with little or no voice  they are told what they must learn and how they will do it  the success or failure of both the programme and the individual learners is judged on the basis of whether prespecified changes occur in the behaviour and person of the learner the meeting of behavioural objectives  if the plan is tightly adhered to there can only be limited opportunity for educators to make use of the interactions that occur it also can deskill educators in another way  for example a number of curriculum programmes particularly in the usa have attempted to make the student experience ‘teacher proof’  the logic of this approach is for the curriculum to be designed outside of the classroom or school as is the case with the national curriculum in the uk  educators then apply programmes and are judged by the products of their actions  it turns educators into technicians second there are questions around the nature of objectives  this model is hot on measurability  it implies that behaviour can be objectively mechanistically measured  there are obvious dangers here – there always has to be some uncertainty about what is being measured  we only have to reflect on questions of success in our work  it is often very difficult to judge what the impact of particular experiences has been  sometimes it is years after the event that we come to appreciate something of what has happened  for example most informal educators who have been around a few years will have had the experience of an exparticipant telling them in great detail about how some forgotten event forgotten to the worker that is brought about some fundamental change  yet there is something more in order to measure things have to be broken down into smaller and smaller units  the result as many of you will have experienced can be long lists of often trivial skills or competencies  this can lead to a focus in this approach to curriculum theory and practice on the parts rather than the whole on the trivial rather than the significant  it can lead to an approach to education and assessment which resembles a shopping list  when all the items are ticked the person has passed the course or has learnt something  the role of overall judgment is somehow sidelined third there is a real problem when we come to examine what educators actually do in the classroom for example  much of the research concerning teacher thinking and classroom interaction and curriculum innovation has pointed to the lack of impact on actual pedagogic practice of objectives see stenhouse  and cornbleth  for example   one way of viewing this is that teachers simply get it wrong – they ought to work with objectives  i think we need to take this problem very seriously and not dismiss it in this way  the difficulties that educators experience with objectives in the classroom may point to something inherently wrong with the approach – that it is not grounded in the study of educational exchanges  it is a model of curriculum theory and practice largely imported from technological and industrial settings fourth there is the problem of unanticipated results  the focus on prespecified goals may lead both educators and learners to overlook learning that is occurring as a result of their interactions but which is not listed as an objective the apparent simplicity and rationality of this approach to curriculum theory and practice and the way in which it mimics industrial management have been powerful factors in its success  a further appeal has been the ability of academics to use the model to attack teachers i believe there is a tendency recurrent enough to suggest that it may be endemic in the approach for academics in education to use the objectives model as a stick with which to beat teachers  ‘what are your objectives’ is more often asked in a tone of challenge than one of interested and helpful inquiry  the demand for objectives is a demand for justification rather than a description of ends… it is not about curriculum design but rather an expression of irritation in the problems of accountability in education  stenhouse   so what are the other alternatives curriculum as process we have seen that the curriculum as product model is heavily dependent on the setting of behavioural objectives  the curriculum essentially is a set of documents for implementation  another way of looking at curriculum theory and practice is via process  in this sense curriculum is not a physical thing but rather the interaction of teachers students and knowledge  in other words curriculum is what actually happens in the classroom and what people do to prepare and evaluate  what we have in this model is a number of elements in constant interaction   it is an active process and links with the practical form of reasoning set out by aristotle curriculum as process teachers enter particular schooling and situations with an ability to think critically inaction an understanding of their role and the expectations others have of them and a proposal for action which sets out essential principles and features of the educational encounter guided by these they encourage conversations between and with people in the situation out of which may come thinking and action they continually evaluate the process and what they can see of outcomes perhaps the two major things that set this apart from the model for informal education are first the context in which the process occurs ‘particular schooling situations’ and second the fact that teachers enter the classroom or any other formal educational setting with a more fully workedthrough idea of what is about to happen  here i have described that as entering the situation with ‘a proposal for action which sets out essential principles and features of the educational encounter’ this form of words echoes those of lawrence stenhouse  who produced one of the bestknown explorations of a process model of curriculum theory and practice he defined curriculum tentatively ‘a curriculum is an attempt to communicate the essential principles and features of an educational proposal in such a form that it is open to critical scrutiny and capable of effective translation into practice’ he suggests that a curriculum is rather like a recipe in cookery it can be criticized on nutritional or gastronomic grounds – does it nourish the students and does it taste good – and it can be criticized on the grounds of practicality – we can’t get hold of six dozen larks’ tongues and the grocer can’t find any ground unicorn horn  a curriculum like the recipe for a dish is first imagined as a possibility then the subject of experiment  the recipe offered publicly is in a sense a report on the experiment  similarly a curriculum should be grounded in practice  it is an attempt to describe the work observed in classrooms that it is adequately communicated to teachers and others  finally within limits a recipe can varied according to taste  so can a curriculum  stenhouse   stenhouse shifted the ground a little bit here  he was not saying that curriculum is the process but rather the means by which the experience of attempting to put an educational proposal into practice is made available  the reason why he did this i suspect is that otherwise there is a danger of widening the meaning of the term so much that it embraces almost everything and hence means very little  for example in a discussion of the socalled ‘youth work curriculum’ newman  ingram  the following definition was taken as a starting point ‘those processes which enhance or if they go wrong inhibit a person’s learning’ this was then developed and a curriculum became ‘an organic process by which learning is offered accepted and internalized’ newman  ingram   the problem with this sort of definition as robin barrow  points out is that what this does is to widen the meaning of the term to such an extent that it just about becomes interchangeable with ‘education’ itself  more specifically if curriculum is process then the word curriculum is redundant because process would do very nicely   the simple equation of curriculum with process is a very slaphappy basis on which to proceed we also need to reflect on why curriculum theory and practice came into use by educators as against policymakers  it was essentially as a way of helping them to think about their work before during and after interventions as a means of enabling educators to make judgments about the direction their work was taking  this is what stenhouse was picking up on stenhouse on curriculum as a minimum a curriculum should provide a basis for planning a course studying it empirically and considering the grounds of its justification  it should offer a in planning  principle for the selection of content – what is to be learned and taught  principles for the development of a teaching strategy – how it is to be learned and taught  principles for the making of decisions about sequence  principles on which to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of individual students and differentiate the general principles   and  above to meet individual cases b in empirical study  principles on which to study and evaluate the progress of students  principles on which to study and evaluate the progress of teachers  guidance as to the feasibility of implementing the curriculum in varying school contexts pupil contexts environments and peergroup situations  information about the variability of effects in differing contexts and on different pupils and an understanding of the causes of the variation c in relation to justification a formulation of the intention or aim of the curriculum which is accessible to critical scrutiny stenhouse   there are a number of contrasts in this model of curriculum theory and practice as compared with the product model  first where the product model appeals to the workshop for a model this process model looks to the world of experimentation the idea is that of an educational science in which each classroom is a laboratory each teacher a member of the scientific community…  the crucial point is that the proposal is not to be regarded as an unqualified recommendation but rather as a provisional specification claiming no more than to be worth putting to the test of practice  such proposals claim to be intelligent rather than correct  stenhouse   thus in this sense a curriculum is a particular form of specification about the practice of teaching  it is not a package of materials or a syllabus of ground to be covered  ‘it is a way of translating any educational idea into a hypothesis testable in practice  it invites critical testing rather than acceptance’ stenhouse   second and associated with the above given the uniqueness of each classroom setting it means that any proposal even at school level needs to be tested and verified by each teacher in hisher classroom ibid   it is not like a curriculum package which is designed to be delivered almost anywhere third outcomes are no longer the central and defining feature  rather than tightly specifying behavioural objectives and methods in advance what happens in this model of curriculum theory and practice is that content and means develop as teachers and students work together fourth the learners in this model are not objects to be acted upon  they have a clear voice in the way that the sessions evolve  the focus is on interactions  this can mean that attention shifts from teaching to learning  the product model by having a prespecified plan or programme tends to direct attention to teaching  for example how can this information be got over  a process approach to curriculum theory and practice it is argued by writers like grundy  tends towards making the process of learning the central concern of the teacher  this is because this way of thinking emphasizes interpretation and meaningmaking  as we have seen each classroom and each exchange is different and has to be made sense of however when we come to think about this way of approaching curriculum in practice a number of possible problems do arise  the first is a problem for those who want some greater degree of uniformity in what is taught  this approach to the theory of curriculum because it places meaningmaking and thinking at its core and treats learners as subjects rather than objects can lead to very different means being employed in classrooms and a high degree of variety in content   as stenhouse comments the process model is essentially a critical model not a marking model it can never be directed towards an examination as an objective without loss of quality since the standards of the examination then override the standards immanent in the subject  this does not mean that students taught on the process model cannot be examined but it does mean that the examinations must be taken in their stride as they pursue other aspirations  and if the examination is a byproduct there is an implication that the quality the student shows in it must be an underestimate of his real quality  it is hence rather difficult to get the weak student through an examination using a process model  crammers cannot use it since it depends upon a commitment to educational aims  stenhouse   to some extent variation is limited by factors such as public examinations  the exchange between students and teachers does not float free of the context in which it arises  at the end of the day many students and their families place a high premium on exam or subject success and this inevitably enters into the classroom  this highlights a second problem with the model we have just outlined – that it may not pay enough attention to the context in which learning takes place more of this later third there is the ‘problem’ of teachers   the major weakness and indeed strength of the process model is that it rests upon the quality of teachers  if they are not up to much then there is no safety net in the form of prescribed curriculum materials  the approach is dependent upon the cultivation of wisdom and meaningmaking in the classroom  if the teacher is not up to this then there will be severe limitations on what can happen educationally  there have been some attempts to overcome this problem by developing materials and curriculum packages which focus more closely on the ‘process of discovery’ or ‘problemsolving’ for example in science  but there is a danger in this approach  processes become reduced to sets of skills – for example how to light a bunsen burner  when students are able to demonstrate certain skills they are deemed to have completed the process  as grundy comments the actions have become the ends the processes have become the product  whether or not students are able to apply the skills to make sense of the world around them is somehow overlooked grundy   fourth we need to look back at our process model of curriculum theory and practice and what we have subsequently discussed and return to aristotle and to freire  the model we have looked at here does not fully reflect the process explored earlier  in particular it does not make explicit the commitments associated with phronesis  and it is to that we will now turn curriculum as praxis curriculum as praxis is in many respects a development of the process model  while the process model is driven by general principles and places an emphasis on judgment and meaning making it does not make explicit statements about the interests it serves   it may for example be used in such a way that does not make continual reference to collective human wellbeing and to the emancipation of the human spirit  the praxis model of curriculum theory and practice brings these to the centre of the process and makes an explicit commitment to emancipation   thus action is not simply informed it is also committed  it is praxis critical pedagogy goes beyond situating the learning experience within the experience of the learner it is a process which takes the experiences of both the learner and the teacher and through dialogue and negotiation recognizes them both as problematic…  it allows indeed encourages students and teachers together to confront the real problems of their existence and relationships… when students confront the real problems of their existence they will soon also be faced with their own oppression grundy   we can amend our ‘curriculum as process’ model to take account of these concerns curriculum as praxis teachers enter particular schooling and situations with a personal but shared idea of the good and a commitment to human emancipation an ability to think critically inaction an understanding of their role and the expectations others have of them and a proposal for action which sets out essential principles and features of the educational encounter guided by these they encourage conversations between and with people in the situation out of which may come informed and committed action they continually evaluate the process and what they can see of outcomes in this approach the curriculum itself develops through the dynamic interaction of action and reflection ‘that is the curriculum is not simply a set of plans to be implemented but rather is constituted through an active process in which planning acting and evaluating are all reciprocally related and integrated into the process’ grundy   at its centre is praxis informed committed action how might we recognize this first i think we should be looking for practice which does not focus exclusively on individuals but pays careful attention to collective understandings and practices and to structural questions  for example in sessions which seek to explore the experiences of different cultural and racial groups in society we could be looking to see whether the direction of the work took people beyond a focus on individual attitudes  are participants confronting the material conditions through which those attitudes are constituted for example second we could be looking for a commitment expressed in action to the exploration of educators’ values and their practice  are they for example able to say in a coherent way what they think makes for human wellbeing and link this with their practice  we could also be looking for certain values – especially an emphasis on human emancipation third we could expect practitioners committed to praxis to be exploring their practice with their peers  they would be able to say how their actions with respect to particular interventions reflected their ideas about what makes for the good and to say what theories were involved curriculum in context to round off this discussion of curriculum we do need to pay further attention  to the social context in which it is created  one criticism that has been made of the praxis model especially as it is set out by grundy is that it does not place a strong enough emphasis upon context  this is a criticism that can also be laid at the door of the other approaches  in this respect the work of catherine cornbleth  is of some use  she sees curriculum as a particular type of process  curriculum for her is what actually happens in classrooms that is ‘an ongoing social process comprised of the interactions of students teachers knowledge and milieu’    in contrast stenhouse defines curriculum as the attempt to describe what happens in classrooms rather than what actually occurs  cornbleth further contends that curriculum as practice cannot be understood adequately or changed substantially without attention to its setting or context  curriculum is contextually shaped   while i may quibble about the simple equation of curriculum with process what cornbleth does by focusing on the interaction is to bring out the significance of context first by introducing the notion of milieu into the discussion of curriculum she again draws attention to the impact of some factors that we have already noted  of especial significance here are examinations and the social relationships of the school – the nature of the teacherstudent relationship the organization of classes streaming and so on  these elements are what are sometimes known as the hidden curriculum  this was a term credited to philip w jackson  but it had been present as an acknowledged element in education for some time before  for example john dewey in experience and education referred to the ‘collateral learning’ of attitudes that occur in schools and that may well be of more longrange importance than the explicit school curriculum    a fairly standard product definition of the ‘hidden curriculum’ is given by vic kelly  he argues it is those things which students learn ‘because of the way in which the work of the school is planned and organized but which are not in themselves overtly included in the planning or even in the consciousness of those responsible for the school arrangements   the learning associated with the ‘hidden curriculum’ is most often treated in a negative way  it is learning that is smuggled in and serves the interests of the status quo  the emphasis on regimentation on bells and time management and on streaming are sometimes seen as preparing young people for the world of capitalist production  what we do need to recognize is that such ‘hidden’ learning is not all negative and can be potentially liberating ‘in so far as they enable students to develop socially valued knowledge and skills… or to form their own peer groups and subcultures they may contribute to personal and collective autonomy and to possible critique and challenge of existing norms and institutions’  cornbleth   what we also need to recognize is that by treating curriculum as a contextualized social process the notion of hidden curriculum becomes rather redundant  if we need to stay in touch with milieu as we build curriculum then it is not hidden but becomes a central part of our processes second by paying attention to milieu we can begin to get a better grasp of the impact of structural and sociocultural process on teachers and students  as cornbleth argues economic and gender relations for example do not simply bypass the systemic or structural context of curriculum and enter directly into classroom practice  they are mediated by intervening layers of the education system cornbleth    thus the impact of these factors may be quite different to that expected third if curriculum theory and practice is inextricably linked to milieu then it becomes clear why there have been problems about introducing it into nonschooling contexts like youth work and it is to this area which we will now turn curriculum as the boundary between formal and informal education jeffs and smith   have argued that the notion of curriculum provides a central dividing line between formal and informal education  they contend that curriculum theory and practice was formed within the schooling context and that there are major problems when it is introduced into informal forms of pedagogy the adoption of curriculum theory and practice by some informal educators appears to have arisen from a desire to be clear about content  yet there are crucial difficulties with the notion of curriculum in this context these centre around the extent to which it is possible to have a clear idea in advance and even during the process of the activities and topics that will be involved in a particular piece of work at any one time outcomes may not be marked by a high degree of specificity  in a similar way the nature of the activities used often cannot be predicted  it may be that we can say something about how the informal educator will work  however knowing in advance about broad processes and ethos isn’t the same as having a knowledge of the programme  we must thus conclude that approaches to the curriculum which focus on objectives and detailed programmes appear to be incompatible with informal education jeffs  smith   in other words they are arguing that a product model of curriculum is not compatible with the emphasis on process and praxis within informal education however process and praxis models of curriculum also present problems in the context of informal education  if you look back at at our models of process and compare them with the model of informal education presented above then it is clear that we can have a similar problem with prespecification  one of the key feature that differentiates the two is that the curriculum model has the teacher entering the situation with a proposal for action which sets out the essential principles and features of the educational encounter informal educators do not have and do not need this element  they do not enter with a clear proposal for action  rather they have an idea of what makes for human wellbeing and an appreciation of their overall role and strategy strategy here being some idea about target group and broad method eg detached work  they then develop their aims and interventions in interaction  and what is this element we have been discussing  it is nothing more nor less than what stenhouse considers to be a curriculum the other key difference is context  even if we were to go the whole hog and define curriculum as process there remain substantive problems  as cornbleth  and jeffs and smith   have argued curriculum cannot be taken out of context and the context in which it was formed was the school  curriculum theory and practice only makes sense when considered alongside notions like class teacher course lesson and so on  you only have to look at the language that has been used by our main proponents tyler stenhouse cornbleth and grundy to see this  it is not a concept that stands on its own  it developed in relation to teaching and within particular organizational relationships and expectations  alter the context and the nature of the process alters   we then need different ways of describing what is going on  thus it is no surprise that when curriculum theory and practice are introduced into what are essentially informal forms of working such as youth work and community work their main impact is to formalize significant aspects of the work   one of the main outcome of curriculum experiments within youth work has been work for example in the field of health promotion which involve prespecified activities visiting workers regular meetings and so on   within the language of youth work these are most often called programmes or projects foreman   within a school they would be called a course what is being suggested here is that when informal educators take on the language of curriculum they are crossing the boundary between their chosen specialism and the domain of formal education  this they need to do from time to time  there will be formal interludes in their work appropriate times for them to mount courses and to discuss content and method in curriculum terms  but we should not fall into the trap of thinking that to be educators we have to adopt curriculum theory and practice  the fact that so many have been misled into believing this demonstrates just how powerful the ideas of schooling are  education is something more than schooling conclusion we have explored four different approaches to curriculum theory and practice curriculum as a body of knowledge to be transmitted curriculum as an attempt to achieve certain ends in students – product curriculum as process curriculum as praxis in a number of respects these different bodies of curriculum theory and practice link to the four main forces in north american curriculummaking in the twentieth century the liberal educators the scientific curriculum makers the developmentalpersoncentred and the social meliorists those that sought more radical social change after kliebart    the liberal educators the scientific curriculum makers the develop mentalists the social meliorists orientation guardians of an ancient tradition tied to the power of reason and the finest elements of the western cultural heritage human life  consists in the performance of specific activities  education that prepares for life is one that prepares definitely and adequately for these specific activities   the natural order of development in the child was most significant and scientifically defensible basis for determining what should be taught schools as a major perhaps the principal force for social change and social justice curriculum systematic development of reasoning power and the communication of ‘the canon’ influenced by the rise of scientific management and notions of social efficiency focus on setting objectives the statement of changes to take place in the students and the organization of schooling to meet these  sought a curriculum in harmony with the child’s ‘real’ interests needs  and learning patterns corruption and vice inequalities of race and gender and the abuse of privilege and power should be addressed directly with the aim of raising a new generation equipped to deal effectively with these abuses key thinkers charles w taylor franklin bobbitt  and ralph w tyler g stanley hall lester frank ward linked to transmission product process praxis   we shouldn’t push the similarities too far – but there are some interesting overlaps – and this does alert us both to the changing understanding and to shifting policy orientations over time for the moment we are having to operate within a policy environment that prizes the productive and technical furthermore the discourse has become so totalizing that forms of education that do not have a curricula basis are squeezed the temptation is always there to either be colonized by curriculum theory or adopt ways of describing practice that do not make sense in terms of the processes and commitments involved kleibart’s analysis provides us with some hope – things will change however there is no guarantee that they will move in a more
