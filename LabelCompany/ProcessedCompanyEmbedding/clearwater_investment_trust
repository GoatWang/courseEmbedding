about us equity valuations written by ronald granberg on thursday  september  posted in blog coauthored by ron granberg cfa  john lombardo cfa of bluewater capital management llc it has been said that there are multiple stages leading to the acceptance of a great truth it may initially be dismissed as absurd then violently opposed and finally accepted as though it were never in doubt warnings of investment bubbles follow a similar pattern because valuations correlate poorly with returns over the subsequent onetotwo years early warnings that valuations are becoming stretched are often dismissed as stocks surge higher as valuations rise further into the stratosphere such warnings draw the ire of most investment professionals whose counterattack typically relies on new valuation criteria arguments that historically sound valuation metrics are no longer valid and talk of “new eras” when the bubble collapses investors are left with steep losses and selfrecrimination as they realize the market was indeed seriously overvalued currently we appear to be in the second stage of truth regarding the bubble in us equities the third in just the last  years the current narrative rests largely on the fallacy that you “can’t fight the fed” its corollary that investors must buy equities due to absurdly low bond yields and that pricetoearnings ratios remain reasonable the problem with this narrative is that easy monetary policy is not prophylactic against bear market declines and simple trailing and forward pricetoearnings multiples are not reliable indicators of subsequent equity market returns first let’s address the argument that you “can’t fight the fed” simply put you could have followed that mantra down the rabbit’s hole in each of the last two bear markets during  the fed cut the fed funds rate from  to  where it remained until a  cut in november  from january  through september  the sp  declined  similarly the central bank lowered its benchmark rate from  to just  from september  through april  at which point what turned out to be one of the worst bear markets in history was still being called a correction by december  the fed had cut the rate to  where it remains today for those keeping score from the fed’s first rate cut in september  through the market lows in march  the sp  fell more than  in short “fighting the fed” can be challenging but failing to do so in the aftermath of one of their liquidity driven bubbles can be damaging to your financial health while fed largesse can induce complacency and provide fuel for a bubble it’s of no consequence whatsoever once investors begin to reprice risk  second those suggesting market valuations are reasonable are either misinformed or disingenuous we have often heard investment professional’s state that “valuations are not demanding” yet such statements reference price relative to either trailing or forecasted earnings neither of which correlate strongly with returns over the subsequent seven to years lacking organic revenue growth corporations have driven per share earnings higher through massive stock buyback programs while the ratio of insiders buying to those selling is among the lowest in the last  years additionally earnings have benefited from new alltime highs in profit margins despite weak revenue growth due to significant declines in labor and interest expense revenue will only be driven higher if consumer incomes begin to rise and that will likely be accompanied by rate normalization any further reduction in interest and labor expense would likely only occur if the economy returns to recession further reducing revenue in short investors would be wise to remember that profit margins among the most mean reverting statistics in finance are likely to revert yet again as such today’s valuations are far more excessive that simple priceearnings ratios suggest meanwhile valuation metrics such as robert shiller’s cyclically adjusted pricetoearnings ratio ie cape the ratio of company assets to their replacement cost ie tobin’s q or nonfinancial market capitalizationtogross domestic product are among their highest levels in history each is flashing serious warning signals and each correlates strongly with future returns   in light of the aforementioned one would expect investment professionals to be cautioning clients about the risk of a bear market in us equities why then are the vast majority screaming “you can’t fight the fed” and telling clients that valuations are reasonable the answer likely resides in selfinterest and career risk as keynes noted “worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally” additionally there is the selfinterest of the mutual fund industry which collects enormous fees from the equity funds it manages simply put their chief strategists are loathe to suggest significant reductions in client equity allocations and they likely wouldn’t have their jobs very long if they did as a result the investment industry’s response to each of the last two bear markets has essentially been “who could have known you can’t time the markets” while not an advocate of market timing the great ben graham noted that there are valuation levels as which investors “certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell” today if you aren’t concerned about valuations you aren’t looking at the right metrics or simply don’t care to acknowledge them those that correlate strongly with longterm returns are at levels that in each and every instance have been followed by bear markets there are no valuation metrics that we know of that correlate well with returns over the subsequent  months yet market internals have deteriorated measurably this year nearly half of the stocks in the nasdaq composite are down  from their week highs with the average stock in the index down  simply put the benchmark’s solid yeartodate return is a function of the performance of a rather small number of its largest components similarly about  of the stocks in the russell  are down at least  given the significant deterioration in market internals coupled with the excessive valuation exhibited by metrics that correlate well with longterm returns prudent investors should aggressively reduce their exposure to us equity markets doing so will enable them to preserve capital and deploy additional money into equity markets when risk is far lower and potential returns much higher   continue reading advisor behavior and performance on thursday  february  posted in blog from wall street journal february   wall street journal barclays advisers new performance metric their behavior bank could dock compensation in us wealthmanagement unit for misconduct by  corrie driebusch  updated feb    pm et the new pay model is part of barclayss broad effort to clean its image associated press barclays barcln  plc is shaking up the way it pays its us financial advisers breaking with industry practice as the british bank seeks to clean up its image advisers at the barclays wealth  investment management division in the americas will no longer get paid solely on how much money they bring in going forward their compensation could be docked for misconduct while the size of any such cuts remains to be seen the new policy already has spurred some of the firms roughly  usbased advisers to look for jobs elsewhere according to recruiters and could make it harder for the firm to find new brokers tom lee who heads the adviser unit defended the compensation model that went into effect jan  saying the firm remains competitive as it rewards talent and continues to pay for performance he called the changes industryleading and an important step toward aligning our remuneration practices with our clients and shareholders the change is a small part of a global reshaping of londonbased barclayss business and practices with the aim of polishing a reputation tainted in recent years by scandals including involvement in efforts to rig benchmark interest rates and improper sales of insurance and other financial products it also follows regulatory and internal criticism of the us wealthmanagement units culture for allegedly putting boosting profits ahead of following rules barclayss adviser network is tiny in comparison with those at big us banks such asmorgan stanley ms  which has more than  advisers and recruiters say they dont expect other brokerages to follow suit but it is still causing something of a buzz in an industry in which advisers typically can—and routinely do—calculate their own pay almost to the penny based on a percentage of the commissions and fees they generate at the largest retail brokerages that payout ranges from around  to  barclays advisers will receive about half of their pay in the form of a monthly payment the other half will be paid out every three months according to people familiar with the new arrangement while both payments will be based on a production formula similar to that at other firms the quarterly payment also takes into account valuesbased criteria that include professional conduct and customer complaints poor performance in these areas could lead to a reduced payout mr lee said the new pay model was well received but andrew parish managing director at axiom consulting group llc says he has fielded calls from at least  barclays advisers in new york los angeles and chicago among other places since they learned of the new arrangement late last year so far none has decided to move elsewhere he said as part of his campaign to improve the barclays image chief executive antony jenkins announced last year that bonuses to employees will be based in part on how they uphold the banks values he said that employees unhappy with the changes could leave barclays added about  usbased financial advisers in its purchase of lehman brothers north american operations in the  financial crisis barclayss chief executive at the time robert diamond set out on an aggressive plan to build up the franchise but the unit has faced costs of increasing regulation and of paying a stable of wellconnected wealth managers in  the us securities and exchange commission said it found cultural deficiencies at barclays wealth as did a subsequent independent report which the bank acknowledged was suppressed by an executive leadership of the wealthmanagement division was later replaced the bank has since presented plans to cut its physical presence across the globe and refocus on key clients since the first quarterly variable payments to us advisers wont be made until april it is unclear exactly how much pay could be affected by the new criteria scott smith an analyst at research firm cerulli associates believes the change could help barclays and wouldnt cause many advisers to flee—if pay is docked only rarely deep pay cuts for anything less than serious misconduct wouldnt make sense mr smith said i dont think anyones going to be docked  of their pay because grandma had a complaint he said —max colchester

investment houses on tuesday  january  posted in blog the large investment firms the ones that advertise and everyone knows well as well as many others pay their advisors a percentage of revenue they have generated from their clients  in addition to a fixed percentage of assets revenues come from commissions product fees transaction fees and revenue sharing agreements and these bias the large firm advisors to place their clients’ wealth in their proprietary investment funds or in funds with clandestine revenue sharing arrangements  because they get paid out of revenue their incentive is to use the high revenue generating products and they’re pressured by management to that end  but no individual firm has a monopoly on the best investment talent  in fact the best investment talent leaves these firms because they can’t stomach the politics   these large firms love to hire exteachers and exmilitary because teachers have a large network of children they’ve gotten to know as well as their parents  teachers are generally liked and trusted so naturally clients will trust them with their wealth  and of course children grow up to become investors too  exmilitary are very diligent in going out and raising money they take orders well and are unquestioning by prior career training  that’s a super fit for the firms that want to push high profit margin funds can it be worse than this  you bet   these advisors that you’ll meet are good looking and tall and come from wealthy families that’s right good looking tall and a superior talent or access to collect clients that’s the wirehouse formula  and it works  none of this however gives them an edge on advising you and managing your money  a few might be smart but not by design  by design they want unquestioning advisors that believe they are best serving their clients while unknowingly using inferior and high profit margin mutual fund products    but the greatest disadvantage of using these firms is they never go to cash in anticipation of a market crash  they can’t because it’s equivalent to dialing down their profits it is calendar year earnings that are the most important focus of these large firms not your long term investment performance  instead they tell their clients “you can’t time the market”  these firms don’t even share the same institutional research with their retail advisors that they share with their institutional clients they have a whole other set of worthless research  and that’s by design as well  first the retail advisor base will have difficulty understanding the institutional research and second you can’t have everyone getting out of the market at the same time  these are big firms with trillions of dollars under management  it’s more profitable for them to treat their more valuable untrusting clients better and use the less valuable trusting clients as a source of liquidity for when the valuable clients want to get out     continue reading gold vs  year us treasury inflation protected securities on friday  may  continue reading investment and insurance advisors wirehouse vs independents and third party custodians on wednesday  january  posted in blog it is best to hire an investment advisor and insurance professional separately   insurance by itself is extremely complicated  you’ll end up with an investment advisor who has to spend a lot of time keeping up with the insurance industry regulations pricing performance and new product bells and whistles you want him focused on markets risks and investments  and you don’t want him dealing with the second regulator when the market is melting down  don’t settle on an advisor who does both  it’s likely heshe will do both poorly   if you find an advisor or insurance professional you like and are comfortable with ask for a referral for the other  they won’t want to take reputational risk by referring someone who’s not competent or has integrity issues visit the finra’s financial industry regulatory authority website to see if the advisor has complaints or been convicted of fraud etc  these advisors can stay in business well beyond their usefulness to society by giving good lawyers lots of business   be aware of the various compensation structures that advisors have  these can be fee only or commissions or both  that’s right many advisors collect both  commissions are bad because of the incentive is not aligned with putting you in the best mutual funds   and be careful many firms say they are fee based only but aren’t  a recent study found that  of a large sample of advisors who said in their marketing materials that they are fee based only actually also collect commissions  these advisors are liars regarding fee based advisors fees are a percentage of assets under management  merrill in  will charge   of the st   for amounts over k up to  and  above that  morgan stanley fees are similar independents charge significantly less than that because they are not sharing the fee with their boss and their boss’s boss and with the firm there’s a large exodus of advisors from these large firm many are going independent as technology and research has become widely available and affordable in the last few years  large firms account for  of private clients down from  ten years ago in short go with a fee based firm that does not collect commissions nor has revenue sharing agreements  a truly fee based advisor can get you in a mutual fund with an upfront load without you having to pay that commission  in this case you don’t pay it and the advisor won’t collect it that’s what fee based only means  by the way you’ll pay that commission if you do it yourself online  finally make sure that the advisor has a third party custodian  you don’t want to invest with future bernie madoffs every other week i read about another advisor absconding with their clients’ lifetime savings  if your money is housed at a third party custodian you won’t be robbed the custodian will send out monthly statements and yearend tax information directly to you  the advisor should only be developing a customized asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and executing transactions to populate that strategy for you  he should not be preparing your monthly statements and yearend tax information he should also be knowledgeable about the investment environment and protect you portfolio from going over the cliff ideally he’ll be moving you to cash before that  that’s what the great investors do continue reading large investment firms risk management and mainstream media on

clients as a source of liquidity for when the valuable clients want to get out   ignore most of what’s on cnbc bloomberg and other media business programs  on these shows the “chief global equity strategist” from merrill or morgan is really a highly paid sales person and he is there to market the firm and enhance the firms trading positions there’s also more than one “chief” at these firms—there’s too many venues and tv show for just one “chief”  never take their free advice it’s really not free understand they are given access to the program’s audience because they spend enormous amount of money on advertising  this access to the millions who watch these programs enable them to drum up interest in specific securities that they want to unload at better prices also the program format is remarkably similar to sports news it is entertainment  the format focuses too much attention on the recent past and the short term  what’s hot and what’s not rather than well thought out long term strategies based on fundamentals and valuation—that’s boring and alienates advertisers who want to drive the investment themes themselves also ignore jim cramer  a recent independent study

breakfast event on thursday i spoke briefly about the qe taper and risk to investors  the owner of a competing financial advisory spoke to group moments later “investors should be in the market at all times” he said this is the worst financial advice i ever heard spoken on friday the dow jones industrial average finally climbed to a new alltime inflation adjusted record  it took  years and the broader indices the sp  and nasdaq aren’t even close so if you had your money in the stock markets before the crash in  you’re likely still not back to breakeven     a bit of history first the  crash was easily anticipated no earnings and enormous valuation the crash of  was less easily anticipated  with mortgage fraud and lehman brother’s solvencyliquidity problems concealed and no insight from policy makers main stream media and banking executives denying that a problem even exists investors complacency can be understood  yet when lehman imploded a sensible response was to get out and if you did you would have saved yourself from a further  fall from  to  sp  i see investing much like poker  when the right hand comes along you can bet it all   the risk with this of course is that if another player calls you and you lose – you’re busted   in investing when you have the opportunistic set of conditions in your favor such as an extreme oversold market condition panic and fear from investors deep discounts in valuations etc these are times to invest more heavily into equities as the risk of loss is outweighed by the potential for reward because the hand you are holding is a strong one  the single biggest mistake that investors make today is they continue to be all in on every hand regardless of market conditions  risk is only a function of how much money you will lose when not if you are wrong  the advisor community too often abdicates the most important aspect of fiduciary duty risk management   if you are allin at market tops you can lose everything on one hand  if you are patient and adjust your risk appetite for the investment environment you’ll do much better in the long run here is my advice  if you haven’t already sell equities and let the cash sit uninvested cash provides ultimate optionality all other investments assume price and liquidity risk continue reading revenge of the mom and pop investors on friday  october  posted in blog by joshua

direct responsibility to pay the subadvisory fee to parametric parametric was founded in  as a global equity manager and is a sub partnership of pimco advisors lp a publicly traded investment

of the seattle society of financial analysts the discussion of the funds investment objectives and policies in the prospectus on p  under the caption growth fund is supplemented as follows the funds fundamental investment objective is longterm capital growth as a secondary objective the fund seeks current investment income to achieve its objective the fund will be passively managed to track the russell  indexr the index the index is comprised of securities of the largest  public companies in the united states equity markets and is capitalization weighted the fund attempts to track the investment results of the index by investing in all  or a statistical sampling of the common stocks that comprise the index unlike other equity funds that seek to outperform stock market averages the fund seeks to track the index to provide a return that matches that of the benchmark however because the fund is also managed to reduce tax liability to the funds shareholders and bears certain expenses not factored into the performance of the index the fund will not track the performance of the index perfectly to the extent the fund tracks the index the fund will not pursue opportunities for total return by investing in companies that are not included in the index parametric believes that this passive portfolio management strategy combined with tax management techniques will provide the best opportunity for the optimal level of after tax total return for the funds shareholders passive portfolio management will limit the funds portfolio turnover rate to the lowest possible level low turnover improves the opportunity for higher aftertax performance because realization of capital gains can be deferred under normal circumstances the fund will invest substantially all of its assets in the common stocks of companies represented in the index the fund may invest in certain shortterm fixedincome securities such as cash equivalents although cash and cash equivalents are normally expected to represent less than  of the funds total assets the fund intends to remain fully invested to the extent practicable in a pool of securities which will duplicate the investment characteristics of the index the fund may also invest in stock and stock index futures contracts and options in order to invest uncommitted cash balances to maintain liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions or to minimize trading costs the funds use of futures and options will be limited by the funds avoidance of tax liability and its low turnover rate the fund may purchase securities on a

covered call and put options and purchase call and put options on any securities in which it may invest or on any securities index composed of securities in which it may invest the writing and purchase of options is a highly specialized activity which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions the use of options to seek to increase total return involves the risk of loss if the subadviser is incorrect in its expectation of fluctuations in securities prices or interest rates the successful use of options for hedging purposes also depends in part on the ability of the subadviser to manage future price fluctuations and the degree of correlation between the options and securities markets if the subadviser is incorrect in its expectation of changes in securities prices or determination of the correlation between the securities indices on which options are written and purchased and the securities in a funds investment portfolio the investment performance of the fund will be less favorable than it would have been in the absence of such options transactions the writing of options will be limited by the funds policy to have a very low portfolio turnover rate futures contracts and options on futures contracts to seek to increase total return or to hedge against changes in interest rates securities prices or currency exchange rates the fund may purchase and sell various kinds of futures contracts and purchase and write call and put options on any of such futures contracts the fund may also enter into closing purchase and sale transactions with respect to any such contracts and options the futures contracts may be based on various securities and securities indices the fund will engage in futures and related options transactions for bona fide hedging purposes as defined in regulations of the commodity futures trading commission or to seek to increase total return to the extent permitted by such regulations the fund may not purchase or sell futures contracts or purchase or sell related options to seek to increase total return except for closing purchase or sale transactions  plast�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th if immediately thereafter the sum of the amount of initial margin deposits and premiums paid on the funds outstanding positions in futures and related options entered into for the purpose of seeking to increase total return would exceed  of the market value of the funds net assets these transactions involve brokerage costs require margin deposits and in the case of contracts and options obligating the fund to purchase securities or currencies require the fund to segregate and maintain cash or liquid assets with a value equal to the amount of the funds obligations while transactions in futures contracts and options on futures may reduce certain risks such transactions themselves entail certain risks thus while the fund may benefit from the use of futures and options on futures unanticipated changes in securities prices may result in poorer overall performance than if the fund had not entered into any futures contracts or options transactions because perfect correlation between a futures position and portfolio position that is intended to be protected is impossible to achieve the desired protection may not be obtained and the fund may be exposed to risk of loss the loss incurred by the fund in entering into futures contracts and in writing call options on futures is potentially unlimited and may exceed the amount of the premium received futures markets are highly volatile and the use of futures may increase the volatility of the funds net asset value the profitability of a funds trading in futures to seek to increase total return depends upon the ability of the subadviser to correctly analyze the futures markets in addition because of the low margin deposits normally required in futures trading a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in substantial losses to the fund further futures contracts and options on futures may be illiquid and exchanges may limit fluctuations in futures

us as the air we breathe between both old and young from personal users to businesses and now even hospitals mobile phones have become an essential part of the modern eco system without one people have difficulty finding employment and leave themselves negatively exposed to emergencies the vast majority of american adults    now own a cell phone this has resulted in the massive growth of businesses supplying and supplementing this market of which itll is now becoming a key player the otcqb is an elite tier of the over the counter markets these are companies that have audited financials available are current in their reporting have verified management and shareholders and additional disclosure requirements to meet all in all this signifies that itll is on the ball and doing business the right way morningstar rates otcitll at an excellent  stars meaning it is of fair value the rating is determined by three factors a stocks current price morningstars estimate of the stocks fair value and the uncertainty rating of the fair value the bigger the discount the higher the star rating once again an excellent omen for savvy investorsbreaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements with such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat this is where otc itll comes into play their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space since itll is a public company we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry we’ve done some digging and have laid out  reasons why we believe itll may be the most profitable stock play of  breaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time theyre so common in fact we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations month after month for example in  alone weve already seen several major acquisitions telecom service provider gtt communications announced in june that it plans to buy network connectivity provider global capacity for  million in cash and  million shares of gtt common stock we also saw that in april windstream announced its plan to acquire cloudbased unified communications provider broadview networks in an allcash transaction worth  million and if that isnt enough in march zayo group holdings inc closed its  billion acquisition of electric lightwave the company formerly known as integra telecom all of this happened in just the last few monthsall this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether itll has what it takes to dance with the big guys well it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model big companies like verizon are making money hand over fist  why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usualitll has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive a similar situation took place in canada some years ago when a company named wind mobile came into play over a few short years wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition recently shaw bought them out for  billion as a result of all this our opinion of the itll business model is excellent  weve seen this business model work before  if you’ve missed putting this on your stock tracker take a moment and do it right now for more

our website americantechreportcom and in newsletters text message alerts audio services live interviews featured “research” reports on message boards and in email communications for specific time periods that are agreed upon between us and the profiled issuer and  or third party paying us our publication of the information is known as a “campaign” this information may be sent to potential investors at different times that are minutes hours days or even weeks apart typically the trading volume and price of a profiled issuer’s securities increases after the information is provided to the first group of investors therefore the later an investor receives the information the more likely it is that he will suffer trading losses if they purchase the securities of a profiled issuer late in a campaign we are paid to advertise the profiled issuers intelligent cloud resources inc american tech report has been hired by a third party golden island investments ltd for a period beginning on

transfers over this period we will update any changes to our compensation we own zero shares of itll third parties paying us to market the profiled issuer we believe intend to sell their shares they hold while we tell investors to purchase during the campaign intelligent cloud resources inc is a penny stock that was illiquid little to no trading volume prior to our campaign and therefore these securities are subject to wide fluctuations in trading price and volume during the campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each profile issuer will likely increase significantly because of the media exposure when the campaign ends the volume and price of the profiled issuer will likely decrease dramatically as a result investors who purchase during the campaign and hold

content of and do not verify the information that the profiled issuers andor third party service providers publish these third party service providers are likely compensated for providing positive information about the issuer and may fail to disclose their compensation to you if a profiled issuer is a sec reporting company it could be delinquent not current in its periodic reporting obligations ie in its quarterly and annual reports or if it is an otc markets pink sheet quoted company it may be delinquent in its pink sheet reporting obligations which may result in otc markets posting a negative legend pertaining to the profiled issuer at wwwotcmarketscom as follows i “limited information” for companies with financial reporting problems economic distress or that are unwilling to file required reports with the pink sheets ii “no information” which characterizes companies that are unable or unwilling to provide any disclosure to the public markets to the sec or the pink sheets and
