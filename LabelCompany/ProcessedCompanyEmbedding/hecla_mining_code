input errors contained under “item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial liquidity and capital resources” in the last full paragraph on page  that paragraph is amended and restated as follows with changes appearing in the last three sentences only   original disclosure   amended and restated disclosure cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of  increased by  million compared to the same period in  the increase was primarily due to working capital and other operating asset and liability changes which resulted in a net cash flow increase of  million in the first three months of  compared to a net decrease in cash flows of  million in the  period the  million variance in working capital changes is attributed to lower accounts receivable due to the timing of sales at greens creek and casa berardi and higher payroll accruals due to the timing of payment of incentive compensation related to prior year performance in addition income as adjusted for noncash items was higher by  million due primarily to higher metals prices   cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of  increased by  million

form q in this amendment however there have been no changes to the text of such item other than the changes described above and reflected in the paragraph under the heading “amended and restated disclosure”   this amendment amends only the item of the form q specified above and amends that item solely to reflect the changes described above  this amendment does not reflect events occurring after may     item     managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   certain statements contained in this form q including in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided for under section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  our forwardlooking statements include our current expectations and projections about future results performance results of litigation prospects and opportunities including reserves and other mineralization we have tried to identify these forwardlooking statements by using words such as “may” “will” “expect” “anticipate” “believe” “intend” “feel” “plan” “estimate” “project” “forecast” and similar expressions  these forwardlooking statements are based on information currently available to us and are expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis  however our forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results performance prospects or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements   these risks uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to those set forth under part i item a – business – risk factors in our annual report filed on form k for the year ended december   given these risks and uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forwardlooking statements  all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to hecla mining company or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements  except as required by federal securities laws we do not intend to update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise          overview   hecla mining company and our subsidiaries have provided precious and base metals to the us and worldwide since  we discover acquire develop and produce silver gold lead and zinc   we produce lead zinc and bulk concentrates which we sell to custom smelters and brokers and unrefined precipitate and bullion bars doré containing gold and silver which are further refined before sale to precious metals traders  we are organized into four segments that encompass our operating and development units  greens creek lucky friday casa berardi and san sebastian the map below shows the locations of our operating units and our exploration and predevelopment projects as well as our corporate offices located in coeur dalene idaho and vancouver british columbia     click to enlarge   our current business strategy is to focus our financial and human resources in the following areas     • operating our properties safely in an environmentally responsible manner and costeffectively   • continue optimizing and improving operations at our greens creek lucky friday casa berardi and san sebastian units   • expanding our proven and probable reserves and production capacity at our operating properties   • conducting our business with financial stewardship to preserve our financial position in varying metals price environments   • advance permitting of the rock creek and montanore projects we acquired rock creek as part of the acquisition of revett mining company inc revett in june  and we acquired montanore through the acquisition of mines management inc mines management in september    • maintaining and investing in exploration and predevelopment projects in the vicinities of six mining districts and projects we believe to be underexplored and underinvested north idahos silver valley in the historic coeur dalene mining district our greens creek unit on alaskas admiralty island located near juneau the silverproducing district near durango mexico the abitibi region of northwestern quebec canada the rock creek and montanore projects in northwestern montana and the creede district of southwestern colorado and   • continuing to seek opportunities to acquire and invest in mining properties and companies            a number of key factors may impact the execution of our strategy including regulatory issues and metals prices metals prices can be very volatile as discussed in the critical accounting estimates section below metals prices are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control average market prices of silver gold lead and zinc in the first three months of  were higher than their levels from the comparable period last year as illustrated by the table in results of operations below while we believe current global economic and industrial trends could result in continued demand for the metals we produce prices have been volatile and there can be no assurance that current prices will continue   the total principal amount of our senior notes due may   is  million and they bear interest at a rate of  per year the net proceeds from the senior notes were primarily used for the acquisition of aurizon in june  see note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited  as discussed in the financial liquidity and capital resources section below we believe that we will be able to meet the obligations associated with the senior notes however a number of factors could impact our ability to meet the debt obligations and fund our other projects   on june   we completed the acquisition of revett giving us  ownership of the rock creek project a significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit in northwestern montana in addition on september   we completed the acquisition of mines management giving us  ownership of the montanore project another significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit located approximately  miles from our rock creek project development of rock creek and montanore has been challenged by conservation groups at various times and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permitting required to develop these project s in part i item a risk factors in our annual report filed on form k for the year ended december   see legal challenges could prevent the rock creek or montanore projects from ever being developed for more information   as further discussed in the lucky friday segment section below the union employees at lucky friday have been on strike since march   and production at lucky friday has been suspended since that time we cannot predict how long the strike will last or whether an agreement will be reached as a result of the strike or other related events operations at lucky friday could continue to be disrupted which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations   during the third quarter of  we made a development decision to mine near surface high grade portions of silver and gold deposits at our san sebastian project in mexico ore production commenced in the fourth quarter of  and has continued since that time  in addition work began in the first quarter of  to develop and rehabilitate underground access which would allow us to mine deeper portions of the deposits at san sebastian see the san sebastian segment section below for more information we have generated positive cash flows at san sebastian since the start of production there and we believe that will continue through   however our ability to generate positive cash flows at san sebastian may be impacted by changes in estimated costs precious metals prices or other factors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and operate san sebastian as anticipated   we strive to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance we seek to implement this goal by training employees in safe work practices establishing following and improving safety standards investigating accidents incidents and losses to avoid recurrence involving employees in the establishment of safety standards and participating in the national mining associations coresafety program we attempt to implement reasonable best practices with respect to mine safety and emergency preparedness we work with the mine safety and health administration msha to address issues outlined in its investigations and inspections and continue to evaluate our safety practices   another challenge for us is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities as described in part i item a risk factors of our annual report filed on form k for the year ended december   and note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities and our ability to estimate liabilities in general may change in the future affecting our strategic plans  we are involved in various environmental legal matters and the estimate of our environmental liabilities liquidity needs or strategic plans may be significantly impacted as a result of these matters or new matters that may arise we strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and attempt to resolve environmental litigation on as favorable terms as possible          results of operations   sales of products by metal for the threemonth periods ended march   and  were as follows       three months ended march    in thousands           silver             gold               lead               zinc               less smelter and refining charges             sales of products                 for the first quarter of  we recorded income applicable to common stockholders of  million  per basic common share compared to a loss of  million  per basic common share during the first quarter of  the following factors contributed to the results for the first three months of  compared to the same period in      • an income tax benefit of  million in first quarter of  compared to an income tax provision of  million in the first quarter of  the benefit in the  period is primarily the result of a change in income tax position relating to the timing of deduction for  shaft development costs at lucky friday as further discussed in corporate matters below   • higher average silver gold lead and zinc prices for the first quarter of  compared to the same period in          three months ended march                  silver – london pm fix ounce               realized price per ounce

          realized price per pound                 average realized prices differ from average market prices primarily because concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement which differ from average market prices  due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with customers we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled  previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metal prices each period through final settlement  for the first quarter of  we recorded net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of  million compared to net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of  million in the first quarter of  the price adjustments related to silver gold zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments were largely offset by gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each period see note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited for more information  the gains and losses on these contracts are included in revenues and impact the realized prices for silver gold lead and zinc  realized prices are calculated by dividing gross revenues for each metal which include the price adjustments and gains and losses on the forward contracts discussed above by the payable quantities of each metal included in concentrate and doré shipped during the period            • a net foreign exchange loss in the first quarter of  of  million versus a net loss of  million in the same period of  with the variance primarily related to the impact of smaller decreases in the cadtousd exchange rate on the remeasurement of our net monetary liabilities in quebec during the first quarter of  the applicable cadtousd exchange rate decreased from  to  compared to a decrease in the rate from  to  during the first quarter of    • increased gross profit at our greens creek and lucky friday units in the first quarter of  of  million and  million respectively compared to the first quarter of  this was partially offset by decreases in gross profit of  million and  million respectively in the first quarter of  at our casa berardi and san sebastian units see the greens creek segment the lucky friday segment the casa berardi segment and the san sebastian segment sections below   • unrealized gains on investments of  million in the first quarter of  compared to losses of  million in the first quarter of  the losses in  were the result of impairments of certain investments being deemed to be otherthantemporary   • exploration and predevelopment expense increased by  million in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  in  we have continued exploration work at our greens creek san sebastian and casa berardi units and at our other projects in quebec canada predevelopment expense is defined as costs incurred in the exploration stage that may ultimately benefit production such as underground ramp development which are expensed due to the lack of proven and probable reserves predevelopment expense of  million in the first quarter of  was related to advancement of our montanore and rock creek projects   • higher interest expense by  million in the first quarter of  compared to the same period of  interest expense in the first quarters of  and  was net of  million and  million respectively in capitalized interest primarily related to the  shaft project with the decrease due to completion of  shaft in january    • a

and cash cost after byproduct credits nongaap and allin sustaining cost before byproduct credits and allin sustaining cost after byproduct credits nongaap    the  million increase in gross profit during the first quarter of  compared to the same  period was the result of higher average prices for silver gold zinc and lead impacting sales by approximately  million these factors were partially offset by lower sales volume due to the timing of shipments and decreased ore production grades and mill recoveries in addition gross profit at greens creek was impacted by positive price adjustments to revenues of  million for the first quarter of  compared to positive price adjustments of  million for the first quarter of  price adjustments to revenues result from changes in metals prices between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlements during the period  the price adjustments related to silver gold zinc and lead contained in concentrate shipments were net of gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each period the price adjustments and gains and losses on forward contracts discussed above are included in sales   mining costs per ton increased by  in the first quarter of  compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of higher labor cost due to higher staffing levels higher fuel and power costs and lower milled tons milling costs per ton increased  in the first quarter of  compared to the same period in  due to lower tons milled and higher power and reagents costs partially offset by lower labor costs the increase in cost of hydroelectric power is the result of a price increase per kilowatthour purchased from  to  in september           the chart below illustrates the factors contributing to the

aisc before byproduct credits per silver ounce             byproduct credits             aisc after byproduct credits per silver ounce                 the decrease in cash costs after byproduct credits per silver ounce for the first quarter of  compared to  was the result of higher byproduct credits partially offset by lower silver production the decrease in aisc after byproduct credits per silver ounce was due to the same factors impacting cash costs after byproduct credits per silver ounce along with lower capital and exploration spending          mining and milling costs per ounce increased in the first quarter of  compared to  on a perounce basis due primarily to lower silver production resulting from lower silver grades and ore throughput   other cash costs per ounce for the first quarter of  were higher compared to  due to the effect of lower silver production   treatment costs were higher in the first quarter of  compared to  as a result of lower silver production and higher silver prices as treatment costs include the value of silver not payable to us through the smelting process the silver not payable to us is either recovered by the smelters through further processing or ultimately not recovered and included in the smelters’ waste material   byproduct credits per ounce were higher in the first quarter of  compared to  due to higher gold zinc and lead prices and lower silver production        the difference between what we report as “production” and “payable metal quantities sold” is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts  differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules or variances in ore grades which impact the amount of metals contained in concentrates produced and sold  the difference in payable quantities sold for  compared to  is due mainly to timing of concentrate shipments   while revenue from zinc lead and gold byproducts is significant we believe that identification of silver as the primary product of the greens creek unit is appropriate because     • silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future   • we have historically presented greens creek as a producer primarily of silver based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year   • metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery   • the greens creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver and   • in most of its working areas greens creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery   likewise we believe the identification of gold lead and zinc as byproduct credits is appropriate because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is the primary product we intend to produce in addition we have not consistently received sufficient revenue from any single byproduct metal to warrant classification of such as a coproduct   we periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and byproducts is appropriate  because we consider zinc lead and gold to be byproducts of our silver production the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations of cash cost after byproduct credits per silver ounce and aisc after byproduct credits per silver ounce               the lucky friday segment

of  compared to  the variance is primarily due to higher silver lead and zinc prices partially offset by reduced metal production as a result of the suspension of operations starting in midmarch  due to a strike by unionized employees discussed further below silver and lead production was also impacted by lower ore grades   mining and milling cost per ton increased by  and  respectively in the

the decrease in aisc after byproduct credits per silver ounce is due to the same factors impacting cash cost after byproduct credits per silver ounce along with lower capital costs primarily as a result of completion of the  shaft project in january    similar to the greens creek segment the difference between what we report as “production” and “payable metal quantities sold” is due essentially to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts          while value from lead and zinc is significant we believe that identification of silver as the primary product of the lucky friday unit is appropriate because     • silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future   • the lucky friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production and   • the lucky friday unit generally utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production   likewise we believe the identification of lead and zinc as byproduct credits is appropriate because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is the primary product we intend to produce in addition we do not receive sufficient revenue from any single byproduct metal to warrant classification of such as a coproduct   we periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and byproducts is appropriate  because we consider zinc and lead to be byproducts of our silver production the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations of cash cost after byproduct credits per silver ounce and aisc after byproduct credits per silver ounce   many of the employees at our lucky friday unit are represented by a union and the most recent collective bargaining agreement with the union expired on april   on february   the unionized employees voted against our contract offer on march   the unionized employees went on strike and have been on strike since that time production at the lucky friday has been suspended since start of the strike costs related to careandmaintenance of the mine during the strike period are reported in a separate line item on our condensed

resulting from the additional costs related to the east mine crown pillar emcp pit including ongoing stripping costs and lower ore grades partially offset by higher gold prices and ore production processing of ore from the emcp pit began in july  resulting in increased ore volume but at a lower grade   mining and milling cost per ton for the first quarter of  were lower than the first quarter of  by  and  respectively primarily due to higher ore production this was partially offset by foreign exchange differences as the us dollar was weaker relative to the canadian dollar in the first

a result of addition of production from the emcp pit partially offset by higher gold production the decrease in aisc after byproduct credits per gold ounce was due to lower capital spending and higher gold production partially offset by higher production costs   the difference between what we report as production and payable metal quantities sold is mainly attributable to inventory changes incidental to the timing of sales of refined metals and shipping schedules   we believe the identification of silver as a byproduct credit is appropriate at casa berardi because of its lower economic value compared to gold and due to the fact that gold is the primary product we intend to produce there in addition we do not receive sufficient revenue from silver at casa berardi to warrant

the difference between what we report as production and payable metal quantities sold is mainly attributable to inventory changes incidental to the timing of sales of refined metals and shipping schedules   we believe the identification of gold as a byproduct credit is appropriate at san sebastian because of its anticipated lower economic value compared to silver over the life of the mine in addition we will not receive sufficient revenue from gold at san sebastian to warrant classification of such as a coproduct because we consider gold to be a byproduct of our silver production at san sebastian the value of gold offsets operating costs within our calculations of cash cost after byproduct credits per silver ounce and aisc after byproduct credits per silver ounce in addition to the impact of the byproduct credits from gold cash cost after byproduct credits per silver ounce and aisc after byproduct credits per silver ounce at san sebastian are lower compared to our other operations due to the orebody being near surface and having higher precious metal grades resulting in a lower cash cost before byproduct credits per silver ounce and aisc after byproduct credits per silver ounce          in the first quarter of  we began construction of a new underground ramp and rehabilitation of the historical underground access once completed these underground accesses should

total approximately  million     corporate matters   employee benefit plans   our defined benefit pension plans while affording a significant benefit to our employees also represent a significant liability to us the liability recorded for the funded status of our plans was  million and  million as of march   and december   respectively in april  we contributed  million in cash to our defined benefits plans and expect to contribute an additional  million in cash or shares of our common stock to our defined benefit plans in  while the economic variables which will determine future funding requirements are uncertain we expect contributions to continue to be required in future years under current plan provisions and we periodically examine the plans for affordability and competitiveness see note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited for more information   income taxes   each reporting period we assess our deferred tax assets utilizing longrange forecasts to provide reasonable assurance that they will be realized through future earnings  we continue to have a net deferred tax asset in the us and a net deferred tax liability in canada   our us net deferred tax asset at march   totaled  million or  of total assets an increase of  million from the  million net deferred tax asset at december   the largest component of the deferred tax asset is net operating loss carryforwards the next largest component is deferred foreign exchange losses we have previously determined that we are an indefinite amt taxpayer resulting in additional valuation allowance primarily related to forecasted utilization of regular net operating loss carryforwards and the effect of remeasuring temporary deferred tax assets using a tax rate of  which differed from the previous rate of  during the fourth quarter of  we determined that we are eligible to take a different income tax position relating to the timing of deductions for  shaft development costs at lucky friday we filed with the internal revenue service irs a request for approval to use this method which was approved in the first quarter of  the change resulted in additional deductions of approximately  million and  million for regular tax and amt respectively resulting in a current tax benefit of approximately  million for the reduction in  amt payable in addition this change in tax position substantially changes the timing of additional deductions for these costs for regular tax and amt relative to our projected life of mine and projected taxable income these timing changes caused us to change our assessment of the ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets resulting in a valuation allowance decrease and deferred tax benefit of approximately  million in the first quarter of  at march   we retained a valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets of approximately  million primarily for net operating loss carryforwards   our net canadian deferred tax liability at march   was  million a decrease of  million from the  million net deferred tax liability at december   the deferred tax liability is primarily related to the excess of the carrying value of the mineral resource assets over the tax bases of those assets for canadian tax reporting   we had no mexican deferred tax asset or liability at march   or december   we expect to have unremitted earnings in mexico by the end  however we anticipate being able to fully offset any us tax impact of repatriating any mexican earnings with foreign tax credits that are available to use for both regular tax and amt accordingly we estimate the net us income tax impact of unremitted earnings to be zero a  million valuation allowance remains on deferred tax assets in

after byproduct credits aisc before byproduct credits and aisc after byproduct credits for our operations at the greens creek lucky friday san sebastian and casa berardi units and for the company for the threemonth periods ended march   and    cash cost after byproduct credits per ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize to measure each mines operating performance we have recently started reporting aisc after byproduct credits per ounce which we use as a measure of our mines net cash flow after costs for exploration predevelopment reclamation and sustaining capital this is similar to the cash cost after byproduct credits per ounce nongaap measure we report but also includes onsite exploration reclamation and sustaining capital costs current gaap measures used in the mining industry such as cost of goods sold do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover develop and sustain silver and gold production cash cost after byproduct credits per ounce and aisc after byproduct credits per ounce also allow us to benchmark the performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors as a primary silver mining company we also use these statistics on an aggregate basis  aggregating the greens creek lucky friday and san sebastian mines  to compare our performance with that of other primary silver mining companies with regard to casa berardi we use cash cost after byproduct credits per gold ounce and aisc after byproduct credits per gold ounce to compare its performance with other gold mines similarly these statistics are useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as they provide a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic metallurgical and operating characteristics   cash cost before byproduct credits and aisc before byproduct credits include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals including mining processing and other plant costs thirdparty refining expense onsite general and administrative costs royalties and mining production taxes aisc before byproduct credits for each mine also includes onsite exploration reclamation and sustaining capital costs aisc before byproduct credits for our consolidated silver properties also includes corporate costs for general and administrative expense exploration and sustaining capital projects byproduct credits include revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit as depicted in the tables below byproduct credits comprise an essential element of our silver unit cost structure distinguishing our silver operations due to the polymetallic nature of their orebodies cash cost after byproduct credits per ounce and aisc after byproduct credits per ounce provide management and investors an indication of operating cash flow after consideration of the average price received from production we also use these measurements for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations periodtoperiod from a cash flow perspective cash cost after byproduct credits per ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies including the silver institute in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes there can be no assurance however that these nongaap measures as we report them are the same as those reported by other mining companies   the casa berardi section below reports cash cost after byproduct credits per gold ounce and aisc after byproduct credits per gold

acquisitions of other mining companies or properties regulatory matters litigation potential repurchases of our common stock under the program described above and payment of dividends on common stock if declared by our board of directors  capital expenditures are closely tied to operations and because mining at lucky friday has halted due to the strike and we cannot predict how long the strike will last we currently do not have an estimate of capital expenditures for the full year of  we incurred  million in capital expenditures in the first three months of march    we estimate that exploration and predevelopment expenditures will total between  million and  million in  including  million already incurred as of march   however capital exploration and predevelopment expenditures may change based upon our financial position metals prices and other considerations our ability to fund the activities described above will depend on our operating performance metals prices our ability to estimate costs sources of liquidity available to us and other factors a sustained downturn in metals prices or significant increase in operational or capital costs other uses of cash or

activities in the first quarter of  increased by  million compared to the same period in  the increase was primarily due to working capital and other operating asset and liability changes which resulted in a net cash flow decrease of  million in the first three months of  compared to a net decrease in cash flows of  million in the  period   the  million variance in working capital changes is attributed to lower accounts receivable due to the timing of sales at greens creek and casa berardi and higher payroll accruals due to the timing of payment of incentive compensation related to prior

qualifying retired employees along with a supplemental executive retirement plan these amounts represent our estimate of the future funding requirements for these plans  we believe we will have funding requirements related to our defined benefit plans beyond one year however such obligations are not fixed in nature and are difficult to estimate as they involve significant assumptions see note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited for more information      on april   we completed an offering of  million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due may   the senior notes bear interest at a rate of  per year from the date of original issuance or from the most recent payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for  interest on the senior notes is payable on may  and november  of each year commencing november   and we have made all interest payments payable to date since the initial offering we have issued an additional  million in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes to fund obligations under our defined benefit pension plan see note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited for more information   we record liabilities for costs associated with mine closure reclamation of land and other environmental matters  at march   our liabilities for these matters totaled  million future expenditures related to closure reclamation and environmental expenditures at our sites are difficult to estimate although we anticipate we will incur expenditures relating to these obligations over the next  years for additional information relating to our environmental obligations see note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited      offbalance sheet arrangements   at march   we had no existing offbalance sheet arrangements as defined under sec regulations that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors          critical accounting estimates   our significant accounting policies are described in note  of notes to consolidated financial statements in our annual report filed on form k for the year ended december    as described in note  of the annual report we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets liabilities revenue and expenses our estimates are based on our experience and our interpretation of economic political regulatory and other factors that affect our business prospects actual results may differ significantly from our estimates   we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices obligations for environmental reclamation and closure matters mineral reserves and accounting for business combinations as they require us to make assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates were made and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed to be critical however changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements   future metals prices   metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our significant assets and liabilities including properties plants and equipment deferred tax assets and certain accounts receivable metals prices are also an important component in the estimation of reserves  as shown under item a  risk factors in our annual report filed on form k for the year ended december   metals prices have historically been volatile silver demand arises from investment demand particularly in exchangetraded funds industrial demand and consumer demand gold demand arises primarily from investment and consumer demand  investment demand for silver and gold is influenced by various factors including  the value of the us dollar and other currencies changing us budget deficits widening availability of exchangetraded funds interest rate levels the health of credit markets and inflationary expectations  uncertainty related to the political environment in the us britains exit from the european union and a global economic recovery including recent uncertainty in china could result in continued investment demand for precious metals  industrial demand for silver is closely linked to world gross domestic product growth and industrial fabrication levels as it is difficult to substitute for silver in industrial fabrication  consumer demand is driven significantly by demand for jewelry and other retail products we believe that longterm industrial and economic trends including urbanization and growth of the middle class in countries such as china and india will result in continued consumer demand for silver and gold and industrial demand for silver  however china has recently experienced a lower rate of economic growth which could continue in the near term there can be no assurance whether these trends will continue or how they will impact prices of the metals we produce in the past we have recorded impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices and we can offer no assurance that prices will either remain at their current levels or increase    processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly affected by prices include analysis of asset carrying values depreciation reserves and deferred income taxes on at least an annual basis  and more frequently if circumstances warrant  we examine our depreciation rates reserve estimates and the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets we examine the carrying values of our assets as changes in facts and circumstances warrant  in our evaluation of carrying values and deferred taxes we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model including current prices analyst price estimates forwardcurve prices and historical prices see mineral reserves  below regarding prices used for reserve estimates using applicable accounting guidance and our view of metals markets we use the probabilityweighted average of the various methods to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly stated and to determine the level of valuation allowances if any on our deferred tax assets  in addition estimates of future metals prices are used in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions see business combinations below    sales of concentrates sold directly to customers are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer generally at the time of shipment at estimated forward metals prices for the estimated month of settlement due to the time elapsed between the time of shipment of concentrates to the customer and final settlement with the customer we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled previously recorded sales and trade accounts receivable are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the customer changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement result in changes to revenues and accounts receivable previously recorded upon shipment  as a result our trade accounts receivable balances related to concentrate sales are subject to changes in metals prices until final settlement occurs  for more information see part n revenue recognition of note  of notes to consolidated financial statements in our annual report filed on form k for the year ended december              we utilize financiallysettled forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in prices for silver gold zinc and lead  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  commodityprice risk management below for more information on our contract programs  these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore markedtomarket through earnings each period  changes in silver gold zinc and lead prices between the dates that the contracts are entered into and their settlements will result in changes to the fair value asset or liability associated with the contracts with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in earnings   obligations for environmental reclamation and closure matters   accrued reclamation and closure costs can represent a significant and variable liability on our balance sheet we have estimated our liabilities under appropriate accounting guidance and on at least an annual basis  and more frequently if warranted  management reviews our liabilities with our audit committee however the ranges of liability could exceed the liabilities recognized if substantial damages were awarded claims were settled or remediation costs incurred in excess of our accruals our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected   mineral reserves   critical estimates are inherent in the process of determining our reserves our reserves are affected largely by our assessment of future metals prices as well as by engineering and geological estimates of ore grade accessibility and production cost metals prices are estimated at longterm averages as described in item   property descriptions in our annual report filed on form k for the year ended december   our assessment of reserves occurs at least annually and periodically utilizes external audits   reserves are a key component in the valuation of our properties plants and equipment reserve estimates are used in determining appropriate rates of unitsofproduction depreciation with net book value of many assets depreciated over remaining estimated reserves reserves are also a key component in forecasts with which we compare future cash flows to current asset values in an effort to ensure that carrying values are reported appropriately our forecasts are also used in determining the level of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets reserves also play a key role in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for acquisitions annual reserve estimates are also used to determine conversions of mineral assets beyond the known reserve resulting from business combinations to depreciable reserves in periods subsequent to the business combinations see business combinations below  reserves are a culmination of many estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of metals or that we will do so at a profitable level   business combinations   we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date  the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to longlived assets including mineral assets beyond the known reserve these include estimates of future metals prices and mineral reserves as discussed above  management may also be required to make estimates related to the valuation of deferred tax assets or liabilities as part of the purchase price allocation for business combinations in some cases we use thirdparty appraisers to determine the fair values and lives of property and other identifiable assets in addition costs related to business combinations are included in earnings as incurred and our financial results for periods in which business combinations are pursued could be adversely affected as a result          item     exhibits   the following exhibits are filed as a part of this report    certification pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley

indication of operating cash flow after consideration of the average price received from production we also use this measurement for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations periodtoperiod from a cash flow perspective cash cost after byproduct credits per ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies including the silver institute in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes there can be no assurance however that our reporting of this nongaap measure is the same as that reported by other mining companies   the casa berardi section below reports cash cost after byproduct credits per gold ounce for the production of gold its primary product and byproduct revenues earned from silver which is a byproduct at casa berardi only costs and ounces produced relating to units with the same primary product are combined to represent cash cost after byproduct credits per ounce thus the gold produced at our casa berardi unit is not included as a byproduct credit when calculating cash cost after byproduct credits per silver ounce for the total of greens creek lucky friday and san sebastian our combined silver properties

silver gold lead and zinc table of contents we produce lead zinc and bulk concentrates which we sell to custom smelters and brokers and unrefined precipitate and bullion bars dore containing gold and silver which are further refined before sale to precious metals traders we are organized into four segments that encompass our operating and development units greens creek lucky friday casa berardi and san sebastian the map below shows the locations of our operating units and our exploration and predevelopment projects as well as our corporate offices located in coeur dalene idaho and vancouver british columbia image removed our current business strategy is to focus our financial and human resources in the following areas operating our properties safely in an environmentally responsible manner and costeffectively continue optimizing and improving operations at our greens creek lucky friday casa berardi and san sebastian units expanding our proven and probable reserves and production capacity at our operating properties conducting our business with financial stewardship to preserve our financial position in varying metals price environments advance permitting of the rock creek and montanore projects we acquired rock creek as part of the acquisition of revett mining company inc revett in june  and we acquired montanore through the acquisition of mines management inc mines management in september  maintaining and investing in exploration and predevelopment projects in the vicinities of six mining districts and projects we believe to be underexplored and underinvested north idahos silver valley in the historic coeur dalene mining district our greens creek unit on alaskas admiralty island located near juneau the silverproducing district near durango mexico the abitibi region of northwestern quebec canada the rock creek and montanore projects in northwestern montana and the creede district of southwestern colorado and continuing to seek opportunities to acquire and invest in mining properties and companies a number of key factors may impact the execution of our strategy including regulatory issues and metals prices metals prices can be very volatile as discussed in the critical accounting estimates section below metals prices are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control average market prices of silver gold lead and zinc in the first three months of  were higher than their levels from the comparable period last year as illustrated by the table in results of operations below while we believe current global economic and industrial trends could result in continued demand for the metals we produce prices have been volatile and there can be no assurance that current prices will continue table of contents the total principal amount of our senior notes due may   is  million and they bear interest at a rate of  per year the net proceeds from the senior notes were primarily used for the acquisition of aurizon in june  see note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited as discussed in the financial liquidity and capital resources section below we believe that we will be able to meet the obligations associated with the senior notes however a number of factors could impact our ability to meet the debt obligations and fund our other projects on june   we completed the acquisition of revett giving us  ownership of the rock creek project a significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit in northwestern montana in addition on september   we completed the acquisition of mines management giving us  ownership of the montanore project another significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit located approximately  miles from our rock creek project development of rock creek and montanore has been challenged by conservation groups at various times and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permitting required to develop these projects in part i item a risk factors in our annual report filed on form k for the year ended december   see legal challenges could prevent the rock creek or montanore projects from ever being developed for more information as further discussed in the lucky friday segment section below the union employees at lucky friday have been on strike since march   and production at lucky friday has been suspended since that time we cannot predict how long the strike will last or whether an agreement will be reached as a result of the strike or other related events operations at lucky friday could continue to be disrupted which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations during the third quarter of  we made a development decision to mine near surface high grade portions of silver and gold deposits at our san sebastian project in mexico ore production commenced in the fourth quarter of  and has continued since that time in addition work began in the first quarter of  to develop and rehabilitate underground access which would allow us to mine deeper portions of the deposits at san sebastian see the san sebastian segment section below for more information we have generated positive cash flows at san sebastian since the start of production there and we believe that will continue through  however our ability to generate positive cash flows at san sebastian may be impacted by changes in estimated costs precious metals prices or other factors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and operate san sebastian as anticipated we strive to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance we seek to implement this goal by training employees in safe work practices establishing following and improving safety standards investigating accidents incidents and losses to avoid recurrence involving employees in the establishment of safety standards and participating in the national mining associations coresafety program we attempt to implement reasonable best practices with respect to mine safety and emergency preparedness we work with the mine safety and health administration msha to address issues outlined in its investigations and inspections and continue to evaluate our safety practices another challenge for us is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities as described in part i item a risk factors of our annual report filed on form k for the year ended december   and note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities and our ability to estimate liabilities in general may change in the future affecting our strategic plans we are involved in various environmental legal matters and the estimate of our environmental liabilities liquidity needs or strategic plans may be significantly impacted as a result of these matters or new matters that may arise we strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and attempt to resolve environmental litigation on as favorable terms as possible table of contents results of operations sales of products by metal for the threemonth periods ended march   and  were as follows three months ended march  in thousands   silver     gold   lead   zinc   less smelter and refining charges     sales of products     for the first quarter of  we recorded income applicable to common stockholders of  million  per basic common share compared to a loss of  million  per basic common share during the first quarter of  the following factors contributed to the results for the first three months of  compared to the same period in  an income tax benefit of  million in first quarter of  compared to an income tax provision of  million in the first quarter of  the benefit in the  period is primarily the result of a change in income tax position relating to the timing of deduction for  shaft development costs at lucky

buyer pound     realized price per pound     average realized prices differ from average market prices primarily because concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement which differ from average market prices due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with customers we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metal prices each period through final settlement for the first quarter of  we recorded net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of  million compared to net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of  million in the first quarter of  the price adjustments related to silver gold zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments were largely offset by gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each period see note  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited for more information the gains and losses on these contracts are included in revenues and impact the realized prices for silver gold lead and zinc realized prices are calculated by dividing gross revenues for each metal which include the price adjustments and gains and losses on the forward contracts discussed above by the payable quantities of each metal included in concentrate and dore shipped during the period a net foreign exchange loss in the first quarter of  of  million versus a net loss of  million in the same period of

lead impacting sales by approximately  million these factors were partially offset by lower sales volume due to the timing of shipments and decreased ore production grades and mill recoveries in addition gross profit at greens creek was impacted by positive price adjustments to revenues of  million for the first quarter of  compared to positive price adjustments of  million for the first quarter of  price adjustments to revenues result from changes in metals prices between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlements during the period the price adjustments related to silver gold zinc and lead contained in concentrate shipments were net of gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each period the price adjustments and gains and losses on forward contracts discussed above are included in sales mining costs per ton increased by  in the first quarter of  compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of higher labor cost due to higher staffing levels higher fuel and power costs and lower milled tons milling costs per ton increased  in the first quarter of  compared to the same period in  due to lower tons milled and higher power

first quarter of  compared to  was the result of higher byproduct credits partially offset by lower silver production the decrease in aisc after byproduct credits per silver ounce was due to the same factors impacting cash costs after byproduct credits per silver ounce along with lower capital and exploration spending table of contents mining and milling costs per ounce increased in the first quarter of  compared to  on a perounce basis due primarily to lower silver production resulting from lower silver grades and ore throughput other cash costs per ounce for the first quarter of  were higher compared to  due to the effect of lower silver production treatment costs were higher in the first quarter of  compared to  as a result of lower silver production and higher silver prices as treatment costs include the value of silver not payable to us through the smelting process the silver not payable to us is either recovered by the smelters through further processing or ultimately not recovered and included in the smelters waste material byproduct credits per ounce were higher in the first quarter of  compared to  due to higher gold zinc and lead prices and lower silver production the difference between what we report as production and payable metal quantities sold is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules or variances in ore grades which impact the amount of metals contained in concentrates produced and sold the difference in payable quantities sold for  compared to  is due mainly to timing of concentrate shipments while revenue from zinc lead and gold byproducts is significant we believe that identification of silver as the primary product of the greens creek unit is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future we have historically presented greens creek as a producer primarily of silver based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery the greens creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver and in most of its working areas greens creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery likewise we believe the identification of gold lead and zinc as byproduct credits is appropriate because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is the primary product we intend to produce in addition we have not consistently received sufficient revenue from any single byproduct metal to warrant classification of such as a coproduct we periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and byproducts is appropriate because we consider zinc lead and gold to be byproducts of our silver production the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations of

representing hecla the united states the coeur d’alene indian tribe and the state of idaho with respect to the coeur d’alene basin environmental litigation and related claims have reached an understanding on proposed financial terms to be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement that would contain additional terms yet to be negotiated “determining the financial terms of any settlement of this longstanding litigation is an important step forward in finally resolving this dispute” said mr baker “while the cost is significant we believe the terms are consistent with both our current plans and adding opportunities that will allow hecla to grow further we hope a final settlement can be achieved by the end of the second quarter” on february   the idaho federal district court issued an order giving the parties to the litigation until april   to inform the court of the status of settlement negotiations during this time period the negotiators will work towards finalizing and agreeing to the settlement terms followed by a recommendation for approval to their respective parties if the parties are able to complete terms of settlement it is expected that a consent decree would be lodged followed by a public comment period of  days and a period for responses to those public comments the consent decree would also require approval by the idaho federal district court if the consent decree is entered hecla would make the following payments ·       million of cash and  million of cash or stock  days after entry of the consent decree ·       million of cash  days after the first anniversary of entry of the consent decree ·       million of cash  days after the second anniversary of entry of the consent decree ·       million by august  as quarterly payments of the proceeds from the exercise of any outstanding series  and series  warrants which have an exercise price of between  and  per share during the quarter with the balance of the  million due in august  regardless of the amount of warrants that have been exercised while the negotiators have reached an understanding on proposed financial terms no party has agreed to any of these terms as final nor has any party represented that any of these terms are final or agreed to there can be no assurance that a final settlement will be reached metals prices realized metals prices increased significantly in  compared to  in the fourth quarter and full year realized metals prices exceeded market prices primarily because of provisional price gains of  million in the fourth quarter and  million for the year due largely to increased precious metals prices in the time period between the shipment of concentrate and final settlement                                                   fourth quarter ended

                                    operations overview in spite of higher mine and mill throughput at both greens creek and lucky friday silver production decreased slightly in  due to lower silver ore grades at both operations which was anticipated however production of lead and zinc which are important byproducts increased to record levels in  due to higher grades and ore volumes fourth quarter silver production was higher compared to a year ago mainly due to higher milled tonnage the key drivers for the reduction in total cash cost per ounce of silver yearoveryear are higher metals prices and increased production of gold lead and zinc the increase in the fourth quarter total cash cost per ounce of silver in comparison to the same period in  is due to lower zinc and lead grades

included  million ounces in the fourth quarter in comparison to  million ounces and  million ounces respectively in the same periods in  the decrease in silver production yearoveryear is due to lower silver ore grade the lower silver grade along with the higher zinc and lead ore grades were expected and are due to differences in the sequencing of production according to the mine plan the increase in silver production in the fourth quarter over the same period in  is attributable to higher silver gold lead and zinc grades and recoveries and increased mill throughput the company is working to optimize mill capacity at greens creek and has successfully increased throughput by approximately  since  to  tons per day and will work towards increasing throughput to  tons per day in  total cash

fool answers contact us login search search better buy hecla mining co vs royal gold inc royal gold has proven its mettle and hecla minings incredible recent rally deserves a closer look too neha chamaria nehams apr   at am investors looking for exposure to gold and silver cant possibly go wrong with stocks like hecla mining co nysehland royal gold nasdaqrgld both companies have rapidly climbed the ladder over the years to make it to the top of their sector today hecla is one of the leading silver producers in the us while royal gold is among the worlds largest precious metals streaming and royalty companies heclas stunning recent run up has left investors feeling rich  the stock nearly doubled in just the past year royal gold hasnt fared badly either piling on as much as  in a year as of this writing that gives both stocks a lead over their peers making them compelling buys today but lets take a dive deeper into the two companies and compare mining vs streaming first things first its important to understand the difference in the way royal gold and hecla make money image source getty images hecla owns several mines across north america but primarily operates out of three currently with  million ounces of silver in proven and probable reserves hecla is only slightly behind coeur mining nysecde which had  million ounces in silver reserves as of the end of  as you mightve guessed hecla is in the traditional business of extracting precious metals royal gold on the other hand doesnt own mines it enters into streaming agreements with miners under which it pays them cash up front to support their projects and gets metal streams in return streaming companies usually are paying prices substantially below spot rates for those metals making it a lucrative business royal gold has partnered with some of the biggest miners including barrick gold and goldcorp and boasts a portfolio comprising  operating and  developing mines now that you have a fair idea about their different business models lets get straight to the point the case for royal gold royal gold has several things going right for it it closed its fiscal  which ended on june  with record revenue and strong operating cash flows thanks to higher deliveries from mines like centerra golds mount milligan and barrickgoldcorps pueblo viejo it reported  higher revenue an  jump in earnings per share and record operating cash flows during its last quarter almost confirming its on its way to another record year thats just going to make royal golds operational track record look even better it has grown its revenues and operating cash flows at compounded average rates of  and  respectively during the decade through fiscal  not surprisingly it has rewarded shareholders with  consecutive years of dividend increases  a record hard to match in a commoditized industry id credit managements approach to turning downturns into opportunities for royal golds incredible performance for example management struck several streaming agreements in  and  which are now major contributors to the companys revenue including pueblo viejo teck resources andacollo mine and golden star resources wassa and prestea mines with the company having secured interests in  highpotential developing mines including barricks pascualama investors neednt worry about the growth in royal golds top line in coming years the case for hecla mining much like royal gold hecla is firing on all cylinders with revenues hitting record highs in  backed by record silver production thats not all hecla swung to a big profit last year versus losses in  and expects production to inch even higher this year primarily because of grade upgrades in the precious metals business the higher the ore grade the more valuable the mine another fact worth knowing two of heclas operating mines featured among the worlds  most valuable ore mines in a recent list released by infomines intelligencemine as reported by miningcom not surprisingly hecla is also among the industrys lowestcost producers projecting its byproduct allinsustaining cost aisc to be around  per silver ounce this year thats substantially below coeurs reported aisc of  per ounce of silver for  indeed even pan american silver nasdaqpaas  the worlds secondlargest primary silver producer  was dealing with aisc above the  mark until last year when it brought down its costs dramatically to  per silver ounce topgrade mines low costs rapidly growing production – theres not much more you can ask from a miner to make a strong investment thesis the final lap why hecla wins the matchup between these companies is incredibly tough but my vote goes to hecla for its solid asset base and standing in a highly competitive industry or to put it another way income investors might prefer royal gold and growth investors are more likely to go for hecla neither side would want to ignore hecla after looking at this chart though hl price to cfo per share ttm data by ycharts hecla is hands down a steal at current prices despite its recent run up  neha chamaria has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks

lucky friday mine is a deep underground silver lead and zinc mine located in the coeur d’alene mining district in northern idaho hecla now controls  of the gold hunter deposit also known as the lucky friday expansion area after completing acquisition from independence lead mines company in the th quarter of  the mine is located approximately one mile east of mullan in shoshone county north idaho and  miles east of coeur d’alene idaho along interstate  i the facility lies just north of the interstate near exit ramp  the silver shaft head frame can be easily observed from i with the shaft collar approximately  feet above the valley floor the lucky friday vein system is immediately adjacent to the silver shaft and the gold hunter deposit lies  feet northwest of the silver shaft in  ore was processed at an average rate of  tons per day and produced  million ounces of silver the  shaft project a key growth project is now operational reaching  feet below the surface the  shaft is an important part of lucky friday’s future as it provides access to the highestgrade ore in the mine’s year history and should extend the mine life for  more years in  the focus is on developing the  level to connect the  shaft to the orebody the plant has a full surface facility complete with a  tons of ore per day mill which produces lead and zinc concentrates these concentrates are currently shipped for treatment via truck to teck cominco metals ltd smelter in trail bc canada all production is by underground methods which include both underhand and overhand mining the coarse mill tailing is mixed with cement and used as backfill production is via ramps and transfers and substantially utilizes jumbo drills mechanized mining and truck haulage to the silver shaft access to the underground workings is via the foot diameter concrete lined silver shaft geology  mining there have been two orebearing structures mined at the lucky friday unit the first mined through  was the lucky friday vein a fissure vein typical of many in the coeur d’alene mining district the orebody is located in the revett formation which is known to provide excellent host rocks for a number of orebodies in the coeur d’alene mining district the lucky friday vein strikes northeasterly and dips steeply to the south with an average width of six to seven feet its principal ore minerals are galena and tetrahedrite with minor amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite the ore occurs as a single continuous orebody in and along the lucky friday vein the major part of the orebody has extended from the foot level to and below the foot level the second orebearing structure known as the lucky friday expansion area is located in the wallace formation it has been mined since  pursuant to an operating agreement with silver hunter mining company “silver hunter” our wholly owned subsidiary during  we discovered several mineralized structures containing some highgrade silver ores in an area known as the gold hunter property approximately  feet northwest of the then existing lucky friday workings this discovery led to the development of the gold hunter property on the  level on november   we through silver hunter completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of independence lead mines company “independence” including all future interest or royalty obligations to independence and the mining claims pertaining to the operating agreement with hecla limited that was assigned to silver hunter the principal mining method at the lucky friday unit is ramp access cut and fill this method utilizes rubbertired equipment to access the veins through ramps developed outside of the orebody once a cut is taken along the strike of the vein it is backfilled with cemented tailings and the next cut is accessed either above or below from the ramp system there are three main phases to the mining process development production and backfilling development – the tunneling or accessing phase using plans from the geology and engineering departments miners drive tunnels ft high by ft wide to access the various ore zones to be mined production – the extraction phase the method of extraction depends upon the geological nature of the orebody involved some of the narrower orebodies can be extracted using conventional mining methods slushers and jackleg drills mining as narrow as three feet in other more massive orebodies mechanized mining methods are employed using large rubbertired equipment to mine widths of up to  feet backfilling – the replacement phase the voids created during the production phase are filled up with a combination of mill waste tailings and cement this “backfilling” process stabilizes the production voids and allows extraction of the ore

governed by the sec and included in the sec’s securities act industry guide  entitled “description of property by issuers engaged or to be engaged in significant mining operations” guide  however the company is also a “reporting issuer” under canadian securities laws which require estimates of mineral resources and reserves to be prepared in accordance with canadian national instrument  ni  ni  requires all disclosure of estimates of potential mineral resources and reserves to be disclosed in accordance with its requirements such canadian information is being included here to satisfy the company’s “public disclosure” obligations under regulation fd of the sec and to provide us holders with ready access to information publicly available in canada reporting requirements in the united states for disclosure of mineral properties under guide  and the requirements in canada under ni  standards are substantially different this website contains a summary of certain estimates of the company not only of proven and probable reserves within the meaning of guide  which requires the preparation of a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study demonstrating the economic feasibility of mining and processing the mineralization using the threeyear historical average price for any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and that the primary environmental analysis or report be filed with the appropriate governmental authority but also of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates estimated in accordance with the definitional standards of the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum referred to in ni  the terms “measured resources” “indicated resources” and “inferred resources” are canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with ni  these terms are not defined under guide  and are not normally permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the sec in the united states except where required to be disclosed by foreign law the term “resource” does not equate to the term “reserve” under guide  the material described herein as “indicated resources” and “measured resources” would be characterized as “mineralized material” and is permitted to be disclosed in tonnage and grade only not ounces the category of “inferred resources” is not recognized by guide  investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in such categories will ever be converted into proven or probable reserves “resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of such a “resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher category or will ever be economically extracted investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a “resource” exists or is economically or legally mineable investors are also especially cautioned that the mere fact that such resources may be referred to in ounces of silver andor gold rather than in tons of mineralization and grades of silver andor gold estimated per ton is not an indication that such material will ever result in mined ore which is processed into commercial silver or gold  reserves  resources pdf exploration at lucky friday  tons were milled containing approximately  million ounces of silver during   current reserve tons are  lower than last year and the contained silver ounces decreased by  to  million ounces  the  reductions to reserve tonnages at lucky friday are due to mining depletion and increased production costs  measured and indicated silver resources at lucky friday increased  from  to a total of  million ounces during the fourth quarter of  one drill was operating underground exploration drilling from the  ramp station west was designed to evaluate  vein mineralization west of the second block of the silver fault which is the current western boundary of the resource this drilling was progressively steeper and reached the  sublevel elevation  the shallower holes intersected three distinct veins with the deeper two holes only indicating a singular vein of significance vein interpretations have not been completed future plans our goal is to access more resource to further extend the mine life at lucky friday currently we believe only onethird of the tons and onehalf of the ounces that are contained underground at lucky friday are in the current mine life hecla sees great organic growth opportunities at lucky friday  shaft the  shaft project an internal shaft at the lucky friday mine is now operational and expected to provide deeper access in order to increase the mine’s production and operational life the  shaft project a key growth project reaches  feet below the surface and is an important part of lucky friday’s future as it provides access to the highestgrade ore in the mine’s year history and should extend the mine life for  more years in  the focus is
