energychris faulkner ceo of breitling energy often dubbed in the media as the “frackmaster” because of his staunch support of hydraulic fracturing is warning of panic in the texas oilfields as the oil price plummets he predicts the us fracking boom will end if oil stays in the s and a return to conventional drilling which can be sustained even if the price drops to just  a barrel “it’s looking ugly” he said “it looks like a doublehandle technical pattern with a trading range below  and the bottom now really is only psychological  below we’re into prices not seen since ” he postulates a scenario where we could be headed toward more parity between supply and demand “the latest escalation between saudi arabia and iran dates back a while but has been flared most recently by the iranian sanctions discussions primarily advanced by our president obama these tensions are two fold – iran’s unquenchable thirst to participate in international commerce again including oil flow versus saudi arabia’s intense desire to prevent them “however what is going on is not an “event” it may be a precursor to an event but minus an event i don’t think it’s going to affect oil prices much at this point” “what we do have impending is a reduction in spare capacity the world is consuming about  million barrels of oil per day and supply is ahead of that by about  barrels if the us reduced by  barrels by this spring which i think is very possible then we’ve almost eliminated all the spare which puts us on very thin margin with such tensions building in the middle east “after the fracking revolution took off we grew production in the us by about  barrels per day for three years straight and we’re still producing  million barrels per day but if that drops by  barrels as i expect then we have indeed become the swing producer by default “i’m mostly bullish on oil prices going into  at least back toward  but it will be a slow climb – by midyear perhaps – with the wtibrent spread still tight as it is now” he doesn’t see a lifting on the us export ban affecting things greatly “i just don’t see us exporting a little oil moving the needle on prices or supply all the oil is in the system already now it can just move around more efficiently to the refineries that are ready for it today” “as far as iran’s oil coming to market their only buyer right now is china who has been snatching it at a discount nobody else needs their oil so i don’t think it’s going to have as big an impact as all the gloom and doomers think with the economic news from china that rattled the market recently i don’t see demand increasing any time soon” “the bottom line is the saudiiran conflict could be a flashpoint but until there’s something that affects supply it’s not going to drive oil prices however us production decreases will and the conflict puts us in a position of possibly reading parity between supply and demand and once traders embrace that it very likely could move prices upward “but like we say with gasoline prices – they tend to float up like a feather and drop like a rock we’ve already had oil prices drop like a rock and from a producer’s perspective right now we’d be happy as could be if they’d begin floating up like a feather” view source here httpwwwbreitlingenergycomwpcontentuploadsgasolinepricesforjulyholidaychrisfaulknerepng   breitling energy

energy forum will take place on january  he will join the platts global editorial director of oil dave ernsberger for the first breakout session discussing these new major international developments of  and how they will affect world oil markets “there has been a significant axis shift globally in just a few short days of  i thought we would be discussing the dynamics of  dollar oil and now virtually overnight we have china’s economy crashing and the middle east on the edge of conflict” said faulkner “all of this will have ripple effects and oil has been taking a gut punch this is an amazing time to be in the middle east and speaking to such a prestigious group of colleagues” he said the forum is being hosted by the gulf intelligence a leader in knowledge exchange and networking

forum tradearabiacom the saudi arabiairan conflict will not move the needle on oil prices much gulfnewscom january  in in the press by breitling energythe rising tension among saudi arabia and iran two middle east countries who are major producers of crude oil could push prices down even further amid the prolonged oil glut and uncertainty of their conflict but have remained unchanged so far the persistent oil global surplus remains a significant issue among their squabble as the markets reacted slowly when prices of oil on monday briefly rose higher than  a barrel but withdrew back down to  a barrel on tuesday on sunday saudi arabia declared it would end all their ties with iran oil prices are expected to sink even lower with the lifting of the sanctions imposed on iran since the added supply will only overwhelm an “already oversupplied market” said tony starkey an energy analysis manager for bentek energy the denver based unit of platts an energy and metals data provider the latest tensions between the two countries could change that outlook and have the “potential to stir up violence and conflict that could disrupt oil trade routes and supply which would be bullish for prices” he said the “dustup” between the saudi arabia and iran should not have much of an impact but it has generated doubt said bernard weinstein associate director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university’s cox school of business in dallas “unless those two countries go to war or try to disrupt each other’s oil flow i can’t imagine it will have much of an impact on oil prices down the road” he said prices at gas pumps across the country are averaging  a gallon in many states according to gasbuddycom the lowest price is in missouri where gasoline prices are  a gallon and the highest price is in california at  a gallon the energy information administration the independent statistical arm of the department of energy based in washington dc estimates that gasoline will average  per gallon in  prices could see an even steeper drop if both countries attempt to undermine each other by ramping up and “producing as much oil as they can” weinstein said “obviously the saudis can produce oil at a fiscal loss much longer than the iranians can but i don’t know if they will pursue that strategy or not” he added the outcome in a break in diplomatic relations could be difficult to predict since saudi arabia produces  million barrels a day and is the number one oil producing country with  of the overall global production followed by the us which produces  he said the global surplus of  million to  million excess barrels of oil means consumers will not have to be concerned about prices reversing its course anytime soon “we will have bargain basement gasoline prices for the next couple of years” weinstein said “it’s hard to envision oil rising above  a gallon for the next couple of years” the unease in the middle east will increase volatility in pricing only for the shortterm because of the ambiguity said rob thummel a portfolio manager with tortoise capital in leawood kansas which has  billion under management invested in energy stocks “oil prices are delicate and the margin error is low since there is no geopolitical risk premium built into the price but it depends on how much the conflict escalates” he said with a day supply of crude oil inventories are high and the conflict should “blow over” thummel said the production of oil in the middle east is not impacted even if tensions are higher for a short period if production rises consumers will benefit and see another drop in gasoline prices he said “it will be great for consumers because gasoline prices will remain at  a gallon for a while” thummel said the latest escalation is not an “event” and will not move the needle on prices even if it is a precursor to one said chris faulkner ceo of breitling energy a dallas oil and gas exploration and production company a reduction in the reserves of oil is imminent since the world is consuming about  million barrels of oil per day and the amount of the supply is ahead of that by  barrels he said if the us reduces the amount by  barrels by this spring then we have almost “eliminated all the spare which puts us on very thin margin with such tensions building in the middle east” faulkner said faulkner is “mostly” bullish on oil prices going into  and heading into the  territory although the upswing will be a slow climb and may not occur until the middle of the year with the “wtibrent spread still tight as it is now” he said the bottomline on the saudi arabiairan conflict is that it could wind up being a “flash point but until there’s something that affects supply it’s not going to drive oil prices more than what you saw monday” faulkner said “we like to say with gasoline prices – they tend to float up like a feather and drop like a rock” he said “we’ve already had oil prices drop like a rock and from a producer’s perspective and right now we would be as happy as could be if they would begin floating up like a feather” article author ellen chang  mainstreet view source here

drop in oil prices and other developments in the energy sector like opec policy and its impact on shale drillers is expected to dominate discussions at the th gulf intelligence energy forum in abu

persists in the market the policy of organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec’s to defend its market share and let prices fall in a bid to push highercost rivals such as us shale oil explorers out of the market has proven costly and slow to bear fruits while us output has fallen  from its june peak of  million barrels a day opec members lost about  billion in revenue last year according to the international energy agency iea “the saudi objective to tap down us shale has already had its impact and from here there’s not much more affect they can have — the saudis should accept the fact that is not going to change” said chris faulkner chief executive officer of dallasbased shale driller breitling energy corp “shale has been more than validated and once oil prices go back up to around  output in the us will pick up briskly” added faulkner who will give the  international outlook lecture at the energy forum opec led by saudi arabia did not cut oil production to

price outlook to dominate energy forum gasoline prices to hit sixyear low could dip further as oil glut persists december  in in the press by breitling energythe decline in crude oil prices will persist as the extended global oil glut has pushed them to sixyear lows crude oil prices have not only hit alltime lows in  but the downward pressure continues and could stretch out into  as the issue with the oversupply has not dissipated said chris faulkner ceo of breitling energy a dallas oil and gas exploration and production company “the question i get asked every day is if the prices can go lower and the answer is unequivocally ‘yes’” he said the surplus of crude oil in the market will force gasoline prices to dip even lower and could easily decline by another “ cents or so coming in the very near term” faulkner said the pressure for prices to continue a declining trajectory is strong because refineries must take advantage of the cheap feedstock prices in the market to produce even more gasoline in the next month as prices historically rise in february “refineries shut down temporarily for seasonal maintenance and blends switch over which flush out gasoline overstock and prices begin to rise” he said since current market demands have met their peak gasoline prices will “average less than the  number and remain under  for the yearly average due to continued depressed oil prices” faulkner said “when we look at crude oil prices we think the average remains range bound through april  and we see some increase occurring in the last three quarters with the  average at roughly  a barrel” he said the outlook for oil prices is not favorable as consumption rates are not expected to rise rapidly “we are in a new era of oil prices and should expect oil to remain under  through the end of this decade” faulkner said prices at gas pumps across the country are averaging  a gallon in many states according to gasbuddycom the lowest price is in missouri where gasoline prices are  a gallon running the gamut prices are at  a gallon in texas  in new york and as high as  in hawaii low oil prices will remain as opec producers indicated they would continue their policy of “defending market share” at the last meeting and some of iran’s oil could hit the market as early as mid adding further pressure on prices said timothy hess a lead analyst for the energy information administration the independent statistical arm of the department of energy based in washington dc cheaper gas prices have been a boon to american households who saved  to  this year he said adding to their overall savings consumers who rely on natural gas to heat their homes will pay  less this year compared to last winter as those prices have also declined and warmer weather is predicted the eia estimates that gasoline in the fourth quarter will decline to average  per gallon in december  and  per gallon in  the increase in global oil inventories of  million barrels per day in november added to the downward pressure on north sea brent crude oil prices which was  per barrel in november a  per barrel decrease from october brent crude oil prices will average  per barrel in  and  per barrel in  the eia forecasts the west texas intermediate wti crude oil prices will average  per barrel lower than the brent price in  and  per barrel lower in  production of us crude oil declined by about  per barrels a day in november compared with october the eia said crude oil production is excepted to decrease even more through the third quarter  before growth resumes late in  the continuation of depressed gas prices is an advantage for consumers but the negative impact of oil companies filing for bankruptcies and laying off thousands of employees could soon outweigh the benefits of households increasing their disposable income said bernard weinstein associate director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university’s cox school of business in dallas at least  more companies are predicted to file for bankruptcy in  which trickles down to affect growth in other sectors such a manufacturing construction and housing predicting the bottom of the decline is becoming more difficult as “one of america’s biggest industries in  states is taking it on the chin” he said “the oil and gas industry has twice the impact on economic growth now than it had a decade ago the contraction of the energy sector is retarding economic growth with capital spending down double digit percentages as projects are deferred” the lack of an increase in demand and the extended period of low commodity prices do not make it easy to determine “where the bottom is” weinstein said “a year ago  was the floor and i didn’t think we would see  oil” the surplus in oil is not going away anytime soon he predicts since “america has more oil and gas than we know what to with” “the whole planet is drowning in oil” weinstein added article author ellen chang view full

energy  gasoline prices to hit sixyear low could dip further as oil glut persists oil executive why america should not export its oil now december  in in the press by breitling energycongress has finally put the oil export ban on the table wrapped up in a burrito of porkladen spending that will cost tax payers nearly  trillion and that’s just over the next  months from  million for a new fbi headquarters to tax breaks for racehorses film productions and nascar tracks this bill bellies pork up to new heights however a key component of the bilateral proposal comes at precisely the wrong time congressional republicans well funded by big oil have been looking for the opportunity to slip removing the crude export ban into just the right bill now is not the time to be putting our domestic oil on the international market and we have saudi arabia to thank for showing us so just over a year ago saudi arabia virtually declared war on us shale precipitated from its distaste of losing market share to its abhorrence with president obama’s infatuation with archenemy iran in doing so it admitted american shale had a very high competitive value and wanted to stomp it down or completely tap it out what american lawmakers should be focused on now is taking the gift saudi arabia has given us and turning it into the ultimate political weapon of opecs demise since the cartel was formed in september  in baghdad america has been subject to its increasing influence on world oil prices in  opec as an organization with any kind of influence on world oil prices is dying now america could literally finish it off and in the same stroke establish itself as the new dominant oil power player how it would require political leadership and that seems to be more scarce in washington dc today than a heard of swine here is a plan that would permanently disband opec the united states would join with canada and mexico canada has the world’s thirdlargest oil reserves and create a north american energy federation invite the lesser opec producing members of nigeria angola algeria venezuela and ecuador to join these countries already know that saudi has abandoned them for its own agenda just two days after the last opec meeting nigeria and angola announced their own plan to pursue other producing nations to attempt a production cut to take some supply off the market these nations would be quite vulnerable to break ranks with opec next in nixonesquestyle use wti as the benchmark for the federation and set the price at  federation nations would alienate themselves from imports from saudi kuwait iran iraq qatar and the uae sending those countries scrambling to sell the oil they already have on tankers and in pipes what would happen with this broad stroke is the united states would leverage our shale asset to our own strategic advantage instantly rigs would begin moving again fracking units would mobilize to some of the estimated  wells that have been drilled but not completed jobs in the oilfield would once again come into high demand and thousands of american families could once again enjoy highincome salaries canada’s tar sands would begin production fueling the nowstagnant albertan economy the opec “lesser” nations would instantly double their revenue and potentially avoid likely future credit defaults under current prices while gasoline prices would go up some it would still settle near the inflation adjusted historic average of  per gallon and most importantly opec would be officially dead disbanded and left scrambling to sell its cheap oil into remaining oversaturated markets while the new federation has all the oil it needs at a price everyone could live with once stable then the price control could be relaxed and return to a freemarket trade but on a new supply and demand metric this is a plan that would benefit america strategically and would be the catalyst to finally wean this great nation from the chokehold of foreign oil this is precisely why we should not be selling our oil abroad at this critical time the great concern is how easily congress agreed to excessive spending at a time when fiscal restraint should be paramount to think that there would be such visionary leadership on capitol hill today would be overly optimistic yet we could be so close to true energy independence and all it would take is courage and vision written by chris faulkner ceo and chairman of breitling energy corporation becc based in dallas texas httpwwwbreitlingenergycomwpcontentuploadschrisfaulknerphotooptjpg   breitling energy httpwwwbreitlingenergycomwpcontentuploadsbreitlingenergylogonewpng breitling energy  oil executive why america should not export its oil now faulkner why friday’s opec meeting will be insignificant like opec itself december  in in the press by breitling energyhere is the proposed agenda for friday’s opec meeting in vienna  – convene noon – adjourn  – hold a press conference that’s it oh and probably plenty of forged smiles and photo ops before during and after however if we could somehow peel the curtain back and see the real picture things are not at all as rosy as it may seem i’d give anything to be a waiter at that hour lunch for one the disarray inside the saudi kingdom since king abdullah’s death last january has been widely publicized at least the part that is publicly known cabinet shifts and swooning around the aging and sometimes mentally foggy king salman has created internal chaos up and down erga’s gold and marble lined corridors there’s also the rift between the opec haves and the havenot’s more specifically venezuela ecuador algeria angola nigeria in one corner versus saudi arabia uae qatar and kuwait in the other iran iraq and libya could care less indonesia is the new kid and just glad to be back in the room the lesser opec member nations are on the ropes financially the cashfat nations are draining reserves at unexpected levels but can last years before reaching truly critical levels when they pull into vienna this time they could probably care less it’s on a virtual credit card of sorts speaking of iran the latest defiance appears to be an effort to open up  new projects to foreign ventures with projections of up to one million barrels per day added to the already saturated global crude market it will be interesting to see how many american based companies line up to pounce on those hot prospects as for russia they’re on the sidelines this week at least as far as this discussion goes there will be an official meeting between soviet and opec higher ups but it won’t be until middecember so they continue pumping and competing primarily for european and asian market share many are not expecting any changes to production friday but i think they will actually raise their daily quota to  million barrels taking indonesia’s production into account however as we have seen for the last year it’s basically quotaschmota anyway the number saudi pushed so hard in  to establish has been as elastic as a rubber band although stated at  million barrels per day current opec production approaches  million barrels and once iranian sanctions are lifted that number goes up more just think what oil prices would do if they actually held to the quota which is exactly the point there is no cartel no agreement no enforcement management or group compliance which brings us back to this week’s “meeting” opec is losing their significance faster than their cash saudi has lost control once again iraq is unmanageable and will pump as much as it can iran has made its intentions very clear for next year libya is unpredictable and their volume basically doesn’t really count indonesia is another bit player and their production is already factored into world supply so there’s another nonevent it doesn’t appear venezuela ecuador and the other smaller countries will ever exert enough pressure to sway the shia crescent to hear their futile pleas that leaves us about where we have been for a year now a “cartel” of soon to be thirteen nations that gets together twice a year to smile take pictures enjoy a decadent lunch and then go back home to do whatever they want opec has basically become a social club or perhaps notsosocial club lately until global demand increases or one of the lesser nations tips into insolvency the only other catalyst on the horizon to positively affect oil prices might be more unrest in the region which as we saw over the last two weeks could be one headline away meanwhile oil is likely to retest the august lows where it goes from there is truly anyone’s guess written by chris faulkner breitling energy ceo chairman and author of “the fracking

breitling energy  faulkner why fridays opec meeting will be insignificant like opec itself faulkner backroom politics killed the keystone xl – what the media didn’t report november  in in the press by breitling energysenator john hoeven r nd appeared on fox news last week and in about  seconds chronicled the timeline of the keystone xl pipeline’s demise that hasn’t shown up on any other media to no surprise of this author according to senator hoeven following personal conversations with the canadian government and trans canada the events leading up to the keystone xl pipeline’s demise were strange unethical to say the least if not illegal since it hasn’t shown up anywhere else here is how the senator chronicled the pipeline’s final hours friday october  – the us state department contacted trans canada asking if they would withdraw the contract confused trans canada said no then the state department next asked if they would “pause” the request and send a press release accordingly monday november  – trans canada sent a formal request to the administration to “delay” the ongoing review of the pipeline this was instantly interpreted as kicking the can past the november  election little did anyone know of the conversations three days prior tuesday november  – white house press secretary josh earnest rejected the request to delay saying the president intended to rule on the keystone by the end of his presidency and called transcanada’s request “unusual” midweek – trans canada received an official letter from the white house rejecting the request to delay the review friday november  – president obama in a staged announcement just before noon with vice president biden to his right and secretary kerry on his left announcing that secretary kerry had informed him the year long state department review was now complete and it concluded that the keystone xl pipeline “would not serve the national interest of the united states i agree with that decision” the president said and that’s how the keystone died senator hoeven said the president’s actions were “all political not following the law or the regulation as you’re supposed to do” for the sake of national defense reduced reliance on middle eastern oil and for ongoing relations with our closest ally in the world last week was one of our darkest moments not that the pipeline is completely dead it could quickly revive if we put the right people in place next year but the way this came down was sloppy underhanded obviously manipulated there was certainly no integrity in the maneuverings from either the state department or the white house if the american public knew or cared they would be horrified or perhaps after  years of this many may have become oblivious to the word keystone this was especially revolting because senator hoeven had been talking to both sides in canada and simply repeated what they claimed happened it’s not like he made this up for no reason had the pipeline been approved seven years ago it would be complete and oil would be flowing from canada through north dakota to the gulf coast it would have contributed to our national defense and helped further wean us from saudi’s grip now we will have none of that at least for a while written by chris faulkner breitling energy ceo chairman and author of “the fracking truth america’s energy

faulkner backroom politics killed the keystone xl  what the media didnt report opec’s december meeting will have to address financial woes november  in in the press by breitling energyopec’s dominos keep falling with nary a hint of a budge from the policy that sent oil prices tumbling last year and now opec’s internal discord is at its highest level since  that’s when the member cartel bickered all year before saudi arabia obviously played their strong card forcing their  million barrel per day output plan unfortunately the quota still stands but really it doesn’t because none of the members adhere to it saudi got hit in the face with a brutal slap last week when standard and poor’s downgraded the country’s sovereign debt due to low oil prices judging from saudi’s quick reaction blasting sp for “rushing to judgment” the news apparently came as a surprise and was obviously unwelcome the ripple effect could lead to gradual repricing at lower levels when opec convenes december  in vienna not only will indonesia take a seat at the table but there will likely be more behind the scene scowls rather than smiles this time around considering how each current member nation is lining up it appears to be more of a david and goliath battle between the haves and the havenot’s saudi arabia the united arab emirates qatar and kuwait are all on the side of continuing statusquo obviously allowing the financial chips to fall as they will relying on their mammoth war chests to weather their selfcreated storm iran venezuela nigeria and algeria are all clamoring for a price floor somewhere in the s and a return to a quota more reminiscent of the ’s when a number had more meaning than it does today ecuator angola libya and iraq are quieter about the situation but obviously would relish higher prices and any attempt to take production off the market libya seems to be the only member who periodically contributes to lower production when rebel fighting affects oil fields and ports as it did again this week with the closing of the zueitina port threatening most of its  barrel per day shipments although not an opec member egypt’s financial woes continue as the nation reported burning through  billion of financing it received from its gulf supporters with only  billion remaining in surplus at the current burn rate observers are wondering if an egyptian default could be around the corner and whether its gulf allies can provide more given their own dismal outlooks next enter russia and their new postsoviet high output of nearly  million barrels of oil per day obviously vladimir putin believes the best way to make more money is to oversupply the market not the opposite this is almost like a runaway train to nowhere every man for himself the saudi objective to tap down us shale has already had its impact and from here there’s not much more affect they can have shale has been more than validated and once prices go back up around  output in the us will pick up briskly saudi should accept the fact that is not going to change the best solution if there is a diplomatic one would be for opec and russia to agree to throttle production a small amount sending prices back into the midseventies that could be done virtually overnight simply an announcement would move the market dramatically if opec would simply hold to its  quota and russia would return to its previous output of approximately  million barrels per day that would remove nearly  million barrels of daily supply certainly enough to move the market instead saudi arabia has virtually singlehandedly positioned half of opec on the brink of financial disaster they are spending cash that took them decades to amass and seem determined not to make the one move that could return oil prices to a level that works well for everyone it just makes no sense and appears to be getting worse written by chris faulkner breitling energy ceo chairman and author of “the fracking truth

a ‘wait and see’ approach july  in in the press by breitling energyafter  straight weeks of declines the rig count for us oil and gas operations has gone up for two weeks in a row while the reversal is offering some hope the industry’s downturn since last november has finally hit bottom energy analysts aren’t ready to start popping champagne corks “there are just too many variables that can take it higher or lower” said tom petrie chairman of petrie partners a denverbased investment banking firm that offers financial advice to the oil and gas industry “it takes more than a few rigs being put back on to give me conviction that we couldn’t just see a little pause and then another trip down” the closely watched rig count for oil and gas fields was up by one friday in the weekly survey by the houstonbased oil field service company baker hughes inching up from  to  that came after baker hughes reported a net plus of three the previous week oil rigs alone were up five last friday and  the week before that snapped a week losing streak dating back to the decision by the organization petroleum exporting countries last thanksgiving to not cut crude production opec’s decision kept the supply of worldwide oil pumping resulting in a dramatic drop in global oil and gasoline prices which in turn led north american producers to lose money cut back production and lay off thousands of employees opec’s move was interpreted — at least in part — as a way to significantly hurt us shale producers whose hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques challenged persian gulf oil giants such as saudi arabia for worldwide market share while the move into positive territory for rig counts the past two weeks has been small it’s led some analysts to think the worst may be over for north american producers morgan stanley research analyst ole slorer got wall street buzzing thursday after releasing a report citing the us rig count reversal as a sign the global oil market may be stabilizing that could mean the report said that the longterm price of brent crude — the widely accepted international price — will reach  a barrel brent futures were trading at  on friday “from here we see a very attractive riskreward on a  month view” slorer’s report to investors said adding that “green shoots are becoming visible” that would be welcome news for the oil and gas industry in the united states “we think the worst of the danger is behind us” said chris faulkner ceo of breitling energy pointing out that since the oil crunch hit nearly eight months ago us shale companies have become more efficient and are now wellpositioned to make money even though oil prices are lower “production numbers are up and saudi arabia is not winning the game” faulkner said while us rig counts were up one on friday the number in canada was up  dan steffens energy analyst and president of the houstonbased energy prospectus group said the oil slump “probably has bottomed out” but doesn’t expect to see north american producers suddenly going back to drilling lots of wells right away “all these big companies have set their capital budgets at the first of the year” steffens told watchdogorg “they don’t change that budget unless there’s some sort of drastic change in commodity prices they’re pretty much locked in” petrie said there are simply too many factors on the economic and geopolitical scene to make him confident enough to declare the worst is over “i could come up with scenarios that this is the case but i could come up with plenty of others where this is just a head fake” petrie said in a telephone interview part of the uncertainty revolves around a potential nuclear deal with iran a member of opec that has seen its oil production slashed in recent years due to economic sanctions but if a deal is finalized iran will insist on getting those sanctions lifted quickly should that happen more downward pressure would be applied on keeping oil prices low “we’d have to factor in another million barrels a day coming on over the next year” petrie said “not immediately but they have  million barrels in storage if they can get an agreement they can start selling some of that oil if you’re thinking about stepping up your drilling … you’re not going to act on it until they see what happens with iran” other potential wild cards include last week’s meltdown in the chinese stock market and the debt crisis in greece although steffens downplays their importance “this dip in the chinese market” steffens said “well stocks don’t use oil and gas cars do i don’t see that being a big thing and i sure don’t see this deal with greece as a big crush in oil demand anywhere they’re such a small part of the european economy” emerging markets investment guru mark mobius pronounced thursday that “china is still growing at a good pace” an encouraging sign for oil and gas producers who want to keep seeing demand from the world’s secondlargest economy growing “mobius may be right but that doesn’t mean it’s up up and away from here” petrie said “that’s why you’re getting a mealy mouthed answer from me because i feel mealy mouthed about it” written by rob

devastating impact not just with uranium july  in in the press by breitling energythe elastic iranian nuclear sanctions deadline has passed once again with the umpteenth extension  like to so many other agendadriven initiatives the past six years the administration’s spotlight is now focused on welcoming iran back into the global marketplace at a price and it appears nothing will deter this like nothing stopped so many other selfinitiated programs throughout this presidency a recent headline pretty much sums up not only the negotiations but the pattern through which this president has been forcing his agenda  “what happens in vienna stays in vienna”  didn’t we just see something similar during the pacific trade talks  now john kerry sits behind airtight doors with a virtual blankcheck mandate to make this deal happen whenever however what has happened to america one outcome of the negotiations aside from iran being able to openly resume their nuclear program will be millions of barrels of iranian oil flooding an already oversaturated world crude market  this could have disastrous consequences we recently witnessed a black monday in oil prices as a singleday percent drop left markets reeling  a triad of bad news seemed to tip the scales downward likely in a move that may not reverse quickly  in addition greece imploding and chinese stocks crashing reports of a possible sanctions agreement also plagued nervous commodity trading pits president obama has shown no strategic regard for america’s energy policy  putting iran in a position to dump oil on the market will be bad for the entire ecosystem  thanks to america’s renaissance due to hydraulic fracturing the world has more than enough oil to meet current and future demands  middle eastern countries are hemorrhaging cash from low oil prices  smaller producing nations who don’t have financial stockpiles could face future defaults if prices don’t stabilize soon  american producers who don’t have margins at  oil could finally succumb to this latest downturn  russia’s economy continues to flounder as anything below at least  means pain for putin iran cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons  period  even the strangest of bedfellows saudi arabia and israel agree on that  nor can it be trusted that whatever agreement is finally reached will actually be enforced  history tells us that while it appears we are on the doorstep of allowing yet another rogue nation restored trade and diplomatic status this deal could have immediate and potentially catastrophic consequences on the energy
