home→collections→navypromotion restores shine to tarnished navy careerapril  by thomas w waldron  thomas w waldronwashington bureau of the sunwashington  three years ago the highflying military career of joseph w prueher seemed finished  grounded by an incident during his tenure as a top official at the us naval academy in which a female midshipman was handcuffed to a urinalseveral navy officers in the past few years have seen their careers tarnished or shortcircuited by criticism over their handling of sexual harassment cases but thanks to patient support from the top ranks of the pentagon admiral prueher managed to survive even flourishhis turnaround culminated thursday when the senate confirmed him as vice chief of naval operations  the navys secondhighest uniformed positionto his supporters in the navy the ascension of joe prueher pronounced preeer is vindication for an honorable and conscientious officer whose name had been unfairly tainted by the handcuffing caseeven us sen barbara a mikulski a member of the academys governing board of visitors gave her blessing to admiral prueher in a recent meeting concluding that the incident had taught him a good lesson about women in the militarybut the parents of the female midshipman at the center of the incident say they are still angry that admiral prueher was never held accountable for the relatively lax punishments in the case his rise they say is evidence that the navys old boy system is alive and wellto me joe prueher is the epitome of the failure of navy leadership said carolyn dreyer the mother of gwen m dreyer the female midshipman it was handled horribly but he somehow magically escapedms dreyer then a secondyear midshipman was handcuffed to a urinal in a mens restroom after a campus snowball fight in december  eight male midshipmen were punished none severelynot long after the incident ms dreyer left the naval academy and graduated from california polytechnic state university at san luis obispo in  she works as an engineer for apple computer and plans to get married in august she declined to be interviewedwhile some navy people said the incident was nothing more than academy horseplay others said it symbolized a macho campus atmosphere that sometimes left women feeling denigrated and unwelcome at the predominantly male academyon capitol hill criticism of the navys handling of the case mounted the the career of the naval academy superintendent adm virgil l hill jr was derailed he received a lateral transfer after his annapolis duty instead of the standard promotion and has left the navyas commandant of midshipmen the no  officer at the academy and the one responsible for disciplining student misconduct thencaptain prueher was deeply involved in the dreyer case and according to ms dreyers parents he mishandled ither father gregory f dreyer himself a naval academy graduate said in  that when he complained about the academys handling of the case captain prueher told him to back off or he would release photographs taken by midshipmen that showed ms dreyer smiling during the handcuffingcongressional staffers remembered admiral pruehers role and sent up red flags in  when president george bush nominated him to assume command of the navys rd fleet based in san diegowith the tailhook scandal unfolding  marked by charges that drunken navy fliers had fondled and humiliated women  sensitivity to allegations of sexual harassment was running highrather than engage in a public fight in the senate and risk losing admiral pruehers  nomination altogether navy leaders withdrew his name from considerationanother chanceseveral months later the mood on capitol hill had softened enough to convince admiral frank b kelso ii  then chief of naval operations  and others that admiral prueher wouldreceive a fair hearing he was nominated for another promotionthe dreyers again told congressional staffers about their unhappiness with admiral pruehers handling of their daughters case despite their criticism his nomination cleared the senateit was clear that he wasnt in charge at the academy at the time said a senate staffer familiar with admiral pruehers  confirmation other than that one case he had a good recorda few months later the senate approved a second promotion to the threestar rank of vice admiral in his new position he holds the fourstar rank of admiralto help smooth the current promotion admiral prueher paid three courtesy calls two to the senators from his home state of tennessee and one to senator mikulski a maryland democrat and a leading voice on womens issues in congressthe senator had deep concerns about the disciplinary actions in the dreyer case a mikulski aide said admiral prueher said he told the senator he would have handled the dreyer case differently today ms dreyer deserved more sympathy the admiral said and those responsible for the incident possibly deserved harsher punishment    next morecharles kuralts other life scandal the
