ms jefferies holds a bachelor of laws and a bachelor of commerce degree     corporate responsibility and sustainability building a sustainable business  was a milestone year – platinum celebrated its th anniversary and its funds under management fum exceeded a billion from a startingpoint of a team of four investment professionals and a handful of support staff platinum has built a strong brand name and a reputation that is the envy of the financial services industry  this reputation has been achieved by staying true to platinum’s key objective – delivering superior returns over time and communicating the intricacies of global investing and providing investors with steady longterm performance the business of platinum is to manage clients’ money  it charges clients a fee for doing so and these fees are platinum’s chief source of revenue  we at platinum have a simple core belief  if platinum responsibly and successfully looks after investors’ money its business should prosper  a failure to understand and commit to this priority will not result in an enduring wealth management business marketing commissions and other devices notwithstanding being a responsible money manager history of strong performance our history has been punctuated with recurrent market challenges – the asian monetary crisis of  the tech bubble of  and the more recent global financial crisis of   in spite of these challenges we have seized the many opportunities presented by the market and have over the longterm typically outperformed the benchmark msci index by a significant margin  as at  may  the flagship platinum international fund had achieved an average compound annual return of  since its inception in  compared to  for the msci all country world net index  indeed the majority of our platinum trust funds have performed strongly over the longterm delivering superior returns to our investors click here for more information on the performance of all publicly available platinum funds investment process how did we achieve these strong returns  platinum is wellknown for its distinctive stock selection methodology which seeks out a broad range of investments where the market has for transient reasons mispriced their business  to do this platinum employs a team of highly skilled specialist analysts who take a global perspective and apply screening and intensive research to isolate real as opposed to imagined issues in applying platinum’s thematic contrarian investment method we build each portfolio from individual stock selections rather than from any predetermined asset allocation at times whole sectors or industries may be misunderstood and this can give rise to several investments in that and related areas we pay no heed to the weightings of any benchmark such as the msci index   investment risks are actively monitored and managed through appropriate measures such as the use of derivatives and currency hedging where permitted under the fund’s mandate a more detailed description of our investment process can be found here and click here for further information on platinum’s risk management strategies better engagement with investors in addition to the core principle of striving for superior longterm performance in global equity investments platinum’s business has been founded on the following precepts no upfront fees no exit fees no trailing commissions to financial intermediaries or advisers no soft dollar benefits paid to or received from financial advisers or advisory firms forward pricing no “market timing” or “late trading” of unit trust products we support financial advisers with quality presentations from the investment team we give biennial investor presentations for those investing directly with us we provide clear and engaging quarterly investor reports we provide consistent high service standards to clients and advisers all of these principles were adopted with the single aim of better servicing our clients and none of which has altered over the  years of platinum’s growth ethical conduct the ethical standards of the financial services industry have been facing increasing scrutiny worldwide since the global financial crisis  platinum has always held the highest standards of integrity and honesty and has put in place robust policies aiming to prevent unethical conduct such as fraud bribery and insider trading  given the nature of platinum’s business we are particularly mindful of the risks of insider trading and personal dealing  platinum has therefore implemented appropriate systems of ongoing monitoring and regular training to ensure compliance by all staff members with our business rules of conduct and trading policy ethical investment platinum regards the subject of ethical investing as highly complex and points to the contradictions and conflicts that are an essential element of the capitalist system  we have no way of individually assessing the beliefs and values of our investors or the companies in which we invest cognisant of the diversity of views on these subjects platinum decided at this stage not to adopt any formalised ethical investment policy in selecting retaining and realising investments  however that is not to say that ethical considerations such as environmental responsibility and labour standards do not play a part in our investment process  our investment analysts routinely take such factors into consideration when assessing the overall quality and sustainability of an investment prospect it has been our experience that when our values of fair play and ethics are upheld by the company under scrutiny it tends to lead to fewer disappointments as an investment  to adopt a more formal set of ethical investment criteria would require platinum to develop a template of ethical values that hopefully satisfies the majority of unit holders on matters including labour standards environmental impact social intercourse political system governance behaviour and standards national institutions and so on  in our view it is not possible to create such a template without unduly imposing a set of values on all investors regardless of whether they share these values workplace diversity and flexibility in a serviceoriented business like platinum our people are our greatest asset  that is why we focus equally on attracting the best talent and providing an inclusive and supportive work environment for our staff platinum actively promotes a culture of equal opportunity and has the principles of meritocracy fairness equality and contribution to commercial success at all levels within the company  we value the blend of skills perspectives styles and attitudes available to the company through a diverse workforce and recognise that such diversity has contributed to our business success  for example our investment research team includes not only economists and finance experts but also scientists and engineers  you can find more information about our investment team here in this context workplace diversity includes gender age ethnicity cultural background and more  to promote workplace diversity our board has adopted a diversity policy in addition to a workplace antidiscrimination  antiharassment policy  the diversity policy includes a set of clear objectives as part of our corporate governance practice  these include to provide flexibility to staff members  in this context workplace flexibility involves developing people management strategies that accommodate differences in background perspectives and family responsibilities of staff to include in the recruitment process for vacant positions a diversified group including gender diversity of candidates  this further extends to the interview process for vacant positions on platinum’s board of directors to provide training opportunities with the aim of bringing through the underlying potential of staff established a diversity committee comprising representatives from each business area  the diversity committee will meet periodically and will monitor progress on boardrecommended diversity strategies and make recommendations to the board for further diversity opportunities the following statistics current as of  may  demonstrate platinum’s ongoing endeavours to promote diversity and flexible work arrangements  this has allowed platinum to exceed the country’s average in many aspects for example the representation of women on the board and in senior executive positions women employed on a parttime basis and the percentage of workforce made up of people born outside australia   diversity criteria platinum  australia  women on the board   of   women in senior executive positions   of   women in the workforce   of   women in line roles   of   women employed on a parttime basis   of   workforce over  years of age   of   workforce made up of people born outside australia   of   workforce made up of people with tertiary qualifications   of   workforce made up of people identified as aboriginal or torres strait islander people   of   platinum’s efforts to create an inclusive and supportive work culture have resulted in excellent retention rates  for example the average investment management industry experience of our fund managers was  years as at  may  with an average of  years at platinum  the average number of years with platinum for the remainder of the investment team was more than five years  the average number of years at platinum for noninvestment team staff was nearly seven years  moreover it is not uncommon to find departed employees rejoin platinum after spending several years in other countries or industries making a contribution to the financial advisory industry at platinum we believe that being a member of the financial services industry entails a duty to help improve the industry financial reform financial advisers play an important part in australia’s financial services system  the government has essentially forced the public through savingssuperannuation schemes to rely on intermediaries to secure their longterm financial wellbeing  however there is confusion in our legislation as to the obligations of independence of financial advice in early  we took the opportunity of the future of financial advice fofa reform bill and made a submission to the senate inquiry on this important issue  we pointed out the huge concentration of power in the hands of the country’s four big banks and the detriments their considerable influence over financial advisers can bring to the investing public  in highlighting the lack of protection investors face regarding the efficacy of advice obtained from financial intermediaries we urged the lawmakers to give more consideration to the interest of the public in the fofa reform education to play a small part in raising the professionalism in the financial advisory industry platinum together with the neilson foundation are funding a total of  scholarships a year at five australian universities each scholarship being to the value of  per year the scholarships are to be awarded to students who are majoring in financial planning  of the scholarships awarded since the programme began in  have been awarded to female students platinum has further committed to providing valuable work experience opportunities for two candidates from this programme each year commitment to climate action we are committed to operating our business in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner platinum continues its longstanding commitment to combating climate change with the measurement and offsetting of its carbon footprint  “funds under management fum” ie the amount of money that we manage is the key variable for platinum’s business
