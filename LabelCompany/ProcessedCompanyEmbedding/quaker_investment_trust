investments implementation solutions by sam masemer cfa cfp® and alyssa ballin cfs   the alternative investment value proposition heightened volatility and increased correlations across equity markets have investors searching for nontraditional methods to enhance diversification within asset allocation models  historically alternative investments have satisfied this enhanced diversification desire but were only available to wealthy individuals and institutions  today alternative investments are available in a traditional mutual fund format for all investors  so how does an investor transition from a highly correlated portfolio to one that is welldiversified by allocating to alternative investments  one approach would be to study the asset allocation models of endowments   endowments and alternative investments endowments have utilized alternative investments for diversification purposes for decades  in fact the percentage by which they have allocated assets to alternative investments has recently spiked figure  illustrates how endowments dramatically increased their allocation to alternative investments from  to   the primary funding vehicle utilized to increase the allocation to alternative investments was the equity portfolio during this nineyear period the percentage of total allocation to alternative investments increased at times by as much as  while equities decreased by as much as  these allocation tradeoffs were made in response to the rising correlations of traditional equity asset classes which spurred endowments’ efforts to pursue greater diversification within their asset allocation models  “the allocation shift from equities to alternative investments by endowments appears to coincide with rising equity correlations”   diversification increasingly difficult to attain approximately a decade ago a modicum of diversification was achieved by investing across domestic equity market capitalizations foreign equities and fixed income figure  demonstrates how investors’ ability to achieve diversification in the equity portion of an allocation has clearly changed as the correlations of all domestic equity market capitalizations and foreign equities have increased significantly versus large cap domestic equities  the allocation shift from equities to alternative investments by endowments appears to coincide with rising equity correlations   “investing in lower market capitalizations no longer achieves the same level of diversification  the residual effect is primarily increased volatility”   are high equity correlations here to stay it is difficult to believe there could be a meaningful decrease in correlations in the near term  it is our observation that one of the main causes of rising correlations in equities is the proliferation of exchange traded fund etf assets  there appears to be a causal effect between increasing assets under management of us etfs and rising correlations across equity market capitalizations figure  illustrates the explosive increase in the growth rate of etfs  this continued growth year after year leads us to conclude that high equity correlations could be here to stay  “by redistributing a portion of the equity allocation to alternative investments investors could improve their portfolio diversification while potentially creating a smoother return stream”   how can investors increase their allocation to alternative investments pairing asset classes and investments that are lowly correlated can potentially reduce portfolio volatility  we have demonstrated how endowments have decreased their exposure to equities by redistributing these assets to alternative investments an individual investor contemplating this same course of action must determine what equity risk profile is appropriate to achieve their goals and if they are comfortable with the associated risk  figure  illustrates the volatility represented by rolling fiveyear beta of major equity asset classes as compared to the largecap domestic equity asset class  the graph illustrates how the highly correlated domestic equity sleeve becomes more volatile as market capitalizations decrease  therefore assuming that most investors have an allocation to largecap equities investing in lower market capitalizations no longer achieves the same level of diversification  the residual effect is primarily increased volatility  “pairing asset classes and investments that are lowly correlated can potentially reduce porfolio volatility” one cannot invest directly in an index  diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market  alternative investments may result in additional risk due to their complexity and possible illiquidity and require specialized investment expertise  investments in smaller companies involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies    endnotes   correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other as measured by the correlation coefficient a statistic that ranges in value from  to  indicating a perfect negative correlation at  absence of correlation at zero and perfect positive correlation at   alternative investments are those that fall outside the traditional asset classes of stocks bonds and cash  asset allocations by endowments
