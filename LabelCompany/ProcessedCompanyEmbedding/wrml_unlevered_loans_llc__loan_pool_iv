online via comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of newcastle the following should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein and with part ii item a risk factors general newcastle is a real estate investment trust that focuses on opportunistically investing in and actively managing a variety of real estate related and other investments we actively manage a portfolio of real estate related securities real estate related and other loans senior living facilities and other assets our investment guidelines are purposefully broad to enable us to make investments in a wide array of assets our objective is to maximize the difference between the yield on our investments and the cost of financing these investments we often seek to hedge our interest rate risk we emphasize portfolio management asset quality liquidity diversification match funded financing and credit risk management we are externally managed and advised by our manager fig llc an affiliate of fortress investment group llc fortress fortress is a leading global investment manager with approximately  billion in assets under management as of june   through our manager we have a team of senior investment professionals experienced in real estate capital markets structured finance and asset management we believe that these critical skills position us well not only to make prudent investment decisions but also to monitor and manage the credit profile of our investments on may   we spun off certain of our investments to new residential investment corp new residential a new publicly traded reit primarily focused on investing in residential mortgage related assets we contributed to new residential all of our investments in excess mortgage servicing rights excess msrs the nonagency rmbs we had acquired since the second quarter of  certain agency arm rmbs the residential mortgage loans we had acquired since the beginning of  our interest in a portfolio of consumer loans and a cash and cash equivalents balance of  million the spinoff was effected as a taxable pro rata distribution by newcastle of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of new residential to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on may   the distribution ratio was one share of new residential common stock for each share of newcastle common stock we now conduct our business through the following segments i investments in senior living assets financed with nonrecourse debt nonrecourse senior living ii investments financed with nonrecourse collateralized debt obligations nonrecourse cdos iii unlevered investments in deconsolidated newcastle cdo debt unlevered cdos iv investments financed with other nonrecourse debt nonrecourse other v investments and debt repurchases financed with recourse debt recourse vi other unlevered investments unlevered other and vii corporate with respect to the nonrecourse cdos and nonrecourse other segments newcastle is generally entitled to receive net cash flows from these structures on a periodic basis revenues attributable to each segment as restated for previously reported periods are disclosed below in thousands nonrecourse for the six months senior nonrecourse unlevered nonrecourse unlevered intersegment ended june  living cdos cdos other recourse other corporate elimination total                                          excludes  million and  million of revenue for the six months ended june   and  respectively from excess msrs which as previously stated were spunoff unless otherwise noted the information provided in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects only the business segments that remain part of our business following the spinoff of new residential market considerations our ability to generate income is dependent on among various other factors our ability to raise capital and finance investments on favorable terms deploy capital on a timely basis at attractive returns and exit investments at favorable yields market conditions outside of our control such as interest rates credit spreads and stock market volatility affect these objectives in a variety of ways our ability to execute our business strategy particularly the growth of our investment portfolio depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional capital in the first half of  we successfully accessed the capital markets issuing  shares for a total net proceeds of  million however rising interest rates or stock market volatility could impair our ability to raise equity capital on attractive terms interest rates have risen significantly in recent months and may continue to increase although the timing of further increases is uncertain we have investments in both floating and fixed rate real estate related securities and loans which are affected by interest rates in different ways we expect that the value of floating rate assets would not be significantly affected by a changes in interest rates whether an increase or decrease since the coupon tracks the movement in rates while the value of fixed rate assets can be negatively affected by rising interest rates however in general rising interest rates are usually indicative of a strengthening economic environment which could reduce the credit risk of some of our investments with respect to our fixed rate assets we believe that the negative impact of rising interest rates could potentially be offset by the positive impact of reduced credit risk our senior living acquisitions have been financed with a combination of fixed and floating rate debt rising interest rates would increase the cost of our floating rate financing and negatively impact the returns on our senior living investments in our view the senior living sector continues to present an attractive investment opportunity we believe projected demand for senior living facilities based on changing demographics and limited new supply creates favorable supplydemand fundamentals in addition we avoid pricing competition with other active reit buyers of large portfolios by targeting smaller highquality but underperforming portfolios with competitive pricing fundamentals we expect to capitalize on our managers experience in the sector to generate growth in propertylevel net operating income through the implementation of operational and structural efficiencies credit spreads also affect the value of our investments in debt securities and loans credit spreads decreased or tightened in the first half of  relative to  which has had a favorable impact on the value of our portfolio credit spreads measure the yield relative to a specified benchmark that the market demands on securities and loans based on such assets credit risk the value of our portfolio tends to increase when spreads tighten because under these circumstances the yield on our investments will generally be higher than the yield available on comparable new investments however tightening spreads tend to reduce the yields available on potential new investments when spreads increase or widen the potential yields on new investments increase but the value of our existing investments in debt securities and loans tends to decline as a result widening spreads negatively affect our ability to exit investments at attractive returns credit spreads also affect the cost of financing with widening spreads tending to increase the cost and tightening spreads tending to reduce it application of critical accounting policies managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses actual results could differ from these estimates management believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable actual results historically have been in line with managements estimates and judgments used in applying each of the accounting policies described below as modified periodically to reflect current market conditions the following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most effected by judgments estimates and assumptions variable interest entities variable interest entities vies are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties a vie is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary and only by its primary beneficiary which is defined as the party who has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie the vies in which we have a significant interest include i our cdos and ii our manufactured housing loan financing structures we do not have the power to direct the relevant activities of cdo v as a result of an event of default which allows us to be removed as collateral manager of this cdo and prevents us from purchasing or selling certain collateral within this cdo and therefore we deconsolidated this cdo as of june   similar events of default in the future if they occur could cause us to deconsolidate additional financing structures we completed two securitization transactions to refinance our manufactured housing loans portfolios i and ii we analyzed the securitizations under the applicable accounting guidance and concluded that the securitization transactions should be accounted for as secured borrowings as a result we continue to recognize the portfolios of manufactured housing loans as pledged assets which have been classified as loans heldforinvestment at securitization and recorded the notes issued to third parties as secured borrowings our subprime securitizations are also considered vies but we do not control their activities and no longer receive a significant portion of their returns and therefore do not consolidate them in addition our investments in rmbs cmbs cdo securities and loans may be deemed to be variable interests in vies depending on their structure we monitor these investments and analyze the potential need to consolidate the related securitization entities pursuant to the vie consolidation requirements these analyses require considerable judgment in determining whether an entity is a vie and determining the primary beneficiary of a vie since they involve subjective determinations of significance with respect to both power and economics the result could be the consolidation of an entity that otherwise would not have been consolidated or the deconsolidation of an entity that otherwise would have been consolidated valuation of securities we have classified all our real estate securities as available for sale as such they are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent impairment losses are considered temporary as described below fair value may be based upon broker quotations counterparty quotations or pricing services quotations which provide valuation estimates based upon reasonable market order indications or a good faith estimate thereof and are subject to significant variability based on market conditions such as interest rates credit spreads and market liquidity a significant portion of our securities are currently not traded in active markets and therefore have little or no price transparency for a further discussion of this trend see  market considerations above as a result we have estimated the fair value of these illiquid securities based on internal pricing models rather than the sources described above the determination of estimated cash flows used in pricing models is inherently subjective and imprecise changes in market conditions as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value could result in a significant and immediate increase or decrease in our book equity for securities valued with pricing models these inputs include the discount rate assumptions relating to prepayments default rates and loss severities as well as other variables see note  to our consolidated financial statements in part i item  financial statements for information regarding the fair value of our investments and its estimation methodology as of june   our securities must be categorized by the level of inputs used in estimating their fair values level  would be assets valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets we have no level  assets level  would be assets valued based on quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments on quoted prices in less active or inactive markets or on other observable market inputs level  would be assets valued based significantly on unobservable market inputs we have further broken level  into level a third party indications and level b internal models fair value under gaap represents an exit price in the normal course of business not a forced liquidation price if we were forced to sell assets in a short period to meet liquidity needs the prices we receive could be substantially less than the recorded fair values we generally classify the broker and pricing service quotations we receive as level a inputs except for certain liquid securities they are quoted prices in generally inactive and illiquid markets for identical or similar securities these quotations are generally received via email and contain disclaimers which state that they are indicative and not actionable  meaning that the party giving the quotation is not bound to actually purchase the security at the quoted price these quotations are generally based on models prepared by the brokers and we have little visibility into the inputs they use based on quarterly procedures we have performed with respect to quotations received from these brokers including comparison to the outputs generated from our internal pricing models and transactions we have completed with respect to these securities as well as on our knowledge and experience of these markets we have generally determined that these quotes represent a reasonable estimate of fair value for the  million carrying value of securities valued using quotations as of june   a  basis point change in credit spreads would impact estimated fair value by approximately  million our estimation of the fair value of level b assets as described below involves significant judgment we validated the inputs and outputs of our models by comparing them to available independent third party market parameters where available and models for reasonableness we believe the assumptions we used are within the range that a market participant would use and factor in the liquidity conditions currently in the markets in the period ended june   the inputs to our models including discount rates prepayment speeds default rates and severity assumptions have generally remained consistent with the assumptions used at december   other than certain modifications we have made to the assumptions to reflect conditions relevant to specific assets for cmbs and abs valued with internal models which have an aggregate fair value of  million as of june   a  unfavorable change in our assumptions would result in the following decreases in such aggregate fair value in thousands cmbs abs outstanding face amount     fair value     effect on fair value with  unfavorable change in discount rate     prepayment rate na   default rate     loss severity     impairment of securities we must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities if any reflect a decline in value which is otherthantemporary and if so write the impaired security down to its fair value through earnings a decline in value is deemed to be otherthantemporary if i it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a security which was not impaired at acquisition there is an expected credit loss or ii if we have the intent to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position prior to its anticipated recovery if any for the purposes of performing this analysis we assume the anticipated recovery period is until the respective securitys expected maturity also for certain securities that represent beneficial interests in securitized financial assets whenever there is a probable adverse change in the timing or amounts of estimated cash flows of a security from the cash flows previously projected an otherthan temporary impairment will be deemed to have occurred our nonagency rmbs acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality for which it was deemed probable at acquisition that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments as they come due fall within the scope of loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality as opposed to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets we note that primarily all of our securities except our fnmafhlmc securities and our nonagency rmbs acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality fall within the definition of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets temporary declines in value generally result from changes in market factors such as market interest rates and credit spreads or from certain macroeconomic events including market disruptions and supply changes which do not directly impact our ability to collect amounts contractually due we continually evaluate the credit status of each of our securities and the collateral supporting our securities this evaluation includes a review of the credit of the issuer of the security if applicable the credit rating of the security the key terms of the security including credit support debt service coverage and loan to value ratios the performance of the pool of underlying loans and the estimated value of the collateral supporting such loans including the effect of local industry and broader economic trends and factors these factors include loan default expectations and loss severities which are analyzed in connection with a particular securitys credit support as well as prepayment rates these factors are also analyzed in relation to the amount of the unrealized loss and the period elapsed since it was incurred the result of this evaluation is considered when determining managements estimate of cash flows particularly with respect to developing the necessary inputs and assumptions each security is impacted by different factors and in different ways generally the more negative factors which are identified with respect to a given security the more likely we are to determine that we do not expect to receive all contractual payments when due with respect to that security significant judgment is required in this analysis as of june   we had  securities with a carrying amount of  million that had been downgraded during the period ended june   we did not record a net otherthantemporary impairment charge on these securities in the period ended june   however we do not depend on credit ratings in underwriting our securities either at acquisition or on an ongoing basis as mentioned above a credit rating downgrade is one factor that we monitor and consider in our analysis regarding otherthantemporary impairment but it is not determinative our securities generally benefit from the support of one or more subordinate classes of securities or equity or other forms of credit support therefore credit rating downgrades even to the extent they relate to an expectation that a securitization we have invested in on an overall basis has credit issues may not ultimately impact cash flow estimates for the class of securities in which we are invested furthermore the analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in an unrealized loss position prior to an expected recovery in value if any the amount of such expected required sales and the projected identification of which securities would be sold is also subject to significant judgment particularly in times of market illiquidity such as we are currently experiencing revenue recognition on securities income on our securities is recognized using a level yield methodology based upon a number of cash flow assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies such assumptions include the rate and timing of principal and interest receipts which may be subject to prepayments and defaults these assumptions are updated on at least a quarterly basis to reflect changes related to a particular security actual historical data and market changes these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events and economic and market conditions which may alter the assumptions for securities acquired at a discount for credit losses we recognize the excess of all cash flows expected over our investment in the securities as interest income on a lossadjusted yield basis the lossadjusted yield is determined based on an evaluation of the credit status of securities as described in connection with the analysis of impairment above valuation of derivatives similarly our derivative instruments are carried at fair value fair value is based on counterparty quotations newcastle reports the fair value of derivative instruments gross of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and fair value is reflected on a net counterparty basis when newcastle believes a legal right of offset exists under an enforceable netting agreement to the extent they qualify as cash flow hedges net unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income otherwise the net unrealized gains and losses are reported currently in income to the extent they qualify as fair value hedges net unrealized gains or losses on both the derivative and the related portion of the hedged item are reported currently in income fair values of such derivatives are subject to significant variability based on many of the same factors as the securities discussed above including counterparty credit risk the results of such variability the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the extent to which a forecasted hedged transaction remains probable of occurring could result in a significant increase or decrease in our gaap equity andor earnings loans we invest in loans including but not limited to real estate related and other loans including corporate bank loans commercial mortgage loans residential mortgage loans manufactured housing loans and subprime mortgage loans loans for which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are classified as heldforinvestment loans for which we do not have the intent or the ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are classified as heldforsale loans are presented in the consolidated balance sheet net of any unamortized discount or gross of any unamortized premium and an allowance for loan losses we determine at acquisition whether loans will be aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics credit quality loan type and date of origination or acquisition loans aggregated into pools are accounted for as if each pool were a single loan impairment of loans to the extent that they are classified as held for investment we must periodically evaluate each of these loans or loan pools for possible impairment impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan or for loans acquired at a discount for credit losses when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect as anticipated upon determination of impairment we would establish a specific valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to earnings we continually evaluate our loans receivable for impairment our residential mortgage loans including manufactured housing loans are aggregated into pools for evaluation based on like characteristics such as loan type and acquisition date individual loans are evaluated based on an analysis of the borrowers performance the credit rating of the borrower debt service coverage and loan to value ratios the estimated value of the underlying collateral the key terms of the loan and the effect of local industry and broader economic trends and factors pools of loans are also evaluated based on similar criteria including historical and anticipated trends in defaults and loss severities for the type and seasoning of loans being evaluated this information is used to estimate specific impairment charges on individual loans as well as provisions for estimated unidentified incurred losses on pools of loans significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance furthermore we must assess our intent and ability to hold our loan investments on a periodic basis if we do not have the intent to hold a loan for the foreseeable future or until its expected payoff the loan must be classified as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or estimated value revenue recognition on loans held for investment income on these loans is recognized similarly to that on our securities and is

loans error download document arron adam allison  years ago views transcription  demystifying loans  table of contents buoyant us performance supply and demand exceeded all expectations in the us vs the european loan market fundamental differences exist between regions  the nuances of the loan market new entrants should understand the unique characteristics of loans  future trends on the cards centralized clearing usage in repos and ucits compliance  partnering with an expert loan administrator loan investors benefit by tapping into strong knowledge and advanced technology  unlocking the potential of loans low interest rates and a lackluster riskreturn profile in equities provide incentives to seek value in alternative investments historic low yields on traditional fixedincome products are driving institutional investors to the loan market in search of better riskadjusted returns there are a few ways in which they could potentially gain exposure to loans but to execute a successful strategy they must be aware of the nuances of the asset class across multiple jurisdictions the global financial crisis has had a lingering effect on the investment environment and the choices available to institutions such as pension funds hedge funds insurance companies and private equity firms volatility in the equities markets which reached an alltime high in october  has decreased significantly during despite major gains in key indexes volumes have declined as investors reevaluate the riskreturn profile of the asset class value is also hard to find in the fixed income market interest rates in investment grade bonds are extremely low although rates on high yield bonds are more attractive meanwhile the european sovereign debt crisis has taken a toll on confidence to this end institutional investors are increasingly diversifying trying to generate alpha and funding their exposures by holding baskets of assets that include various types of loans secured investment grade bank loans are bilateral agreements between lenders and the borrowers subinvestment grade leveraged loans are usually syndicated bank loans that make up the balance of a private equity purchase of a business senior secured bonds and floating rate notes share in the same security pool as the senior secured lenders do not incorporate maintenance covenants and do not have standard wording for the intercreditor agreement common in the us covenantlite loans have similar recovery characteristics to senior secured high yield bonds finally collateralized loan obligations clos are special purpose vehicles backed with receivables from loans corporate trust   unlocking the potential of loans loans may offer a higher riskadjusted return compared to high yield bonds they usually have a lower default rate and a higher recovery rate importantly in the event of bankruptcy the borrower will typically repay lenders before bondholders highlights of us loan performance  us clo issuance  billion institutional pro rata spreads libor plus  to  basis points december  splsta leveraged loan index  billion a month high expected loan bids by yearend  expected  average default rate  source loan syndications and trading association lsta and bny mellon buoyant us performance  was a positive year for the us loan market by august clo issuance was higher than the last three years combined institutional spreads contracted  basis points and bid levels in the secondary market were already higher than anticipated by year end issuance already had exceeded expectations for the supply of loans has increased in fact the splsta leveraged loan index reached a month high in december demand has remained robust leading to heavily oversubscribed new issues and loans bidding higher in the secondary market restructures and amendments on loans also have played a significant role as many corporations amended their loan maturity dates amongst other provisions meanwhile default rates on syndicated loans remain at modest levels along with growth in the clo segment of the market bny mellon has seen larger flows into loans from traditional pension and government entity clients through unlevered loan portfolios the attributes of investing in loans inflation protection through a floating interest rate returns increase as interest rates rise us loans often have libor floors direct secured exposure to corporate credit an easily understood traditional asset class access to assets via a deep pipeline of primary assets and an established secondary market the opportunity to diversify exposure by issuer industry and geography   unlocking the potential of loans the us vs the european loan market today many asset managers are seeking global opportunities as such they should be aware of the differences between the two major loan markets in the us and europe the international capital market association icma european repo council estimates that the european bank loan market was worth approximately  trillion as of january this figure includes syndicated bilateral and club loans according to credit suisse s  leveraged finance outlook and  annual review the size of the european leveraged loan market was estimated at about  billion as of the end of september the characteristics of the european loan market tend to favor larger institutions that understand the complexities of working in multiple jurisdictions the market is dominated by a few banks and the secondary market is not as liquid as in the us traditionally there has been relatively more activity in high yield bonds than syndicated loans the us loan market is larger and more liquid than in europe driven by a number of factors for example us loans are typically publicly rated making it easier for investors to find out information about the assets significantly in the us a recent structural improvement for investors is the inclusion of libor floors which are not common in the european loan market as an example let s say libor is  the margin on the loan is  basis points over libor and the agreement includes a  libor floor rather than the borrower paying  libor plus the margin they will pay  libor floor plus the margin libor floors have allowed clos to recover much of the ground lost during the peak of the financial crisis through improved overcollateralization oc ratios and excess spread this applies to many existing clos that issued floating rate liabilities us and european loans have different governing documentation specifically existing european credit agreements will not allow electronic signatures also under lma standards in europe the agent bank typically is required to obtain the borrower s consent to transfer lenders whereas this is not always the case under lsta standards in the us this affects settlement times and liquidity us market large liquid market publiclyrated loans libor floors lsta documentation electronic signatures allowed european market diverse market favors larger institutions dominated by a few banks limited secondary market more high yield bonds than syndicated loans lma documentation electronic signatures not allowed practices vary across jurisdictions finally the borrowing process varies across europe while some investors find the diversification of the funds attractive they must be aware of the nuances in each jurisdiction   unlocking the potential of loans the nuances of the loan market specialized investment managers and credit hedge funds with around  billion in aum are the dominant players in loans these firms tend to have a corporate credit team with expertise in products such as clos knowledge of certain industries and the ability to manage the recovery process with banks deleveraging there are plenty of opportunities for new entrants that understand the following market characteristics and practices with banks deleveraging there are plenty of opportunities for new entrants that understand market characteristics and practices irregular cash flows a loan may be structured so the initial payments are made quarterly but then they might switch to semiannually weekly or even daily the terms of a loan may be amended to help a borrower get through the period of stress and then the loan reverts to the original terms moreover a loan may be renegotiated to extend the maturity and realign the repayment schedule with the borrower s anticipated cash flow the ability to amend and extend benefits the borrower and ultimately reduces the default rate long settlement cycle in the us the mean settlement cycle under lsta is around t and in europe the mean under lma is around t the industry is working with dtcc and euroclear to compress the time frame therefore allowing investors more flexibility fragmentation and paperbased processes around  agent banks globally act as issuing agents and registrars for the loans there is no central clearinghouse so lenders must work with this large network of agent banks each with its own systems and processes loans are traded through the execution of physical documents the investor s position is then recorded on the agent bank s books and records straight through processing is limited so transparency suffers as a result and errors may creep into the process at peak times that said there are efforts to move to a paperless environment agent banks in the us allow for electronic signatures on credit agreements european banks still require a physically signed document but the governing documentation has been amended on a go forward basis so a primary issuance may collect electronic signatures the lma is working with the agent banks to permit documentation on existing loans to be signed electronically as well   unlocking the potential of loans dtcc and markit have a combined offering that automates loan trade settlement by electronically managing the workflow legal requirements and ownership transfers that are central to loan transactions using dtcc s loanserv or euroclear s loanreach lenders may reconcile with the agent banks electronically verify that the client owns the position and settle the payments associated with the transaction akin to delivery vs payment opacity leveraged loan finance has been restricted to a relatively small number of institutions that have good access to information and borrowers and have little to gain by sharing their knowledge the borrowers do not necessarily want transparency either the financial information they supply to lenders is sensitive so they often feel more comfortable borrowing from a club of banks further only a few firms including markit reuters and bloomberg provide pricing on loans future trends in the near term the market will likely migrate toward centralized clearing with the majority of loans serviced through either dtcc s loanserv or euroclear s loanreach in the longer term the loan market will become partially dematerialized which will improve liquidity transparency and the settlement process in the longer term the loan market will become partially dematerialized which will improve liquidity transparency and the settlement process the icma european repo council launched an initiative to allow loans to be used as eligible collateral in repurchase agreements repos where securities are used as collateral for shortterm financing however privacy hurdles must be overcome before this is possible companies do not want their competitors to buy their syndicated loans because they would have access to confidential financial data that may not be in the audited financial statements a borrower typically must approve the lender in the transaction a know your customer process must be performed each time an investor buys and sells a loan and that may take three to seven days depending on the agent bank the industry is working to insert language in both loan and repo documentation to facilitate this process therefore enabling loans to be used as collateral in repo transactions finally the lma is working to make loans compliant with the undertakings for the collective investment of transferable securities ucits directive ucits are public limited companies that coordinate the distribution and management of unit trusts among countries within the european union ucits have not been allowed to invest in loans because of the lack of liquidity and transparency associated with the asset class but the lma is working to change this   unlocking the potential of loans partnering with an expert loan administrator clearly institutions could potentially benefit from investing in loans since loan structures may be complex there is significant benefit to partnering with an independent administrator that fully understands and is plugged into the agent bank process and network importantly the administrator will know how to restructure a loan and comprehend the upstream and downstream implications of doing so in addition the administrator will have the technology necessary to warehouse track monitor and value the assets ideally it will have a master database covering all available loans in the market when there is a new issue the administrator creates a global record that models the terms of the loan from the original loan documentation when an investor buys a loan becomes a lender the administrator only needs the administration agreement for the loan and the buy and sell ticket a good master database makes the process less labor intensive since loan structures may be complex there is significant benefit to partnering with an independent administrator that fully understands and is plugged into the agent bank process and network the administrator will likely take a consultative approach and provide innovative solutions comprising an array of services including syndicated loan services buy side automated feeds on rollovers interest rate changes and other loan data and provide a comprehensive reporting package to investors alternative investment services ais independent verification accounting servicing and reporting for investors in the hedge fund that owns the loan warehousing buy side loan administration custody services and reporting around the warehousing of the loan prior to the launch of a clo or new fund financial reporting accounting reports to help managers comply with fas  which requires some companies and investment managers to consolidate clos onto their balance sheet regulatory reporting in europe certain structures issue debt to the market and qualify as financial vehicle corporations fvcs the issuer must produce jurisdiction reports and comply with the filing requirements of the appropriate national central bank which in turn reports to the european central bank in accordance with regulation ec no in the us fatca requires that certain information be collected and shared the administrator s service offering will be able to navigate through fatca the tax implications and the agent networks the administrator will play a key role particularly in jurisdictions that do not have intergovernmental agreements igas facility agent sell side the ability to act as an independent borrower s agent in a syndicated loan notably when a borrower gets into difficulty and there are different tranches of loans the mezzanine tranche often is split out investors should partner with an administrator that has the resources to monitor the loans and act on their behalf a good administrator will shadow the agent on each loan to ensure all information pertaining to principal payments interest roll periods and payments in kind are processed correctly similarly they will support investors so they do not miss the opportunity to vote on a loan restructure for example or a payment moreover it will catch errors such as when an agent bank inadvertently deletes the investors from its system requiring the investors to prove ownership of a position   unlocking the potential of loans finally the administrator will have a paneuropean view this will be key for large investors who want to invest in different jurisdictions using various investment strategies for example a kapitalanlagegesellschaft kag is a regulated german capital investment company and sifs and sicavs are openended collective investment schemes common in luxembourg ireland has qualified investment funds qif and france has a securitization vehicle known as the fonds commun de titrisation fct these structures are increasingly being used to invest in loans but they all have their own nuances and tax implications that must be fully understood and navigated by partnering with an expert administrator and custodian that understands the asset class the process and technology systems investors should be well positioned to reap the potential benefits conclusion loans are garnering attention for reasons including the riskreturn profile low volatility and high recovery rates traditionally the high degree of specialization has been a barrier to entry for new participants who are not familiar with loan characteristics market practices and trading procedures by partnering with an expert administrator and custodian that understands the asset class the process and technology systems investors should be well positioned to reap the potential benefits authors jocelyn lynch
