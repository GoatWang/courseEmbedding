loss people purchase insurance policies from a company when buying a policy the person agrees to pay a premium which is small regular payment based on the losses that may occur if the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy the premium is usually higher premiums are often paid monthly and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured itemmany types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item the amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible in the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what if the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount the insurance company does not pay anything if the cost is greater than the deductible the policyholder only pays the deductible while the insurance pays the rest generally the deductible amount is related to your premium with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium and viceversainsurance agents selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage this is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most based on their needs and individual risk agents can often give potential customers a quote which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy this is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly credit scores play a major role in insurance scores but past insuranceclaim history is also taken into accountwhile agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance some sell several different types of insurance agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently selling policies from several different insurersinsurance productsalmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all useautomotive insurance millions of americans drive a car to get from place to place each day so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types in most states the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car up to a certain amount most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident its important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others not the policyholder themselves in addition to liability insurance car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident for this purpose liability vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policyinsurance can also be purchased for other vehicles like motorcycles atvs boats or rvs and generally functions similarly to car insurance policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles atvs boats and rvshomeowners insurance your home condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for so it makes sense to get it insured homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policylike auto insurance homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items the primary coverage type is for the dwelling insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it policies may also cover property within the home with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for much like auto insuranceproperty insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control these are known as perils and may include fire flooding natural disasters and other catastrophic events you may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a highrisk area flood insurance is an exception however and can be purchased through the governmentsponsored national flood insurance program your lender may require this if you live in a floodprone areahealth insurance to help pay for medical expenses many people rely on their health insurance with the passing of the affordable care act almost every american is required to enroll in a health care plan or they face a penalty health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance although it is probably used to cover expenses more often since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine health insurance also operates on a premiumdeductible model and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle for example if you visit doctors very infrequently you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible on the other hand people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by lawlife insurance when someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost life insurance comes in two basic types term and universal with a term life insurance plan you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time usually  years or more if you die at any point in that timeframe your family receives a death benefit if youre still around when the term is over the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing universal life covers your entire life and usually delivers a minimum benefit at deathtravel insurance travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel whether its losing luggage or medical treatment abroad travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trippet insurance pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog cat or other domestic animal medical care for animals can be very costly particularly because insurance for them is rare by paying into a premium you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication while virtually unheard of a few years ago pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to riseumbrella insurance umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies usually home or auto insurance consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover for example most car insurance liability policies cover at least  per person or  per accident but if the accident involves a very valuable car or the victim is willing to pursue legal action insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost you may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policyinsurance claims basicsto receive a payout for an insurance policy the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company the basics of the process are straightforward but can vary depending on the type of insuranceclaims adjusters and examiners a claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided an adjuster inspects claims related to property damage as in the case of auto or home insurance policies claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedureshow to make a claim filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses its important to note that in the case of emergencies you should always call  first the safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insuranceauto insurance claim if youre involved in an accident you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation you can file a claim upon obtaining the police report its also a good idea if possible to take your own notes at the scene the most important things to record are what happened before the accident the date and time traffic signs in the area and road conditions also be sure to get the other drivers name address license plate number and insurance information even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process once you have this documentation call your insurance company right away homeowners insurance claim in the case of damage take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible if any of your possessions were damaged use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim once an adjuster has made their own report review it for accuracy life insurance claim send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan as well as a certified copy of the policyholders death certificate with the proper information life insurance claims are generally straightforward problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy in this case an attorney may be needed to settle the claimfinding discounts on insuranceinsurance is a wise investment but it can make a dent in your monthly budget thankfully there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you needshop and compare perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible even after youve chosen a plan and started paying into it consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy while traditional agents can still find a good deal independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs the internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before potential customers can often get free quotes online very quicklybuy only what you need insurance agents will often try to upsell on various extra products that may be useful for certain people but are generally excessive for the average consumer stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs for example if the annual cost of your auto insurance is  percent or more of the total value of your car drop all but the most essential coverage this is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings otherwise you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash it can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policytake advantage of discounts insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances in one of the most basic discounts many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home auto and life insurance policies from the same provider car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course for those with teenagers on their plan good grades can earn a small discount as well insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel federal employees teachers first responders and their families we

with mixed reacations december   deetta quality  value  meets expectations  in chapter one of susan gregory and richard bloomers the daniel cure the daniel fast way to vibrant health the authors share millions of people exist in a state of severe spiritual and emotional hunger what do hungry people do they eat people who are spiritually and emotionally malnourished often feed themselves with the temporary nourishment of selfdefeating behaviors pg  of the provided ebook yes the daniel cure includes a day daniel cure devotional four chapters detailing the lifestyle diseases of obesity type  diabetes cardiovascular disease and inflammation chapters of recipes and meal planning advice a recipe index complete nutritional guidance and an appendix detailing the science behind the daniel fast overall i believe this is a great approach to gaining a healthy lifestyle i was pleased to read something from the christian community which went beyond fast to lifestyle the daniel cure may be most beneficial to those consuming the standard american diet or those who are suffering from one of the health issues of our times pure vegans or nutritarians may find the christian world view coupled with the spiritual aspects of fasting an encouragement i did i had mixed reactions one the current hype surrounding daniel fasts cures and plans which advocate eating what daniel did not eat  grates this is just an observation two daniel chapter one does not describe a fast daniel did not ping pong between eating plans what we call a fast was his eating plan three daniel ate vegetables fruits beans nuts seeds legumes grains and bread made from those grains he drank water this is what were told daniel ate i understand why susan recommends avoiding yeast however comments such as herbs are allowable in cold water but not in hot water meal replacement shakes arent beverages but juices are cooking with dates or applesauce are substitutions and not allowed but eating applesauce and dates are fine it all hit me as unneeded legalism im quite sure the holy spirit will help individuals sort this out in their personal fasts and yet i understand food lists are requested four richard bloomer really likes protein blanket statements are made that animal products are required for long term health he did not touch on any of the other studies which have shown a varied plant based diet is sustainable and provides many health benefits  the china study and any work by dr fuhrman come to mind more proof should have been provided in a book which focus on the benefits of a plant based fast and then recommends adding animal products to the lifestyle this may have taken away the big huh i had while reading this book  in an appendix he does mention findings which show hdl is lowered on a strictly vegan diet which is why he feels the need to add animal products five i love the focus on progress over perfection this leads the authors to encourage cheat meals as one who struggles with food addictions ive learned cheat meals often reawaken cravings which make staying on a healthy eating plan very hard for some cheat meals will be a blessing for some abstinence will be the bigger blessing overall i highly recommend the daniel cure by susan gregory and richard bloomer phd disclosure of material connection i received this book free from the publisher in exchange for an honest

expectations  i have never done a daniel fast and was doubtful i could do it for  weeks i decided to try one day which led to  days that led to the complete  days of fasting this book has great information on fasting how to do it according to the bible there are recipes and menus as an examples to follow you need to read the entire book before you begin and once youve decided to fast you need to be prepared first what i mean is you need to have the right food on hand i prepared the vegetable broth days ahead of time and froze portions i tried some of the recipes ahead of time to see what i liked i made the rice  beans recipe on page  and didnt like it the first time i had it however after a week of fasting i found that i did like it being on the fast has made my taste buds sharper fruit is sweeter even plain vegetables are delicious my oat bran is such a treat now with raisins and almonds with only  days to go i found that i was sad because the fast would soon be ending my husband ate what i did except he had meat and milk he wasnt fasting he lost  pounds i lost   pounds but my main goal was to seek god and draw near to him the very best part of the book was the daily devotions for the  days sometimes i would read them several times during the day throughout the fast i felt gods favor my worship time  church was deeper songs and scripture stood out and thrilled me i continue to eat the fasting foods now that ive finished the fast but have added lean meatsfish and coconut milk this book has been a lifechanger for me i recommend it highly it will change your life for the best to give god glory and to take care of his temple was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate darian greeley co age  gender male  stars out of  a
