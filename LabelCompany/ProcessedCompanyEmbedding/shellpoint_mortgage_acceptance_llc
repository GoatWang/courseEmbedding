 theoffering preoffering review of the mortgage loans introduction the sponsor prior to including the mortgage loans in the mortgage pool conducted a review for the purpose of providing reasonable assurance that the disclosure regarding the mortgage pool in this prospectus supplement is accurate in all material respects in conducting the review the sponsor engaged third parties to assist it with certain elements of the review the review conducted by the sponsor including the portions of the review conducted with the assistance of the third parties is referred to herein as the “sponsor’s preoffering review” the sponsor determined the nature extent and timing of the sponsor’s preoffering review and the level of assistance provided by any third party the sponsor does s      not attribute any of the findings and conclusions of the sponsor’s preoffering review to any of the third parties the review conducted with the assistance of third parties was conducted with respect to  of the mortgage loans included in the final mortgage pool the results of the reviews prepared by the third parties were shared with the underwriter the underwriter reviewed these findings in connection with its preparation for the offering of the offered certificates the sponsor’s preoffering review included a credit and compliance component and a component consisting of a review of the independent appraisals of the mortgaged properties obtained by the originators in connection with the origination of the mortgage loans referred to herein as the “original appraisals” as more fully described below none of the procedures conducted as part of the sponsor’s preoffering review constituted either separately or in combination an independent underwriting of the mortgage loans in addition the procedures conducted as part of the review of the original appraisals were not reappraisals of the mortgaged properties to the extent that valuation tools were used as part of the appraisal review process they should not be relied upon as providing an assessment of value of the mortgaged properties comparable to that which an appraisal might provide they also are not an assessment of the current value of any of the mortgaged properties the sponsor’s preoffering review also included a component consisting of procedures designed to verify the sponsor’s data regarding the characteristics of the mortgage loans which data were used to generate the numerical information about the mortgage pool included in this prospectus supplement in addition the review included the recalculation by a third party of numerical disclosures regarding the mortgage loans selected by the sponsor and appearing in this prospectus supplement see “—limitations of the pre offering review process ” below and “ risk factors—preoffering review of the mortgage loans underlying the certificates may not reveal aspects of the mortgage loans which could lead to losses ” for additional information regarding the limitations of the sponsor’s preoffering review credit and compliance component of sponsor’s preoffering review describe nature of review and findings appraisal component of sponsor’s preoffering review describe nature of review and findings mortgage loan characteristics component of sponsor’s preoffering review describe nature of review and findings limitations of the preoffering review process as noted above under the risk factor captioned “ preoffering review of the mortgage loans underlying the certificates may not reveal aspects of the mortgage loans which could lead to losses ” there can be no assurance that the sponsor’s preoffering review uncovered all relevant factors relating to the origination of the mortgage loans their compliance with applicable law and regulation and the original appraisals relating of the mortgaged properties or uncovered all relevant factors that could affect the future performance of the mortgage loans the mortgage loans that were included in the preoffering review may have characteristics that were not discovered noted or analyzed as part of the preoffering review that could nonetheless result in those mortgage loans failing to perform in the future s      investors are encouraged in particular to note the following with respect to the appraisal review that was conducted as part of the sponsor’s preoffering review •          differences may exist among and between estimated valuations due to the subjective nature of estimated valuations and appraisals particularly between different appraisers estimating valuations or performing appraisals at different points in time as well as among appraisers and other persons reviewing the appraisals or other valuations •          estimating or appraising the value of and performing other analyses of highcost properties such as most of the mortgaged properties can involve challenges that may not generally be present with respect to properties whose values fall within the average price range of their respective markets there may be fewer substitute properties available from which to derive comparative values in the highcost residential property market unique buyer attitudes and preferences and more difficult to quantify “appeal” issues any of which can make valuations in the highcost home segment less precise than for more averagepriced housing •          estimates of value for highcost properties such as the abovedescribed are imprecise the unique nature of some of these properties the use in some cases of highly customized and topquality materials overall interior designappeal issues and in many cases limited notations in the original appraisal report regarding key elements that drove the original property valuation pose challenges for a subsequent reviewer also the reviewer or the preparer of an limited desktop appraisal analysis does not typically have independent access to an interior inspection of the property and therefore is not able to independently analyze the interior appointments and amenities associated with the valuation of these types of properties •          appraisals and other valuations represent the analysis and opinion of the person performing the appraisal or valuation at the time it is prepared and are not guarantees of and may not be indicative of the present or future value of the mortgaged property investors are encouraged to make their own determination as the extent to which they place reliance on the limited loan review procedures carried out as part of the sponsor’s preoffering review static pool information static pool information with respect to mortgage loans similar to the mortgage loans of the issuing entity is attached as annex a to this prospectus supplement the depositor does not have any material static pool information with respect to any mortgage loans of the same type as those included in the trust estate originated by the originator there can be no assurance that the rates of delinquencies losses and prepayments experienced by the prior securitized pools will be comparable to delinquencies losses and prepayments expected to be experienced by the

metro areas and as may otherwise be authorized on a casebycase basis by senior management full documentation income employment and assets new penn’s underwriting standards require full documentation and verification of a borrower’s income employment and assets to determine whether the borrower reasonably can be expected to be able to repay the mortgage loan this determination is based on the borrower’s income sources employment history and past credit experience which must be commensurate with the loan request for example information on the borrower’s credit report must corroborate information on the application prudent underwriting and analysis of credit and loan characteristics may warrant requests for additional information or documentation if information is inconsistent eg occupancy employment income etc the mortgage loan may be declined but in any case additional information is gathered to understand the inconsistency compensating or additional supporting information disclosed in the file may be taken into consideration all files must include the completed initial application the documentation submitted by the borrower in connection with an application must have been dated within  days of the closing of the mortgage loan the underwriting standards provide for salariedwage earners selfemployed borrowers and borrowers who are on a fixed income or who earn nontaxable income eg social security income retirement or pension income alimony child support foster care payments etc to qualify the borrower’s income must be from a source likely to generate sufficient income to repay the debt and must demonstrate consistency such that the amounts and sources used to qualify the borrower are reasonably s      expected to remain stable and continue each source of income must also be reviewed with regard to the borrower’s ability to meet his or her total debt obligation varying types and levels of income documentation may be necessary for different types of income and loan programs generally if a borrower’s income can be verified as received for a reasonable time period ie one or more years and is likely to continue for at least three more years based upon the totality of the circumstances the income may be used as qualifying income employment must be stable to qualify a borrower generally showing at least a two year history in the same job or jobs in the same or related field selfemployed borrowers must be in the same business and the same field for the most recent four years although two years may be considered if the borrower has been in the same field for four years other circumstances may also be acceptable on a casebycase basis as long as the borrower demonstrates sufficient employment stability for example a borrower who changes jobs to advance within the same line of work may receive favorable treatment if this advancement can be verified however job changes without advancement or in different fields of work are reviewed carefully to ensure consistent or increasing income levels and the likelihood of continued stable employment additionally borrowers are generally required to explain in writing any job gaps that exceed one month and borrowers who reenter the workforce with less than a twoyear employment history must have been employed with their current employer for a minimum of six months and provide a fully documented previous employment history a borrower must also provide evidence of sufficient funds for the down payment closing costs and reserves when applicable the fiscal position of the borrower including accumulation of verifiable assets is a strong indication of creditworthiness an established pattern of savings demonstrates skill in financial management evidence that the savings are liquid also strengthens the loan transaction as these funds are readily available to repay debt obligations pay unexpected expenses and provide protection against short term interruption of income core and investor mortgage loans allow certain assets to be used for income qualification and do not require these assets to be withdrawn for this purpose different assets are subject to different formulas as provided under the underwriting standards if an asset is being used in the calculation of any other type of income eg dividends interest capital gains etc the asset must be excluded from the “assets for income” calculation assets do not qualify for income calculations for foreign national borrowers for foreign national borrowers generally a minimum of  months’ piti liquid reserves is

of controls and requirements in verifying income and employment for nonselfemployed borrowers generally new penn requires independent written verification of employment from the employer’s human resources department or an officer or owner of the company along with the most recent three months of pay stubs any w submitted as proof of income or employment must contain all schedules be computergenerated or typewritten and accompanied by an irs form t signed by the borrower additional validity checks are done on all submitted documentation s      the underwriting standards generally provide for a conservative approach in calculating income when income is declining or inconsistent requiring further documentation and review if the decline or inconsistency cannot be shown to be isolated or nonrecurring in nature then the lowest annual compensation over the year period prior to the date of loan application is used to qualify the borrower assuming consistency of income can be established if the borrower is paid on an hourly basis or does not work a regular  hour work week throughout the year the borrower’s income generally must be averaged over the minimum employment history required if there is an indication of declining income the current income is used instead of the average assuming consistency of income can be established bank statements whether business or personal are generally not allowed as income verification for foreign national mortgage loans the underwriting standards permit salaried retired and selfemployed borrowers salaried borrowers must provide a letter from their employer stating current monthly salary and yeartodate earnings as well as two months of valid pay stubs although pay stubs may be waived if i the borrower is not employed within the united states ii the employer does not provide pay stubs and iii alternative proof of employment is provided that is satisfactory under the underwriting standards new penn employs several controls and verification processes to ensure the accuracy and validity of the letter and other income and employment documentation generally tax returns filed in foreign countries are not required and an executed irs form t is not required if the borrower is not required to file united states tax returns selfemployed foreign national borrowers are eligible under the underwriting standards but borrowers generally must show selfemployment for a minimum of four years unearned income is generally not counted as qualifying income but may be considered on a casebycase basis while core mortgage loans and investor mortgage loans allow income from a nonus source to be considered only if such income is paid by a corporate entity and is not subject to tax in any jurisdiction outside of the us reasonable exceptions to this requirement are allowable under the foreign national program a verbal or electronic verification of employment a “voe” is required for each core and core plus product mortgage loan for nonself employed borrowers a verbal voe must be obtained within  calendar days of funding new penn employs controls to ensure the validity of the voe if the borrower has seasonal

and that the borrower worked for that business as stated on the loan application is required for selfemployed borrowers new penn requires submission of contact and other identifying information

mortgage loans new penn may in its discretion accept income and employment verification reports via approved thirdparty verification services on a casebycase basis in lieu of standard income and employment documentation but will maintain the same philosophical approach embedded in the underwriting standards and document any exceptions to the underwriting standards s      asset verification

institution is also required to prove assets among other information the letter must contain a description of the type of relationship between the borrower and the institution and how the accounts are held new penn employs controls to ensure the validity of all such information the verification of assets including the source of funds for all core and core plus product mortgage loans generally may
