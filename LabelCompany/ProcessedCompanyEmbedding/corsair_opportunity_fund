conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision or provisions of the act or from any rule or regulation under the act if and to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section c of the act provides in relevant part that no registered closedend investment company shall purchase securities of which it is the issuer except a on a securities exchange or other open market b pursuant to tenders after reasonable opportunity to submit tenders given to all holders of securities of the class to be purchased or c under such other circumstances as the commission may permit by rules and regulations or orders for the protection of investors section c provides that the commission may issue an order that would permit a closedend investment company to repurchase its shares in circumstances in which the repurchase is made in a manner or on a basis that does not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class or classes of securities to be purchased section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person acting as principal from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the commission issues an order permitting the transaction in reviewing applications submitted under section d and rule d the commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants v                  discussion a background in its  study entitled protecting investors a half century of investment company regulation “protecting investors” the commission’s division of investment management recognized that the act imposes a rigid classification system that dictates many important  regulatory consequences  for example the characterization of a management company as “openend” or “closedend” has historically been crucial to the determination of the degree of liquidity the fund’s shareholders will have and thus the liquidity required of the fund’s investments furthermore except as noted below there has been no middle ground between the two extremes  openend funds have offered complete liquidity to their shareholders and thus required virtually complete liquidity of the underlying investments while closedend funds have been subject to requirements that in fact restrict the liquidity they are permitted to offer their investors  under this bipolar system of regulation neither form has provided the best vehicle for offering portfolios that have substantial but not complete liquidity  in protecting investors the staff determined that given the changes in the securities market since  — in particular the emergence of semiliquid investment opportunities — it was appropriate to reexamine the classification system and its regulatory requirements the one exception to the liquidilliquid dichotomy has been the so called “primerate funds” these funds first introduced in  invest primarily in loans and provide shareholders liquidity through periodic tender offers or more recently periodic repurchases under rule c protecting investors recognized that the rigidity of the act’s classification system had become a limitation on sponsors’ ability to offer innovative products that would take advantage of the vast array of semiliquid portfolio securities currently existing  the report also noted the pioneering efforts of the prime rate funds and the market success they had experienced  the report thus concluded that it would be appropriate to provide the opportunity for investment companies to “chart new territory” between the two extremes of the openend and closedend forms consistent with the goals of investor protection  the division of investment management thus recommended giving the industry the ability to employ new redemption and repurchasing procedures subject to commission rulemaking and oversight in accordance with this recommendation and shortly after protecting investors was published the commission proposed for comment a new rule designed to assist the industry in this endeavor  the commission proposed rule c which began from the closedend illiquid perspective under section c and provided flexibility to increase shareholder liquidity  sec staff report protecting investors a half century of investment company regulation  may  at   id at   id at   id at   investment co act rel no  july   the “proposing release”  through periodic repurchase offers under simplified procedures rule c was adopted in april  the prime rate funds were cited in both protecting investors and the proposing release as the prototype for the interval concept  nonetheless while the prime rate funds broke the path for innovation in this area developments since the origin of these funds make further innovation appropriate ample precedent exists for the implementation of a multiclass system and the imposition of assetbased distribution fees for which the funds seek relief  since  the commission granted relief to the following closedend investment companies to issue multiple classes of shares to impose ewcs and to impose distribution and service fees eg total income real estate fund versus capital multimanager real estate income fund llc highland capital management lp and allianz rcm global ecotrends fund b multiple classes of shares — exemptions from sections c and i under the act applicants request exemptive relief to the extent that the issuance and sale of multiple classes of shares of a fund might be deemed i to result in the issuance of a “senior security” within the meaning of section g of the act and thus be prohibited by section c of the act and ii to violate the equal voting provisions of section i of the act a registered closedend investment company may have only one class of debt and only one class of stock that is a senior security  in particular section c of the act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any registered closedend investment company    to issue or sell any senior security which is a stock if immediately thereafter such company will have outstanding more than one class of senior security which is a stock” except that “any such class of    stock may be issued in one or more series provided that no such series shall have a preference or priority over any other series upon the distribution of the assets of such registered closedend company or in respect of the payment of interest or dividends    ”  section i provides  investment co act rel no  april   the “adopting release” the commission also had proposed rule e which began from the openend complete liquidity perspective under section  of the act and permitted periodic or delayed rather than constant liquidity the commission neither adopted nor withdrew proposed rule e to applicants’ knowledge the commission has taken no further action with respect to rule e  protecting investors at  proposing release at   see total income real estate fund et al investment co act rel no  january    notice and  investment co act rel no  february   order versus capital multimanager real estate income fund llc et al investment co act rel no  june   notice and investment co act rel no  july   order highland capital management lp et al investment co act rel no  august   notice and investment co act rel no  september   order and allianz rcm global ecotrends fund et al investment co act rel no  august   notice and investment co act rel no  september      section g of the act defines “senior security” as any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness this definition also includes any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends  except as provided in subsection a of this section or as otherwise required by law every share of stock hereafter issued by a registered management company    shall be voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock provided that this subsection shall not apply    to shares issued in accordance with any rules regulations or orders which the commission may make permitting such issue the multiclass system proposed herein may result in shares of a class having priority over another class as to payment of dividends and having unequal voting rights because under the proposed system i shareholders of different classes would pay different distribution fees and related costs as described above different administrative fees and any other incremental expenses that should be properly allocated to a particular class and ii each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class applicants believe that the implementation of the proposed multiclass system will enhance shareholder options  under a multiclass system an investor can choose the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase the length of time the investor expects to hold his or her shares and other relevant circumstances  the proposed arrangements would permit a fund to facilitate both the distribution of its securities and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder services by contrast if a fund were required to organize separate investment portfolios for each class of shares the success of the new portfolios might be limited  unless each new portfolio grew at a sufficient rate and to a sufficient size it could be faced with liquidity and diversification problems that would prevent the portfolio from producing a favorable return under the proposal owners of each class of shares may be relieved under the multiclass system of a portion of the fixed costs normally associated with investing in investment companies because these costs potentially would be spread over a greater number of shares than they would be otherwise  as a fund grows in volume of assets the investors will derive benefits from economies of scale that would not be available at smaller volumes the commission has long recognized that multiple class arrangements can be structured so that the concerns underlying the act’s “senior security” provisions are satisfied  after having granted numerous exemptive orders “multiple class exemptive orders” to openend investment companies permitting those funds to issue two or more classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio the commission adopted rule f under the act in  which now permits openend funds to maintain or create multiple classes without seeking individual exemptive orders as long as certain conditions are met  see sierra trust funds et al investment co act rel no  february   notice and investment co act rel no  march   order see also exemption for openend management investment companies issuing multiple classes of shares disclosure by multiple class and masterfeeder funds investment co act rel no  december    see investment co act rel no  february   as adopted rule f creates an exemption for mutual funds that issue multiple classes of shares with varying arrangements for the distribution of securities and the provision of services to shareholders in connection with the adoption of rule f the commission also amended rule b under the act to clarify that each class of shares must have separate b plan provisions moreover  applicants believe that the proposed closedend investment company multiple class structure does not raise concerns underlying section  of the act to any greater degree than openend investment companies’ multiple class structures  the proposed multiple class structure does not relate to borrowings and will not adversely affect a fund’s assets  in addition the proposed structure will not increase the speculative character of each fund’s shares  applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses relating to distribution and voting rights is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of shareholders applicants believe that the rationale for and conditions contained in rule f are as applicable to a closedend investment company seeking to offer multiple classes of common shares with varying distribution arrangements in a single portfolio as they are to openend funds  each fund will comply with the provisions of rule f as if it were an openend investment company including among others its provisions relating to differences in expenses special allocations of other expenses voting rights conversions and exchanges and disclosures  in fact each fund in many ways resembles an openend fund in its manner of operation and in the distribution of its common shares in particular the funds will offer their shares continuously at a price based on net asset value plus any applicable frontend load  differences among classes will as detailed above relate largely to differences in distribution arrangements  applicants note that openend and closedend funds are subject to different technical provisions governing the issuance of senior securities  however those technical differences do not appear relevant here  although closedend funds may not issue multiple classes of common shares without exemptive relief the commission has granted specific exemptive relief to similarlysituated closedend funds  provisions regulating the issuance by closedend funds of debt or preferred stock should have no bearing on an application by a closedend fund for an exemptive order permitting the issuance of multiple classes of common stock  therefore applicants propose to base the conditions under which the funds would issue multiple classes of common stock on those contained in rule f applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the assetbased distribution fees applicable to the different classes of shares of each fund in the manner described above is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders  each applicant is aware of the need for full disclosure of the proposed multiclass system in each fund’s prospectus and of the differences among the various classes and the different expenses of each class of shares offered  each fund will include in its prospectus disclosure of the fees expenses and other characteristics of each class of shares offered for sale by the prospectus as is required for openend multiclass funds under form na  applicants any action on the b plan ie trustee or shareholder approval must take place separately for each class the commission has adopted amendments to rule f that expand and clarify the methods by which a multiple class fund may allocate income gains losses and expenses and that clarify the shareholder voting provisions of the rule  see versus capital multimanager real estate income fund llc supra note  highland capital management lp supra note  and allianz rcm global ecotrends fund supra note   in all respects other than classbyclass disclosure each fund intends to comply with the requirements of form  n  also note that the commission has adopted rule and form amendments to require registered openend management investment companies to disclose fund expenses borne by shareholders during the reporting period in shareholder reports and to describe in their prospectuses any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination of sales loads  each fund will include these disclosures in its shareholder reports and prospectus each fund will comply with any requirements that the commission or finra may adopt regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of openend investment company shares and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to each fund in addition each fund will contractually require that any distributor of the fund’s shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of such fund’s shares in june  the commission adopted enhanced fee disclosure requirements for fund of funds including registered funds of hedge funds applicants will comply with all such applicable disclosure requirements the requested relief is similar to the exemptions discussed above granted by the commission to the total income real estate fund versus capital multimanager real estate income fund llc highland capital management lp and allianz rcm global ecotrends fund  accordingly applicants believe there is ample precedent for the implementation of a multiclass system c early withdrawal charge rule c under the act permits an interval fund to make repurchase offers of between five and twentyfive percent of its outstanding shares at net asset value at periodic intervals pursuant to a fundamental policy of the interval fund rule cb requires an interval fund to repurchase shares at net asset value and expressly permits the interval fund to deduct from repurchase proceeds only a repurchase fee not to exceed two percent of proceeds that is paid to the interval fund and is reasonably intended to compensate the fund for expenses directly related to the repurchase  shareholder reports and quarterly portfolio disclosure of registered

capital multimanager real estate income fund llc supra note  highland capital management lp supra note  and allianz rcm global ecotrends fund supra note   applicants seek relief from this requirement of rule cb to the extent necessary for the funds to impose ewcs on shares submitted for repurchase that have been held for less than a specified period the funds may seek to impose ewcs that are the functional equivalent of the cdsls that openend investment companies may charge under rule c under the act the funds intend to assess ewcs in much the same way noninterval funds currently assess ewcs as more fully described below these charges would be paid to the distributor and are functionally similar to cdsls imposed by openend funds relief to permit the imposition of ewcs would be consistent with the approach the commission has taken with respect to cdsls imposed by openend funds which offer their securities continuously as the initial fund does for its common shares any ewc imposed by the funds will comply with rule c under the act as if the rule were applicable to closedend funds in the adopting release the commission stated that “the requirement of rule cb that repurchases take place at net asset value and the limitation of repurchase fees to two percent implicitly preclude the imposition” of cdsls  the commission stated however that even though it was not proposing any provisions regarding the use of cdsls by interval funds such consideration may be appropriate after the commission considers whether to adopt proposed rule c which would permit the imposition of cdsls by openend companies and has the opportunity to monitor the effects of the nasd sales charge rule upon distribution charges of openend companies which goes into effect in july of  since adopting rule c the commission has adopted rule c that rule adopts a flexible approach and permits openend funds to charge cdsls as long as i the amount of the cdsl does not exceed a specified percentage of net asset value or offering price at the time of the purchase ii the terms of the sales load comply with the provisions of the nasd sales charge rule governing sales charges for openend funds and iii deferred sales loads are imposed in a nondiscriminatory fashion scheduled variations or elimination of sales loads in accordance with rule d are permitted rule c is grounded in policy considerations supporting the employment of cdsls where there are adequate safeguards for the investor these same policy considerations support imposition of ewcs in the interval fund context and are a solid basis for the commission to grant exemptive relief to permit interval funds to impose ewcs with respect to the policy considerations supporting imposition of ewcs as the commission recognized when it promulgated rule c several noninterval funds that had been making periodic repurchase offers to their shareholders imposed early withdrawal charges comparable to cdsls  traditional closedend funds which do not regularly offer to  adopting release rule cb provides in pertinent part the company shall repurchase the stock for cash at net asset value determined on the repurchase pricing date    the company may deduct from the repurchase proceeds only a repurchase fee not to exceed two percent of the proceeds that is paid to the company for expenses directly related to the repurchase  id  adopting release section iiac section c does not require that repurchases be made at net asset value  repurchase shares do not generally impose ewcs although nothing in the act would preclude them from doing so section c of the act does not regulate the price at which shares may be purchased in a tender offer when a closedend fund continuously offers its shares at net asset value and provides its shareholders with periodic opportunities to tender their shares however the fund’s distributor like the distributor of an openend fund may need to recover distribution costs from shareholders who exit their investments early moreover like openend funds interval funds need to discourage investors from moving their money quickly in and out of the fund a practice that imposes costs on all shareholders neither the proposing release nor the adopting release suggests that the purpose underlying rule cb’s requirements that repurchases take place at net asset value is to preclude interval funds from imposing ewcs rather its purpose is to prohibit funds from discriminating among shareholders in prices paid for shares tendered in a repurchase offer the best price rules under rule ca of the act and rule efii of the exchange act address this same concern the commission staff does not construe those rules to forbid closedend funds making repurchase offers under section c from imposing ewcs there is in applicants’ view no rational basis to apply rule cb’s requirements differently  moreover each fund will be treating all similarly situated shareholders the same each fund will disclose to all shareholders the applicability of the ewcs and any scheduled waivers of the ewc to each category of shareholders and as a result no inequitable treatment of shareholders with respect to the price paid in a repurchase offer will result each fund also will disclose ewcs in accordance with the requirements of form na concerning contingent deferred sales charges as required by rule c for openend funds each fund relying on the order will comply with shareholder service and distribution fee limits imposed by the nasd sales charge rule on the same basis as if it were an openend investment company in this regard a fund will pay service and distribution fees pursuant to plans that are designed to meet the requirements of the nasd sales charge rule on the same basis as if it were an openend investment company subject to that rule the commission has previously granted the same type of exemptive relief requested herein  in each case the commission granted relief from rule cb to an interval fund to charge ewcs to certain shareholders who tender for repurchase shares that have been held for less than a specified period d waivers of ewcs  see proposing release section iia adopting release section iia  see adopting release section iiac recognizing that several closedend funds making periodic repurchases pursuant to section c impose early withdrawal charges  see versus capital multimanager real estate income fund llc supra note  highland capital management lp supra note  and allianz rcm global ecotrends fund supra note   each fund may grant waivers of the ewcs on repurchases in connection with certain categories of shareholders or transactions established from time to time each fund will apply the ewc and any waivers or scheduled variations of the ewc uniformly to all shareholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule d under the act as if the funds were openend investment companies the shares that benefit from such waivers are less likely to be the cause of rapid turnover in shares of a fund particularly where there are also important policy reasons to waive the ewc such as when shares are tendered for repurchase due to the death disability or retirement of the shareholder events such as death disability or retirement are not likely to cause high turnover in shares of a fund and financial needs on the part of the shareholder or the shareholder’s family are often precipitated by such events the ewc may also be waived in connection with a number of additional circumstances including the following repurchases of shares held by employer sponsored benefit plans i repurchases to satisfy participant loan advances ii repurchases in connection with distributions qualifying under the hardship provisions of the internal revenue code of  and iii repurchases representing returns of excess contributions to such plans furthermore if a distributor has not incurred significant promotional expenses by making upfront payments to selling dealers in connection with attracting shareholders in a particular category to the fund the waiver of the ewc works to shareholders’ advantage while not harming the distributor economically in adopting amended rule d in february  the commission recognized that the adoption of rule c to “require forward pricing of fund shares largely dispelled concerns about share dilution” furthermore “the sales load variations that have been instituted through rules d through d and exemptive orders prior to february  have improved the competitive environment for the sale of fund shares without disrupting the distribution system for the sale of those shares”  in light of these circumstances the commission believed that “it is appropriate to permit a broader range of scheduled variation” as permitted in amended rule d  rule d permits openend funds to sell their shares at prices that reflect scheduled “variations in or elimination of the sales load to particular classes of investors or transactions” provided that the conditions of the rule are met when rule d was adopted the status of cdsls for openend funds and waivers of those charges were not covered by any rule and were the subject of exemptive orders rule c permitting cdsls for openend funds adopted in april  permits scheduled variations in or elimination of cdsls for a particular class of shareholders or transactions provided that the conditions of rule d are satisfied  the same policy concerns and competitive benefits applicable to scheduled variations in or elimination of sales loads for openend funds are applicable to interval funds and the same safeguards built into rules d and c that protect the shareholders of openend funds will protect the  investment co act rel no  february    id  rule d requires that the scheduled variations in or elimination of the sales load must apply uniformly to all offerees in the class specified and the company must disclose to existing shareholders and prospective investors adequate information concerning any scheduled variation revise its prospectus and statement of additional information to describe any new variation before making it available to purchasers and advise existing shareholders of any new variation within one year of when first made available  shareholders of interval funds so long as interval funds comply with those rules as though applicable to interval funds applicants submit that it would be impracticable and contrary to the purpose of rule c to preclude interval funds from providing for scheduled variations in or elimination of ewcs subject to appropriate safeguards e assetbased distribution and service fees applicants request relief from the provisions of section d of the act and rule d thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the funds to impose assetbased distribution fees in a manner analogous to rule b fees for an openend investment company section b of the act and rule b thereunder do not apply to closedend investment companies accordingly no provisions of the act or the rules thereunder explicitly limits the ability of a closedend fund to impose a distribution fee section d of the act prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person acting as principal from effecting any transaction in which such registered company is a joint or a joint and several participant in contravention of commission regulations rule d provides that no joint transaction covered by the rule may be consummated unless the commission issues an order upon application in reviewing applications pursuant to section d and rule d the commission considers whether an investment company’s participation in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants section d of the act is intended to prevent or limit abuses arising from conflicts of interest however section d itself does not prohibit any specific activities but instead authorizes the commission to approve rules to limit or prevent an investment company from being a joint participant on a different or less advantageous basis than other participants under rule d it is unlawful for an affiliated person acting as principal to participate in or effect any transaction in connection with a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which the investment company is a participant without prior commission approval the protections provided for in section d essentially allow the commission to set standards for all transactions concerning an investment company and an affiliate which could be construed as selfdealing or involve overreaching by the affiliate to the detriment of the investment company the protections developed and approved by the commission for openend investment companies in rule b will be complied with by each fund in connection with its plan with respect to each class of shares as if the fund were an openend management investment company therefore the funds will participate in substantially the same way and under substantially the same conditions as would be the case with an openend investment company  applicants do not concede that section d applies to the assetbased distribution fees discussed herein but requests this exemption to eliminate any uncertainty  imposing distribution fees under rule b  applicants note that at the same time the commission adopted rule b it also adopted rule d to provide an exemption from section d and rule dl to the extent necessary for arrangements between openend funds and their affiliated persons or principal underwriters or affiliated persons of such persons or principal underwriters whereby payments are made by the openend fund with respect to distribution if such agreements are entered into in compliance with rule bl in its adopting release the commission stated as follows the commission wishes to emphasize that it has no intention of categorizing certain transactions as raising the applicability of section d and rule d of the act  the commission’s only comment is that to the extent that arrangements in which a fund pays for its distribution costs could involve the fund in a ‘joint enterprise’ with an affiliated person and if such arrangements were entered into in compliance with rule b the commission sees no need for prior commission review and approval of the arrangements as closedend management investment companies the funds may not rely on rule d  however in light of the foregoing applicants believe any section d concerns the commission might have in connection with a fund’s financing the distribution of its shares should be resolved by the fund’s undertaking to comply with the provisions of rules b and d as if those rules applied to closedend investment companies accordingly the funds will comply with rules b and d as if those rules applied to closedend investment companies  the funds represent that the funds’ imposition of assetbased distribution fees is consistent with factors considered by the commission in reviewing applications for relief from section d of the act and rule d thereunder ie that the imposition of such fees as described is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and does not involve participation on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants vi               applicants’ condition applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition each fund relying on the order will comply with the provisions of rules c b d f d and where applicable a under the act as amended from time to time as if those rules applied to closedend management investment companies and will comply with the nasd sales charge rule as amended from time to time as if that rule applied to all closedend management investment companies vii            conclusion for the reasons stated above applicants submit that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and are consistent with the protection of investors  see bearing of distribution expenses by mutual funds investment co act rel no  october    id  and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants further submit that the relief requested pursuant to section c will be consistent with
