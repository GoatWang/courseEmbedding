there will be bumps in the road as he tightens train schedules and puts into place new plans aimed at making the railroad leaner faster and more profitable the caution in a conference call on csxs strong secondquarter earnings comes as the company is already seeing freight shipments slow down the wsjs paul ziobro reports with some shippers reporting longer transit times and surveyed assessments of csx service declining the barbs that mr harrison has favored costcutting over service have followed the veteran rail executive at other stops and he dismisses that as an unjust perception the effort is already improving csxs financial results and mr harrison insists that after a little pain and suffering the railroads network will work better for shippers as well trade talks starting next

supply chains hasnt been all sunny the enormous textile industry has had disruptions as traders adjust and some businesses are hunkering down as they get paperwork in order but the fragmented and inefficient logistics industry is already counting financial gains and a projected  savings in logistics costs could spur more shipping once the new tax system becomes clearer transportation the legal
