developed markets stocks view all posts prior to the evolution of exchangetraded funds etfs the way most investors obtained exposure to oil was via energy stocks oil is one of the most heavily traded commodities and issuers of etps have seized upon that theme by bringing to market a scores of nonequity oil products over the years that includes the united states oil fund lp etf nysearcauso the uso which tracks frontmonth west texas intermediate futures is the king of futuresbased oil etfs issuer us commodity funds gives the long explanation of the fund “the investment objective of uso is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ nav to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light sweet crude oil delivered to cushing oklahoma as measured by the daily changes in price of uso’s benchmark oil futures contract less uso’s expenses … uso invests primarily in listed crude oil futures contracts and other oilrelated futures contracts and may invest in forwards and swap contracts these investments will be collateralized by cash cash equivalents and us government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less” the short version when you buy uso you’re not really buying oil per se there’s no barrel that you can collect by turning in your etf units the  best etfs to buy for the rest of  but you’re still more closely investing in oil than you can through energy stocks like exxon mobil corporation nysexom or schlumberger limited nyseslb as you’re invested in the same futures contracts that many pros and bigger investors use to invest in oil uso big but not perfect the uso etf is home to more than  billion in assets under management making it one of the largest commodities funds in america with average daily volume of  million shares which works out to be about  billion in dollar terms uso is also one of the most heavily traded commodities funds underscoring the professional community’s use of this products however neither of those factors mean uso is a perfect investment far from it although uso is not a leveraged oil etf it still comes with one of the same disclaimers the longer you hold it the bigger your potential for disappointment see because it constantly rolls over derivatives and futures exposure not only are its costs high  per year or more than triple the average etf’s yearly fee but that constant rolling mean the fund can and does deviate from the price of spot crude the etf’s “method is particularly sensitive to shortterm changes in spot prices but can also result in heavy roll costs that makes uso a great vehicle for riding shortterm moves in crude prices but longterm holders may want to look at other options” according to etfcom simply put if spot oil prices jump  in a year it’s unlikely that uso will sport a comparable gain the long and short of investing in this fund is that it’s an imperfect way to invest in oil but as far as faithful methods go retail investors like you and i have few options anyway this etf is an imperfect proxy but it hasn’t drawn in assets for nothing either more from investorplace vaneck vectors gold miners etf gdx the quick guide to gdx dgaz the

nyseuso from tyler durden oil jumped this morning with brent rising  trading above  after the international energy agency said opec had achieved record initial compliance of  with planned production cuts – it is unclear how much of this was selfreported and questionable – while demand grew faster than expected in the first month of opec’s supply cut agreement key member saudi arabia reduced production by  or even more than it had committed despite venezuela’s struggles to reduce output it had achieved only  of planned cuts while higher demand is aiding the group’s bid to rebalance world markets the iea said the following bloomberg chart shows alleged deal compliance by nation… … and the detailed breakdown is shown below the iea which advises industrial nations on energy policy said that if current compliance levels are maintained the global oil stocks overhang that has weighed on prices should fall by about  barrels per day bpd in the next six months the iea also estimated that  producers including russia kazakhstan pumped k bd less crude in january versus octobernovember levels citing preliminary data the iea also increased its  estimates for world oil demand growth for a third month and boosted its outlook for  anticipating an increase of  million barrels a day this year world oil inventories will fall by  barrels a day during the first half of the year if opec sticks to its agreement the iea said oil has fluctuated above  a barrel since a deal to trim output between opec and  other nations took effect on jan  us producers are taking advantage of higher prices by increasing drilling activity and boosting daily output to the highest level since april a dynamic the iea said is capping prices in the mids “there is a demand element to this price rise as well as opec compliance” says michael hewson market analyst at cmc markets “we’re still short of the highs of the month” “the key question for the oil market is how long opec can sustain this deal” spencer welch a director at ihs energy said by email “historic analysis of similar production limits suggests that  percent compliance is unlikely” while the oil market welcomed the data which may or may not be accurate as verification remains problematic and recent surges in inventory suggest quite the opposite of what the iea reports increasingly more attention has recently fallen on us crude production especially in light of a recent surge in permian drilling rigs… … which threatens to disrupt the much desired supplydemand equilibrium the united states oil fund lp etf nyseuso was trading at  per
