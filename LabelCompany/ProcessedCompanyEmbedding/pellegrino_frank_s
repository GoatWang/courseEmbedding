go for illicit booze and general debauchery during the prohibition years 9 when notorious chicago gangster and bootlegger al capone was imprisoned in 9 and prohibition repealed the next year the speakeasy lost its lustre among the city’s thrill seekers more than  years later that spirit has been revitalised in the pursuit of hushhush culinary delights this has led to the development of a blossoming underground dining scene where food lovers gather by wordofmouth in unconventional locations to celebrate creative expression through food these underground experiences aren’t advertised or

dietl looks back on his friend’s life by melissa mccart feb   pm est tweet share pin frank pellegrino sr’s restaurant rao’s nick solares frank pellegrino sr  died of cancer yesterday he was the owner and the heart of rao’s the storied east harlem restaurant that’s the hardest table to get in new york “rao’s will never be rao’s without frankie” says bo dietl his closest friend and former nypd detective who helped catch the son of sam founder of beau dietl  associates — and now new york city mayoral candidate open since 96 the restaurant was founded by the rao family when vinnie rao died he willed his ownership of the restaurant to his wife anna pellegrino rao frank’s aunt dietl says he met pellegrino in 9 as a detective in the neighborhood when pellegrino was a bartender in the family restaurant then a waiter then the maitre d’ by 9 frankie gave dietl his own table — “the big table toward the front” he says that gift is why it’s so hard to get a table at rao’s there are no reservations just table assignments designated decades ago by pellegrino sr and his aunt anna shortly after dietl got his table mimi sheraton gave the restaurant threestars from the new york times and a neighborhood restaurant that was often crowded became a destination restaurant that was impossible to get into — unless you knew someone since then “anyone who’s anyone” has sat at that table from warren buffett to bill gates bruce willis tommy mottola and mariah carey “when they first met” denzel washington and leonardo dicaprio who was filmed eating in the restaurant for the wolf of wall street pellegrino’s role in the restaurant landed him a role in martin scorsese’s goodfellas as well as an fbi chef on “the sopranos” dietl shared acting roles also in goodfellas along with the wolf of wall street in which he played himself when his aunt died in the 9s pellegrino inherited the restaurant along with his cousin ron straci with whom he since had a storied dispute even with the opening of restaurants in las vegas and la — as well as the raos product line of pasta sauces and olive oil — rao’s has not lost luster which many attribute to pellegrino that’s because there’s been no renovation or overhaul with the exception of repairs after a fire in the 9s rao’s remained as it has been with black and white football photos and frank sinatra memorabilia on the walls dino gatto — who cooks for the giants for sunday home games — runs the kitchen serving familystyle plates of lemon chicken meatballs and eggplant parmesan thursdays has been the night to go a night that pellegrino was sure to be there “he is and was the catalyst of the restaurant” dietl says “we lost a little piece of new york when we lost frankie yesterday” pellegrino is survived by his son and
