sinking fund if any for the preferred stock   · whether the shares of the series of preferred stock will be listed on a securities exchange   · whether interests in the preferred stock will be represented by depositary shares   · the transfer agent for the series of preferred stock   · any special united states federal income tax considerations applicable to the series and   · any other preferences and rights and any qualifications limitations or restrictions of the preferences and rights of the series   limitations on liability and indemnification of officers and directors   the bca authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors and officers to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors’ fiduciary duties  our second amended and restated articles of incorporation include a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law   our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by applicable law  we are also expressly authorized under our amended and restated bylaws to advance certain expenses including attorneys’ fees and disbursements and court costs to our directors and officers and carry directors’ and officers’ insurance providing indemnification for our directors officers and certain employees for some liabilities  we believe that these indemnification provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers   the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties  these provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers even though such an action if successful might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders  in addition your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions   anti‑takeover effects of certain provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws   several provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws which are summarized below may have anti‑takeover effects these provisions are intended to avoid costly takeover battles lessen our vulnerability to a hostile change of control and enhance the ability of our board of directors to maximize shareholder value in connection with any unsolicited offer to acquire us however these anti‑takeover provisions could also discourage delay or prevent  the merger or acquisition of us by means of a tender offer a proxy contest or otherwise that a shareholder may consider in its best interest and  the removal of incumbent officers and directors   limited actions by shareholders   our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by our shareholders must be effected at an annual or special meeting of shareholders or by the unanimous written consent of our shareholders our second amended and restated    table of contents articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that subject to certain exceptions our chairman president or secretary at the direction of the board of directors or our secretary at the request in writing by any one or more shareholders that hold in the aggregate at least a majority of the outstanding registered shares of the corporation entitled to vote may call special meetings of our shareholders the business transacted at the special meeting is limited to the purposes stated in the notice advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and director nominations   our amended and restated bylaws provide that shareholders seeking to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of their proposal in writing to the corporate secretary generally to be timely a shareholder’s notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than  days nor more than  days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders our amended and restated bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder’s notice these provisions may impede shareholder’s ability to bring matters before an annual meeting of shareholders or make nominations for directors at an annual meeting of shareholders   selling shareholders   in october  we entered into stock purchase agreements the “purchase agreements” with the selling shareholders
