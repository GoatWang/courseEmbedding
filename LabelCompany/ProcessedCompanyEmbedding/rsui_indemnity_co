may have two or more different meanings  to determine if an insurer has a duty to defend or indemnify a claim asserted against a policy holder the court will look to the allegations in the underlying complaint to decide whether the action against the policy holder states a claim covered by the policy  an insurer s duty to defend generally is broader than its duty to indemnify  an insurer s duty to defend is triggered where the factual allegations in the underlying complaint potentially support a covered claim  where there exists some doubt as to whether the complaint against the insured alleges a risk insured against that doubt should be resolved in favor of the insured  the duty to defend is broad if even one count or theory of plaintiff s complaint lies within the coverage of the policy

contends that the toney lawsuit is related to the prior lawsuits and therefore the toney lawsuit is not a claim first made during the policy period rsui argues that coverage is barred by section v conditions paragraph b which provides in part all claims based on arising out of directly or indirectly resulting from in consequence of or in any way involving the same or related facts circumstances

first made when the earliest of such claims is first made     the policy period ran from march   through march   the toney lawsuit was filed on july   within the policy period the prior lawsuits were filed before the policy period rsui argues that the court should use a broad interpretation of the phrases arising out of and or in any way involving to find that the toney lawsuit is related to the prior lawsuits the delaware supreme court found that the term arising out of is broadly construed to require some meaningful linkage between the two conditions imposed in the contract  the united states court of appeals for the first circuit found that the or in any way involving clause is a mopup clause intended to exclude anything not already excluded by the other clauses   pacific sun ins co v liberty mut ins co  ad   del   clark school for creative learning inc v philadelphia indem ins co  fd   st cir   the court recognizes the precedent instructing broad interpretation of these clauses however the facts alleged in toney are different from those in the prior lawsuits in toney an outbound call was made from an autodialer to ms toney s cellular telephone which was listed on the national do not call registry the underlying facts in the prior lawsuits as alleged at the time the toney lawsuit was filed would not give rise to a cause of action under the tcpa rsui relies on united westlabs inc et al v greenwich insurance co et al in support of its position that the toney lawsuit is related to the prior lawsuits and therefore cannot be considered as a claim first made within the policy period in westlabs this court applied an interrelated claims provision to bar coverage where the subsequent claim was asserted against additional defendants who were officers of the original defendant corporation and included new causes of action and alleged conduct united westlabs inc  uwl  sought insurance coverage from two insurers for liability and expenses stemming from uwl s dispute with seacoast laboratory data systems  seacoast   uwl commenced arbitration with seacoast in january  alleging breach of contract  seacoast counterclaimed   wl  del super  id  id at   id at

court for the central district of california asserting that seacoast breached the march  settlement agreement seacoast filed counterclaims   counterclaims  adding two uwl officers as defendants  the court found the wrongful acts giving rise to the  and  counterclaims were fundamentally identical  both involve a breach of the    agreement claim a claim for copyright infringement or hacking and the same facts circumstances situations transactions and events  the insurance policy at issue in westlabs contained an interrelated claims provision stating all claims arising from interrelated wrongful acts shall be deemed to constitute a single claim and shall be deemed to have been made at the  id  id  id at   id  id at   id at   earliest time at which the earliest claim is made      the court found that seacoast s  and  counterclaims arose from interrelated wrongful acts and therefore the counterclaims were treated as a single claim made in january   the court found that coverage was barred because the claims were deemed to have been made before the inception of uwl s policies with both insurers westlabs is distinguishable from this case the underlying wrongful acts in westlabs which gave rise to the  and  counterclaims were fundamentally identical and arose from a dispute among the same parties  the court is not persuaded that the facts in this case are analogous or warrant a similar finding the court finds that the prior lawsuits are not related to the toney lawsuit the prior lawsuits all arise out of a plaintiff contacting a thirdparty product vendor and in that same transaction the third party enrolls the plaintiff in and initiates billing for membership in a sempris membership program in contrast ms toney placed an online order she subsequently was contacted by quality resources a thirdparty telemarketer unlike the prior lawsuits both claims in toney are tcpa claims it is this initiation of contact from an autodialer to ms  id  id at   id  id at   toney s cellular telephone listed on the national do not call registry which gave rise to the toney lawsuit further ms toney never was enrolled in a sempris membership program separating her from the fraudbased claims of the prior lawsuits the date the toney lawsuit is deemed to have been filed is not affected by the prior lawsuits the toney lawsuit was filed within the policy period and falls within the insuring agreement exclusions do not apply to bar coverage for the toney lawsuit the court finds that sempris met its burden to prove the claim falls within the insuring agreement the burden then shifts to rsui to demonstrate that an exception applies to bar coverage the prior notice exclusion does not apply to bar coverage rsui has not shown that the prior notice exclusion bars coverage for the toney lawsuit the prior notice exclusion bars coverage for a claim alleging arising out of based upon or attributable to directly or indirectly the same or essentially the same facts underlying or alleged in any matter which prior to the inception date of this policy has been the subject of notice to any insurer of a claim     as previously discussed the court finds that the toney lawsuit is based on alleged tcpa violations and does not arise out of the prior lawsuits  first bank of del inc v fidelity  dep co of maryland  wl  at  del super  the court has distinguished the prior lawsuits which arise out of allegedly fraudulent enrollment in sempris membership programs initiated through contact from the consumer the endorsement entitled exclusion specific does not apply to bar coverage rsui fails to demonstrate that the endorsement entitled exclusion specific bars coverage the exclusion specific provides that rsui shall not be liable to make any payment for loss arising out of or in connection with any claim    made against the insured alleging arising out of based upon or attributable to directly or indirectly relating to the prior lawsuits as discussed above the court finds the toney lawsuit does not arise out of the prior lawsuits the unfair trade practices exclusion does not apply to bar coverage rsui fails to show that coverage is barred by the unfair trade practices exclusion the exclusion bars coverage for actual or alleged violation of any law    with respect to any of the following activities    unfair trade practices or tortuous interference in another s business or contractual relationships the court finds that the exclusion is limited to another s business or contractual relationships the court finds that the alleged tortious interference with an individual at issue in toney is not within the scope of the unfair trade practices exclusion  the professional services exclusion does not apply to bar coverage rsui fails to demonstrate that the professional services exclusion applies to bar coverage the exclusion bars coverage for any claim made against any insured alleging arising out of based upon or attributable to    the performance or rendering of or failure to perform professional services     to qualify as professional services as defined in the policy services must be undertaken for others for a fee the complaint merely states as the company whose products and services are being sold budget savers sempris and their clients reap the benefit of these sales calls similarly in the prior lawsuits the complaints do not allege that fees were paid for professional services based on the record the only fees generated here are the membership fees consumers pay to sempris the toney claim alleges that quality resources made calls at the direction of sempris there is no suggestion in the complaint that sempris provided professional services to others for a fee therefore this exclusion is not applicable to the facts in the toney lawsuit conclusion no genuine issue of material fact exists that would prevent the court from granting summary judgment sempris has met its burden to prove the toney lawsuit falls within the policy s grant of coverage the court finds that the toney lawsuit arising from alleged violations of the tcpa is not related to the prior  lawsuits the court finds that rsui has failed to prove that any exception exists that bars coverage for the toney lawsuit counts ii iii iv v and vi are not dismissed as requested by rsui the court finds that rsui has a duty to defend sempris in the underlying toney lawsuit therefore rsui s motion for summary judgment is hereby denied sempris motion for partial summary judgment is hereby granted it is so ordered s mary m johnston the honorable

coverage dispute arises out of a lawsuit filed against sempris llc dba budget savers “sempris” the underlying suit sarah toney et al v quality resources inc et al “toney lawsuit” is pending in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois rsui indemnity company “rsui” issued a directors and officers liability policy to sempris bearing policy number nhp “policy” the effective policy period ran from march   through march   the maximum aggregate limit of liability under the policy is  sempris paid a premium of  for the policy sempris tendered the toney lawsuit to rsui for coverage under the policy rsui has denied that it owes a duty to defend or a duty to indemnify sempris for the toney lawsuit rsui is an insurance company organized under new hampshire law with its principle place of business in atlanta georgia sempris is a delaware corporation with its principle place of business in minnesota the toney lawsuit is a putative class action alleging two claims under the telephone consumer protection act “tcpa”  usc §  count i – tcpa – do not call registry – alleges that the defendants made unsolicited telemarketing phone calls to the plaintiff and the class in violation of the tcpa   case no cv nd ill  usc § c and  cfr § c  count ii – tcpa – autodialed calls to cell phones – alleges that the defendants made improper calls to the plaintiff and others’ cellular telephones using an automatic telephone dialing system andor artificial or prerecorded voice in violation of the tcpa  usc § b and  cfr § a  rsui filed this action on october   seeking a declaratory judgment that rsui owes no insurance coverage obligations to sempris or provell inc fka budget savers “provell” sempris is currently the sole defendant  on february   rsui filed a motion for summary judgment also on february   sempris filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that rsui has a duty to defend sempris against the underlying toney claim rsui seeks summary judgment on count ii “no claim first made during the policy period” count iii “section iv exclusions paragraph  precludes coverage for the toney lawsuit” count iv “the endorsement titled ‘exclusion – specific’ precludes coverage for the toney lawsuit” count v “section iv  joint stipulation of material facts “jsf” ex a ¶   jsf ex a ¶   the parties entered into a joint stipulation and order regarding count i “provell is not an insured under the rsui policy” of the complaint the parties agreed that provell is not an insured under the policy and is not entitled to a defense or indemnity under the policy  exclusions paragraph b precludes coverage for the toney lawsuit” and count vi “the endorsement entitled ‘exclusion – professional errors and omissions’ precludes coverage for the toney lawsuit” of its complaint for declaratory judgment rsui is also seeking summary judgment on sempris’ counterclaims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment standard of review summary judgment is granted only if the moving party establishes that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and judgment may be granted as a matter of law  all facts are viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party  summary judgment may not be granted if the record indicates that a material fact is in dispute or if there is a need to clarify the application of law to the specific circumstances  when the facts permit a reasonable person to draw only one inference the question becomes one for decision as a matter of law  if the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof at trial yet “fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case” then summary judgment may be granted against that party   super ct civ r c  hammond v colt indus operating corp  ad   del super   super ct civ r c  wootten v kiger  ad   del   celotex corp v catrett  us     where the parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment and have not argued that there are genuine issues of material fact “the court shall deem the motions to be the equivalent of a stipulation for decision on the merits based on the record submitted with the motions” neither partys motion will be granted unless no genuine issue of material fact exists and one of the parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law analysis contract interpretation the parties agree that delaware law applies to this dispute  insurance contracts “are construed as a whole to give effect to the intention of the parties” where the language of an insurance policy is “clear and unambiguous the parties’ intent is ascertained by giving the language its ordinary and usual meaning”  where the language in an insurance policy is ambiguous it is construed in favor of the insured a contract is ambiguous when the provisions at issue “are  super ct civ r h  emmons v hartford underwriters ins co  ad   del   jsf ¶   att corp v faraday capital ltd  ad   del   id  weiner v selective way ins co  ad   del super   reasonably or fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different meanings” to determine if an insurer has a duty to defend or indemnify a claim asserted against a policy holder “the court will look to the allegations in the underlying complaint to decide whether the action against the policy holder states a claim covered by the policy”  an insurer’s duty to defend generally is broader than its duty to indemnify  an insurer’s duty to defend is triggered “where the factual allegations in the underlying complaint potentially support a covered claim” “where there exists some doubt as to whether the complaint against the insured alleges a risk insured against that doubt should be resolved in favor of the insured”  the duty to defend is broad “if even one count or theory of plaintiff’s complaint lies within the coverage of the policy the duty to defend arises”   id  virtual bus enter llc v maryland

months of membership the suit alleges violations of the michigan consumer protection act the electronic funds transfer act fraud by omission and unjust enrichment • the toney lawsuit was filed on october   the toney lawsuit alleges that after ms toney placed an online order for stompeez children’s  herman v sempris llc cv wd mich  slippers she received several calls on her cellular telephone from quality resources inc “quality resources” to verify her order information quality resources is a third party telemarketer the telephone calls at issue were allegedly made using an automated

tried to sell ms toney sempris’ budget savers goods andor services  ms toney was never charged for membership in a sempris program the toney lawsuit alleges two violations of the tcpa the toney lawsuit falls within the insuring agreement the parties agree that the toney lawsuit meets the definition of a claim under the policy and reflects alleged wrongful acts as defined by the policy  the toney lawsuit is not related to the prior lawsuits rsui argues that toney does not meet the requirements of the insuring agreement the insuring agreement provides coverage “if a claim for a wrongful act is first made against the insured organization during the policy  jsf ex a ¶¶   jsf ex a ¶   jsf ex a ¶¶    jsf ex a ¶   jsf ¶   period    ” rsui contends that the toney lawsuit is related to the prior lawsuits and therefore the toney lawsuit is not a claim first made during the policy period rsui argues that coverage is barred by section v conditions paragraph b which provides in part all claims based on arising out of directly or indirectly resulting from in consequence of or in any way involving the same or related facts circumstances situations transactions or events or the same or related series of circumstances transactions or events shall be deemed to be a single claim for all purposes under this policy    and shall be deemed first made when the earliest of such claims is first made     the policy period ran from march   through march   the toney lawsuit was filed on july   within the policy period the prior lawsuits were filed before the policy period rsui argues that the court should use a broad interpretation of the phrases “arising out of” and “or in any way involving” to find that the toney lawsuit is related to the prior lawsuits the delaware supreme court found that “the term ‘arising out of’ is broadly construed to require some meaningful linkage between the two conditions imposed in the contract”  the united states court of appeals for the first circuit found that “the ‘or in any way involving’ clause is a mopup clause intended to exclude anything not already excluded by the other clauses”   pacific sun ins co v liberty mut ins co  ad   del   clark school for creative learning inc v philadelphia indem ins co  fd   st cir   the court recognizes the precedent instructing broad interpretation of these clauses however the facts alleged in toney are different from those in the prior lawsuits in toney an outbound call was made from an autodialer to ms toney’s cellular telephone which was listed on the national do not call registry the underlying facts in the prior lawsuits as alleged at the time the toney lawsuit was filed would not give rise to a cause of action under the tcpa rsui relies on united westlabs inc et al v greenwich insurance co et al in support of its position that the toney lawsuit is related to the prior lawsuits and therefore cannot be considered as a claim first made within the policy period in westlabs this court applied an “interrelated claims” provision to bar coverage where the subsequent claim was asserted against additional defendants who were officers of the original defendant corporation and included new causes of action and alleged conduct united westlabs inc “uwl” sought insurance coverage from two insurers for liability and expenses stemming from uwl’s dispute with seacoast laboratory data systems “seacoast”  uwl commenced arbitration with seacoast in january  alleging breach of contract  seacoast counterclaimed   wl  del super  id  id at   id at   alleging breach of contract and copyright infringement “ counterclaims”  uwl brought a claim against seacoast in the united states district court for the central district of california in february  uwl subsequently obtained insurance policies from two insurers uwl did not disclose its dispute with seacoast to the insurers in december  uwl brought claims against seacoast in united states district court for the central district of california asserting that seacoast breached the march  settlement agreement seacoast filed counterclaims “ counterclaims” adding two uwl officers as defendants  the court found the wrongful acts giving rise to the  and  counterclaims were “fundamentally identical” “both involve a breach of the    agreement claim a claim for copyright infringement or ‘hacking’ and the same facts circumstances situations transactions and events”  the insurance policy at issue in westlabs contained an interrelated claims provision stating “all claims arising from interrelated wrongful acts shall be deemed to constitute a single claim and shall be deemed to have been made at the  id  id  id at   id  id at   id at   earliest time at which the earliest claim is made    ”  the court found that seacoast’s  and  counterclaims arose from interrelated wrongful acts and therefore the counterclaims were treated as a single claim made in january   the court found that coverage was barred because the claims were deemed to have been made before the inception of uwl’s policies with both insurers westlabs is distinguishable from this case the underlying wrongful acts in westlabs which gave rise to the  and  counterclaims were fundamentally identical and arose from a dispute among the same parties  the court is not persuaded that the facts in this case are analogous or warrant a similar finding the court finds that the prior lawsuits are not related to the toney lawsuit the prior lawsuits all arise out of a plaintiff contacting a thirdparty product vendor and in that same transaction the third party enrolls the plaintiff in and initiates billing for membership in a sempris membership program in contrast ms toney placed an online order she subsequently was contacted by quality resources a thirdparty telemarketer unlike the prior lawsuits both claims in toney are tcpa claims it is this initiation of contact from an autodialer to ms  id  id at   id  id at   toney’s cellular telephone—listed on the national do not call registry—which gave rise to the toney lawsuit further ms toney never was enrolled in a sempris membership program separating her from the fraudbased claims of the prior lawsuits the date the toney lawsuit is deemed to have been filed is not affected by the prior lawsuits the toney lawsuit was filed within the policy period and falls within the insuring agreement exclusions do not apply to bar coverage for the toney lawsuit the court finds that sempris met its burden to prove the claim falls within the insuring agreement the burden then shifts to rsui to demonstrate that an exception applies to bar coverage the prior notice exclusion does not apply to bar coverage rsui has not shown that the prior notice exclusion bars coverage for the toney lawsuit the prior notice exclusion bars coverage for a claim “alleging arising out of based upon or attributable to directly or indirectly the same or essentially the same facts underlying or alleged in any matter which prior to the inception date of this policy has been the subject of notice to any insurer of a claim    ” as previously discussed the court finds that the toney lawsuit is based on alleged tcpa violations and does not “arise out of” the prior lawsuits  first bank of del inc v fidelity  dep co of maryland  wl  at  del super  the court has distinguished the prior lawsuits which arise out of allegedly fraudulent enrollment in sempris membership programs initiated through contact from the consumer the endorsement entitled “exclusion – specific” does not apply to bar coverage rsui fails to demonstrate that the endorsement entitled “exclusion – specific” bars coverage the exclusion – specific provides that rsui “shall not be liable to make any payment for loss arising out of or in connection with any claim    made against the insured alleging arising out of based upon or attributable to directly or indirectly relating to” the prior lawsuits as discussed above the court finds the toney lawsuit does not arise out of the prior lawsuits the unfair trade practices exclusion does not apply to bar coverage rsui fails to show that coverage is barred by the unfair trade practices exclusion the exclusion bars coverage “for actual or alleged violation of any law    with respect to any of the following activities    unfair trade practices or tortuous interference in another’s business or contractual relationships” the court finds that the exclusion is limited to “another’s business or contractual relationships” the court finds that the alleged tortious interference with an individual at issue in toney is not within the scope of the unfair trade practices exclusion  the professional services exclusion does not apply to bar coverage rsui fails to demonstrate that the professional services exclusion applies to bar coverage the exclusion bars coverage for any “claim made against any insured alleging arising out of based upon or attributable to    the performance or rendering of or failure to perform professional services    ” to qualify as “professional services” as defined in the policy services must be “undertaken for others for a fee” the complaint merely states “as the company whose products and services are being sold budget savers sempris and their clients reap the benefit of these sales calls” similarly in the prior lawsuits the complaints do not allege that fees were paid for professional services based on the record the only fees generated here are the membership fees consumers pay to sempris the toney claim alleges that quality resources made calls at the direction of sempris there is no suggestion in the complaint that sempris provided professional services to others for a fee therefore this exclusion is not applicable to the facts in the toney lawsuit conclusion no genuine issue of material fact exists that would prevent the court from granting summary judgment sempris has met its burden

company inc plaintiff v vision one llc et al defendants united states district court wd washington seattle february   order granting in part defendants motion for summary judgment robert s lasnik district judge this matter comes before the court on the motion by vision one and berg equipment for lifting of stay and for certain rulings based on outcome of rsuis state court appeal dkt   in february  the court stayed this case pending the outcome of plaintiff rsui indemnity company incs rsui appeal of the state court decision that the underlying settlement agreement between defendants vision one llc vision one and berg equipment  scaffolding co inc berg collectively defendants was reasonable the court of appeals of the state of washington affirmed the trial courts reasonableness determination and issued its mandate on august   notice dkt   on october   the court held a status conference during which the court granted defendant vision ones request to lift the stay and based on the parties agreement allowed the parties to submit additional briefing regarding vision ones motion for summary judgment regarding damages the court described the background facts underlying this matter in the courts order on cross motions regarding coverage dkt   it will not repeat those facts here vision one seeks summary judgment that the presumptive measure of rsuis liability in this case is  million the value of the settlement between vision one and berg in the underlying litigation rsui opposes vision ones motion on the basis that there must be a finding of bad faith before the presumptive value of the damages may exceed the limits of the underlying insurance policy the court having reviewed the memoranda supporting documents and the remainder of the record grants in part and denies in part vision ones motion ii analysis a summary judgment standard summary judgment is appropriate when viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party the records show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law fed r civ p a the party seeking summary dismissal of the case bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion celotex corp v catrett  us    and identifying those portions of the materials in the record that show the absence of a genuine issue of fact fed r civ p c once the moving party has satisfied its burden it is entitled to summary judgment if the nonmoving party fails to designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial celotex corp  us at  the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving partys position is not sufficient triton energy corp v square d co  fd   th cir  summary judgment should be granted where the nonmoving party fails to offer evidence from which a reasonable jury could return a verdict in its favor tw elec serv inc v pac elec contractors assn  fd   th cir  b presumptive damages under washington law an insured defendant may independently negotiate a settlement if the insurer declines in bad faith to participate in the liability action and then seek recovery from the insurer in a bad faith action besel v viking ins co  wnd    the presumptive measure of damages in the bad faith action is the settlement amount as long as the settlement is reasonable and not the product of fraud or collusion id this type of settlement agreement often called a covenant judgment includes three features  a stipulated or consent judgment between the plaintiff and the insured  a plaintiffs covenant not to execute on that judgment against the insured and  an assignment to the plaintiff of the insureds coverage and bad faith claims against the insurer bird v best plumbing group llc  wnd    pd   en banc rsui opposes vision ones request for presumptive damages first on the basis that presumptive damages are not appropriate in this case because berg and therefore vision one as bergs assignee has not been harmed by the underlying litigation response dkt   at  however washington courts have repeatedly rejected this argument finding that an agreement not to execute does not preclude a showing of harm besel  wnd at  alteration in original quoting safeco ins co of am v butler  wnd    a covenant not to execute coupled with an assignment and settlement agreement is not a release permitting the insurer to escape its obligation kagel v aetna life  cas co  wnapp    second rsui contends that even if presumptive damages are appropriate in this case the amount of the presumed damages cannot exceed the  million limit of bergs policy with rsui absent a finding of bad faith response at  vision one relying primarily on mut of enumclaw ins co v tg const inc  wnd   argues that this courts earlier finding of coverage under the rsui policy and the recent appellate court decision affirming the trial courts reasonableness finding mandate a finding that the presumptive measure of rsuis liability in this case is  million the settlement value motion dkt    in tg construction the insurance company defended the insured in the liability case but neglected to participate in the final round of settlement negotiations tg construction  wnd at  the parties settled for  million and the insurance company challenged the reasonableness of the settlement the trial court found the settlement reasonable but later reduced the settlement to  million on the insurers motion for reconsideration in a separate coverage action the insurer objected to paying the amount of the settlement contending that the policy only obligated it to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of   property damage and the insurer believed that the insured should have prevailed on an affirmative defense id at  quotations omitted the washington supreme court disagreed finding that when the insurer had an opportunity to be involved in a settlement fixing the insureds liability and that settlement is judged reasonable by a judge then it is appropriate to use the fact of settlement to establish liability and the amount of settlement as the presumptive damage award for purposes of coverage id at  here there is no indication that the covenant judgment was the product of fraud or collusion and the state appellate court recently upheld the lower courts finding that it was reasonable the court therefore finds that presumptive damages are appropriate in this case having found that damages may be presumed in this case the court now must determine the amount of presumptive damages unlike the present case tg construction did not involve a covenant judgment that exceeded the insureds policy limits vision one concedes that tg construction does not expressly address the circumstances presented here but it concludes that the washington supreme court nevertheless intended its holding in that case to apply to situations in which the covenant judgment is higher than the insureds policy limits reply dkt   at  the court disagrees in tg construction the court extended its earlier decision in besel that a covenant judgment in the liability case establishes the presumptive damages in subsequent bad faith actions to situations in which the insurer did not act in bad faith in besel the court expressly required a finding of bad faith before allowing the insured to recover more than the policy limits besel  wnd at  because the insurer acted in bad faith it is liable for the entire amount of the settlement the court reassured insurers that they can avoid this extreme result by acting in good faith id furthermore in tg construction the court refers to situations in which a plaintiff may recover more than the policy limits to distinguish certain coverage issues from those present in the case before it the court in a footnote affirmed the appellate courts finding that coverage by estoppel is only applicable when the insurer acts in bad faith and therefore did not apply to the case before it in making this distinction the court explained that further coverage by estoppel will require the insurer to pay all damages regardless of policy limits tg construction  wnd at  n that the court expressly distinguished the present coverage issues from those involving bad faith and coverage by estoppel by that doctrines ability to reach beyond the insureds policy limits suggests that the court did not intend its holding to apply to situations in which the covenant judgment exceeds the policy limits see id in addition to relying on tg construction vision one recommends that the court follow the reasoning of a  new hampshire case lawton v great southwest fire ins co  nh   ad   however lawton does not support the broad ruling that vision one seeks in lawton the new hampshire supreme court determined that an insureds breach of contract claim seeking damages in excess of his insurance policy limits survives a motion to dismiss lawton  nh at  on the defendants motion to dismiss the court held that the plaintiff may be able to recover damages in addition to the policy limits not that he was entitled to such damages id whether the insurers delay was in fact in bad faith whether the damages alleged to have resulted from the delay were in fact foreseeable and whether these damages could have been avoided with reasonable efforts by the insured are questions for the jury lawton does not stand for the proposition that an insured is presumptively entitled to damages exceeding the policy limits based on a covenant judgment consistent with lawton this courts decision does not preclude an award of damages greater than  million despite this courts earlier ruling that rsui did not act in bad faith by making an unreasonable coverage determination vision one may still be able to establish rsuis bad faith based on its failure to investigate order dkt   at  which could enable vision one to recover more than the policy limits besel  wnd at  the principles in butler do not depend on how an insurer acted in bad faith rather the principles apply whenever an insurer acts in bad faith whether by poorly defending a claim under a reservation of rights refusing to defend a claim or failing to properly investigate a claim citations omitted vision ones bad faith claim based on rsuis failure to investigate and postdenial conduct remain for trial and thus vision one may pursue the additional  million but it must establish that rsui acted in bad faith before it will be entitled to such damages the court therefore grants in part vision ones motion to set the amount of rsuis presumptive liability above the express policy limits c prejudgment interest in addition to seeking presumptive damages equal to the total covenant judgment vision one argues that it is entitled to prejudgment interest at the rate of  per year since the date of the reasonableness hearing in the underlying superior court case motion at  rsui contends that the amount rsui owes vision one if anything is not liquidated and therefore there is no justification for prejudgment interest response at  a party is entitled to prejudgment interest where the amount due is liquidated prier v refrigeration engg co  wnd    a claim is liquidated where the evidence furnishes data which if believed make it possible to compute the amount due with exactness without reliance on opinion or discretion id even if the claim is disputed it may still be liquidated weyerhaeuser co v commercial union ins co  wnd    quoting prier  wnd at  rsui argues that even if the covenant judgment sets the presumptive measure of damages in this case the presumptive amount of damages is not liquidated because it constitutes some indeterminate amalgamation of putative contract and tort damages response at  however the washington court of appeals has addressed a similar situation in an action concerning indemnification for a settlement in an underlying case see king cnty v puget sound power  light co  wnapp   in puget sound power the trial court interpreted an indemnity agreement to require the defendant to fully reimburse the plaintiff for the earlier settlement with a third party and the court ordered the defendant to pay prejudgment interest from the date of the settlement puget sound power  wn app at  the appellate court upheld the trial courts award of prejudgment interest stating that a claim for a definite sum due to the plaintiff is still liquidated although the facts upon which the claim is based may be disputed and even though the adversary successfully challenges the amount and succeeds in reducing it  in short it is the character of the claim and not of the defense that is determinative of the question whether an amount of money sued for is a liquidated sum id at  emphasis in original quoting prier  wnd at  as the washington supreme court stated in prier the award of prejudgment interest has been based upon the view that one who has had the use of money owing to another should in justice make compensation for its wrongful detention prier  wn d at  having determined that coverage existed and that the presumptive measure of damages is the policy limit the court finds that the amount vision one seeks to recover is a liquidated sum and therefore vision one is entitled to prejudgment interest having found that vision one is entitled to prejudgment interest the court must determine the applicable rate even if vision one is entitled to prejudgment interest on a liquidated amount rsui contends the applicable rate is the rate set forth in rcw b for tort claims not  percent id at  vision one argues that the rates in rcw  apply to postjudgment interest not prejudgment interest and the applicable rate is  percent per year as described in rcw  reply at  contrary to vision ones argument washington courts use rcw  to determine the applicable prejudgment interest rate unigard ins co v mut of enumclaw ins co  wnapp    therefore the relevant inquiry is whether rcw b or rcw  applies to this case rcw b setting interest rate for tort claims rcw  catch all provision setting the interest rate for judgments not described elsewhere in statute at  a mixed judgment a judgment based on more than one type of claim is subject to only one interest rate unigard  wn app at  to determine which interest rate is the controlling interest rate courts examine the components of the final judgment to determine the primary basis of the judgment and therefore the most applicable interest rate woo v firemans fund ins co  wnapp    while the court finds that the presumptive amount of damages in this case is  million the court is not in a position to determine the applicable prejudgment interest rate because the components of the final judgment are unknown vision ones bad faith claims and related cpa claims remain for trial order dkt   the court therefore grants in part vision ones request for prejudgment interest and declines to set the rate until each component of the judgment is known iii conclusion for all the foregoing reasons the court grants in part and denies in part vision ones motion regarding damages dkt   the court grants vision ones request to set the presumptive value of damages and denies vision ones request to set the presumptive value of damages above bergs policy limits the presumptive measure of damages in this case is  million the court grants vision ones request for prejudgment interest but declines to set the rate until the full extent of the damages is determined footnotes  vision one requests for the first time in its reply that the court certify to the washington supreme court the question of whether a covenant judgment can set the presumptive damages above the policy limits absent a finding of bad faith reply at  the court is not persuaded that the law in this case is either unascertainable or not clearly determined therefore the court declines to certify the issue comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit or remove comments but is under no
