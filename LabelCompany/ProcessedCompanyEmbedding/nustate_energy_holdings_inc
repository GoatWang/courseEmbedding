gpstrax is the universal technology that turns any car into a ‘smart car”   how it works our technology works on any car manufactured since  allowing us to access car sensors through the governmentmandated open obdii port   gpstrax relies on lowcost hardware that can be purchased at any number of manufactures and can be easily selfinstalled under the dashboard and paired via bluetoothwifi to a smartphone storing data in the cloud   competitors there are four startup companies automatic zubie mojio and dash with similar platforms that have collectively raised over m from venture capitalists in silicon valley each of the four have similar business models the companies are not differentiated in their platforms underlying technology or focus   nustate’s edge automatic zubie mojio and dash all focus on basic smart car technology onstar is a proprietary technology used only on cars that gm produces and a few “aftermarket” cars they sell   focus sets nustate apart while gpstrax can do everything the competition can do and more our focus is different also onstar is proprietary to gm gpstrax can work on any car  or newer almost anywhere in the world   focused market segments smart car technology the kyoto protocol  merc – established market the internet of things “iot” – massive market   smart car technology the gpstrax adapter plugs into just about any car which unlocks the data hidden in a car’s onboard computer the free mobile app pairs with the adapter via bluetooth to diagnose engine problems display trip logs and mileage and even call for help in a crash in addition the basic alerts such as engine light diagnostics time and location triggers parts and labor estimator mpg analytics and ways to reduce gas costs trip tracking and more   the kyoto protocol  merc  the kyoto protocol adapted by the united nations and is a trading system that essentially makes carbon credits a commodity like oil or gas on a worldwide scale merc is the process of converting the mobile emissions reduction into a tradable commodity that consists of converting the reduction or a portion of the reduction of emissions into at least one tradable credit then marketing and monetizing the credit gpstrax is the only software solution that focuses on this market sector   nustate is poised to move into markets via our licensing agreement with the ronn motor group our first partner in this segment through our exclusive licensing agreement with rmg ronn maxwell ceo of ronn motor groups is targeting the commercial and original equipment fleet vehicle markets in china india and europe according to ronn maxwell “gpstrax is an important tool for validating testing and trucking or stationary platform”   the internet of things iot iot arguably nustate’s largest sector is the “network of physical objects or things” embedded with electronics software sensors and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data gpstrax has a proprietary algorithm which uses a variety of driver safetyefficiency metrics to generate valuable data that is stored in the cloud this can be compared to google or facebook with the only difference being the data is specific to the automotive aftermarket which is projected to be  billion dollars in  just in the us   experts agree that the total iot could add us  trillion dollars in accumulative gdp for several economies over the next  years gpstrax is on the forefront worldwide accumulative marketable data through telematics nustate has significant potential to offer predictive timely contextual convenient and simple data to the automotive aftermarket service providers worldwide   according to gartner  million connected vehicles will enable new invehicles services and automate driving capabilities by  making connected cars one of the largest and most valuable segments of the internet of things iot   nustate’s team has more experience than the other four companies regarding fleet management emission tricking fuel efficiency and most importantly offers an inside opportunity for the smart investor not sitting in silicon valley         nseh current price volume bid ask days range

organization going concern and basis of presentation   organization   nustate energy holdings inc  or the company currently is a florida corporation that was incorporated in nevada in october  it was formerly known as jaguar investments inc between october  and may  powership inc between may  and november  and fittipaldi logistics inc between november  and december    going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis the company had net cash used in operating activities of  during the six months ended december   and had a working capital deficit of approximately  million at december   these matters raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due to fund possible future acquisitions and to generate profitable operations in the future management plans to provide for the company’s capital requirements by continuing to issue additional equity and debt securities the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that if achieved the company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating results the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   basis of presentation   the unaudited interim financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring items which in the opinion of management are necessary to fairly state nustate energy holdings inc’s the “company” or “we” “us” or “our” financial position results of operations and cash flows for the dates and periods presented and to make such information not misleading certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america have been omitted pursuant to rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” nevertheless management of the company believes that the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading   these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited financial statements for the year ended june   contained in the company’s annual report on form ka filed with the sec on october  the results of operations for the six months ended december   are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other interim period or the fiscal year ending june     note  summary of significant accounting policies   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reporting amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period actual results will differ from those estimates included in these estimates are assumptions used in blackscholes valuation methods such as expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend rate   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid temporary cash equivalents with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents the company had no cash equivalents during the six months ended december   and    concentration of credit risks   the company is subject to a concentration of credit risk from cash   the company’s cash account is held at a financial institution and is insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic up to  during the six months ended december   and  the company had not reached a bank balance exceeding the fdic insurance limit   derivative liabilities   the company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of december   and  which consist of convertible instruments and rights to shares of the company’s common stock and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for liability classification under asc    asc  generally provides three criteria that if met require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments these three criteria include circumstances in which a the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract b the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and c a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of asc  asc  also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as described      nustate energy holdings inc notes to unaudited financial statements december     note  summary of significant accounting policies continued   during the six months ended december   and  the company had notes payable outstanding in which the conversion rate was variable and undeterminable accordingly the company has recognized a derivative liability in connection with such instruments the company uses judgment in determining the fair value of derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and at every balance sheet thereafter and in determining which valuation method is most appropriate for the instrument eg blackscholesmerton the expected volatility the implied risk free interest rate as well as the expected dividend rate if any   fair value of financial instruments   the company accounts for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures or asc  asc  establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements   asc  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date additionally asc  requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs these inputs are prioritized below   level  observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities     level  observable marketbased inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data     level  unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions   the company’s derivative liability at december   and  is classified as level  financial instrument   additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements   the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents other receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses accrued compensation note and convertible promissory notes payable and liabilities from discontinued operations approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these items   convertible instruments   the company accounts for convertible instruments when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments in accordance with asc  debt with conversion and other options accordingly the company records when necessary discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption the company also records deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note   asc  contracts in entity’s own equity generally provides that among other things if an event is not within the entity’s control such contract could require net cash settlement and shall be classified as an asset or a liability   the company determines whether the instruments issued in the transactions are considered indexed to the company’s own stock during the fiscal year  the company issued convertible securities with variable conversion provisions that resulted in derivative liabilities   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of asc  “accounting for income taxes” which requires among other things an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes the asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized   the company follows the provisions of asc  “accounting for uncertain income tax positions” when tax returns are filed it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained in accordance with the guidance of asc  the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which based on all available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination the company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination as such the company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits      nustate energy holdings inc notes to unaudited financial statements december     note  summary of significant accounting policies continued   income taxes continued   the company has adopted asc  “ definition of settlement”  which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished for tax positions considered effectively settled an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open as of december   the company had not filed tax returns for the tax years ending june   through  and such returns when filed potentially will be subject to audit by the taxing authorities for a minimum of three years beyond the filing date under the threeyear statute of limitations the company has not accrued any potential tax penalties associated with not filing these tax returns due to recurring losses management believes such potential tax penalties in any would not be material in amount   sharebased payment   the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensationstock compensation or asc  under the fair value recognition provisions of this topic stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is the vesting period   the company has elected to use the blackscholesmerton or bsm optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of its options which incorporates various subjective assumptions including volatility riskfree interest rate expected life and dividend yield to calculate the fair value of stock option awards compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures asc  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates   segment reporting   the company operates in one segment which is to search for possible acquisition targets and merge with an operating company the company’s chief operating decisionmaker evaluates the performance of the company based upon expenses by functional areas as disclosed in the company’s statements of operations   recent accounting pronouncements   recent accounting pronouncements have been issued but deemed by management to be outside the scope of relevance to the company   as an emerging growth company we have elected to use the exemption provided for in the jumpstart our business startups act or jobs act allowing us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies pursuant to section b of

compared with the prior year is primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation and accounting expense offset by lower salaries and consulting fees   we believe that our selling general and administrative expenses will continue at their current rate as we continue to focus our resources on the search for a business opportunity for the remainder of  should we begin merger or acquisition procedures we believe that our selling general and administrative expenses will substantially increase   change in fair value of derivative liabilities       threemonths ended             sixmonths

expense represents stated interest of notes and convertible notes payable as well as amortization of debt discount we believe that our interest expense will continue at the same levels as the first six months of  for the remainder of fiscal    gain on restructuring of debt   during the three and six months ended december   the company recognized a gain as a result of the exchange of accrued

our total assets consisted of cash   we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures   the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have ready access to sufficient funds to meet commitments and effectively implement our growth strategy our primary sources are financing activities such as the issuance of notes payable and convertible notes payable in the past we have mostly relied on debt and equity financing to provide for our operating needs   we cannot ascertain that we have sufficient funds from operations to fund our ongoing operating requirements through june   we may need to raise funds to enhance our working capital and use them for strategic purposes if such need arises we intend to generate proceeds from either debt or equity financing   we intend to finance our operations using a mix of equity and debt financing we do not anticipate incurring capital expenditures for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will need to raise approximately  per year in the near term to finance the recurring costs of being a publiclytraded company in the longterm we anticipate we will need to raise a substantial amount of capital to complete an acquisition we are unable to quantify the resources we will need to successfully complete an acquisition if these funds cannot be obtained we may not be able to consummate an acquisition or merger and our business may fail as a result   during the six months ended december   we have taken aggressive steps to strengthen the balance sheet by successfully exchanging debt held by our noteholders for shares of our series a and series b preferred stock at substantial discounts to the face value of the notes payable we have been able to do this because the noteholders have agreed that this is a necessary step to provide the company an opportunity to successfully execute on its business plan   going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis the company has used net cash in its operating activities of approximately  and  during the sixmonth periods ended december   and  respectively and has a working capital deficit of approximately  million and  million at december   and june   respectively the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due to fund possible future acquisitions and to generate profitable operations in the future once a merger with an operating company is consummated management plans may continue to provide for its capital requirements by issuing additional equity securities and debt and the company will continue to find possible acquisition target the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that if achieved the company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or
