bain capital public equity  bain capital credit  appraisals and critiques  investments gallery  references  bibliography  external links historyedit  founding and early historyedit bain capital was founded in  by bain  company partners mitt romney t coleman andrews iii and eric kriss after bill bain had offered romney the chance to head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket in brighton massachusetts the fastgrowing retail chain went public in  by  the company had grown to over  stores and as of fiscal year end january  staples reached over  billion in sales nearly b in net income  employees and  stores bain capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment and romney sat on the staples board of directors for over a decade another very successful investment occurred in  when  million was invested in medical equipment maker calumet coach which eventually returned  million a few years later bain capital made an investment in the technology research outfit the gartner group which ended up returning a fold gain bain invested the  million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by  was generating an annualized return in excess of  percent by the end of the decade bains second fund raised in  had deployed  million into  investments as the firm began organizing around funds each such fund was run by a specific general partnership—that included all bain capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years

capital as notorious for its failure to plow profits back into its businesses being the first large privateequity firm to derive a large fraction of its revenues from corporate dividends and other

the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket in brighton massachusetts the fastgrowing retail chain went public in  by  the company had grown to over  stores and as of fiscal year end january  staples reached over  billion in sales nearly b in

investment occurred in  when  million was invested in medical equipment maker calumet coach which eventually returned  million a few years later bain capital made an investment in the technology research outfit the gartner group which ended up returning a fold gain bain invested the  million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by  was generating an annualized return in excess of  percent by the end of the decade bains second fund raised in  had deployed  million into  investments as the firm began organizing around funds each such fund was run by a specific general partnership—that included all bain capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by the end of  bain had raised  million of capital and financed

invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million

by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing

jobs and killing the american economy josh kosman described bain capital as notorious for its failure to plow profits back into its businesses being the first large privateequity firm to derive a large fraction of its revenues from corporate dividends and other distributions the revenue potential of this strategy which may starve a company of capital was increased by a s court ruling that

kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million

source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and

jobs and killing the american economy josh kosman described bain capital as notorious for its failure to plow profits back into its businesses being the first large privateequity firm to derive a large fraction of its revenues from corporate dividends and other distributions the revenue potential of this strategy which may starve a company of capital was increased by a s court ruling that
