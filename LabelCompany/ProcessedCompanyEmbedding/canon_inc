complete peace of mind voluntary action plan based on the basic policy on product safety canon believes that one of its most important missions as a manufacturer is to provide safe products that offer peace of mind and satisfaction with this in mind we formulated a basic policy on product safety which some group companies in japan complies with moreover we have formulated a voluntary action plan for product safety based on this policy that we carry out in an effort to ensure product safety and focus on the customer we also comply fully with government laws and notices and have developed a system to report immediately in the case of an infraction such as an accident involving one of our products additionally canon inc as well as group companies in japan have formulated and are following

product safety regulations and chemical safety regulation action procedures revised a total of ten standards including injury protection safety standard and chemical emission safety standards continued to raise awareness among customers about smoke emissions from counterfeit batteries and safe handling of electric cords and plugs etc continued to implement product safety education and emphasized the importance of product safety during basic training on quality continued with updated version of elearning course for all employees to promote understanding of the voluntary action plan for product safety product safety technical standards canon regards the provision of safe products as one of the most fundamental and important missions of a manufacturer we therefore require that all canon products comply with our own product safety technical standards which take into account customer perspectives on product use as well as legally stipulated product safety standards for example we employ plastics that are more flame resistant than the law requires and we implement doubleprotection schemes for important safetyrelated components additionally we continually revise these standards based on technological advancements and environmental changes in  we revised standards pertaining to plastics and fire spread prevention taking into account such factors as the latest fireresistance performance of plastic materials and structural designs that prevent the spread of fire based on these technical standards we strictly enforce safety management at the design evaluation and manufacturing stages items not meeting these exacting standards are withheld from the market to ensure that all products meet our requirements for substantial safety substantial safety an approach to ensuring product safety that takes into account such factors as anticipated customer usage going beyond what is prescribed in legal and regulatory frameworks canons main approaches to safety technology attempt to assess injury which hypothetically might occur in a variety of operations performed by customers taking into perspective human factors for safety such as body function ability human psychologybehavior engage in joint development with manufacturers of essential safetyrelated components such as noncombustible parts and nonfail protective components and employ those meeting the requirements of canons qualification system for parts and components conduct safety confirmation testing based on abnormal voltage waveforms in commercial power supplies confirmed in regions around the world where products are sold hypothesize abnormalities such as component failure and conduct stricter safety evaluation testing than is required by the laws of each country and region quality assessment during development establishing an assessment environment for delivery of products that are safe and offer peace of mind at canon inc we have set up testing facilities compliant with official standards and relevant laws to accurately and thoroughly assess the safety of products in terms of electromagnetic radiation emi noise flame resistance ratings volatile organic compounds vocs genotoxicity and electrical safety canon inc has also obtained certification in public standards such as isoiec and ul enabling publicly certified testing to be carried out inhouse according to highly precise measurements specifically canon inc is equipped with the industrys leading testing technology including anechoic chambers for emi testing that are among the largest and best in japan a verification laboratory for testing the fire safety and ignition propensity of large products shielded rooms and semianechoic chambers for acoustic noise in addition to emc testing canon inc is able to conduct all testing necessary to apply for blue angel certification inhouse iso international organization for standardization a nongovernmental organization established in geneva switzerland in  in order to formulate international standards iec international electrotechnical commission an international standardization group that formulates standards on electrical and digital technologies standardization pertaining to the fields of electrical and digital technologies is covered by the iec and not iso the iec is based in geneva switzerland and it was established in  ul underwriters laboratories inc established in the state of illinois usa in  for the independent testing and certification of the safety of products that pass its assessment tests based on its own product safety standards established to standardize function and safety emc electromagnetic compatibility testing this consists of testing for electromagnetic interference emitted by the product or its power sources that affects the operations of other equipment as well as electromagnetic susceptibility testing which tests the susceptibility of the product itself to malfunctioning caused by electromagnetic interference in the vicinity blue angel blue angel was launched in  as the worlds first ecolabeling system and is monitored by germanys federal environmental agency the german institute for quality assurance and certification and the environmental label jury an independent decisionmaking body emi measurement of products in a semianechoic chamber flammability verification laboratory for large products concentrating quality management at the tamagawa office with its industryleading facilities in november  canon completed construction of a new building at the tamagawa office which it considers to be the central hub of its quality efforts all qualityrelated supervisory functions including evaluations management audits and planning have been consolidated at the tamagawa office as of march  our goal is to not only achieve synergy through this concentration but also to effectively utilize measurement and assessment facilities improve the accuracy of measurements and assessments and shorten the lead time for providing feedback to requesting divisions going forward we will continue to work to enhance our quality management from various perspectives the new building at the tamagawa office safety assessment initiatives safety assessments of chemical substances released from products canon assesses the chemical emissions from its printers multifunction devices projectors and other products our assessments include measurements necessary for acquisition of germanys blue angel environmental label such as benzene styrene ozone and dust as well as of vocs for which exposure limits have been set within japan or internationally we verify that emission levels meet inhouse standards which are the same or even more stringent than those set worldwide the inhouse testing laboratory carrying out these assessments has been certified as a fair and impartial test facility for applications for the blue angel mark and has received isoiec  certification from the japan accreditation board for conformity assessment carrying out measurements in compliance with isoiec  the scope of certification as an isocertified test laboratory was expanded in response to additions to the blue angel raluz  criteria calling for the measurement of ultrafine particles ufps blue angel is also considering adding ufp standards for large equipment that until now have been excluded from the standards canon responds in a timely manner to the strengthening of standards gas chromatograph mass spectrometer used to measure chemical substances emitted from products safety assessments of ink toner and other consumables canon assesses the safety and ensures the quality of its ink toner and other consumables enabling customers to use its printers and mfds with confidence for example with regard to the materials for ink and toner we carry out assessments related to genotoxicity which is thought to be closely linked to carcinogenicity using in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus tests as of august  canon has been able to test inhouse the distinctive waterinsoluble materials used in many canon products canons testing laboratories are highly reliable and have been certified by japans ministry of health labour and welfare as in compliance with the good laboratory practice glp standards in the act on the evaluation of chemical substances and regulation of their manufacture etc chemical substances control law canons laboratories also comply with glp standards set by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd furthermore canon became the first in japan to have its in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test certified as in compliance with the glp standards in the chemical substances control law good laboratory practice glp the standard for the management testing and reporting of facilities and organizations that operate as testing agencies conducting chemical substance safety assessments testing according to glp standards ensures reproducibility and data reliability glp standards set by the oecd were enacted in  and since then member countries have developed domestic laws and regulations based on these standards facilities certified as compliant under japans glp standards in the chemical substances control law must have their certification renewed every three years which involves receiving a new conformity screening prior to the expiration of the certifications validity period in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test using animal testing to assess the safety of chemicals certain laws and regulations in japan and other countries require the submission of animal testing data when assessing the safety of chemicals and in some cases animal testing is an effective means of verifying the impacts a chemical has on human health or the environment based on this background canon conducts animal testing through a thirdparty specialist institution only in cases where it cannot obtain existing data externally with regard to the chemicals used in its toners and inks and no other alternative is available this policy is stipulated in our inhouse rules on the safety of chemical products along with the three rs a basic international principle on animal testing canon will continue to gather information and conduct analysis on novel approaches and evaluation methods that do not require animal testing so that alternative forms of evaluations can be carried out the three rs a worldwide set of principles on animal testing advocated in  reduction reduce the number of animals used in testing refinement minimize the suffering of animals replacement use alternative methods to animal testing qualification system for electronic parts to ensure safety and reliability canon considers it essential to maintain and improve the quality and reliability of every component including integrated circuits and various electronic parts to ensure that products are safe and reliable consequently we built and operate a qualification system of our own design for these electronic parts when selecting parts under this system we evaluate reliability and structural soundness in accordance with standards for each category ultimately using only electronic parts that meet these standards of quality in recent years the market for electronic parts has undergone significant changes including the consolidation of semiconductor manufacturers and plant relocations despite this upheaval canon has been able to maintain consistent quality levels by utilizing this qualification system canon is also working on enhancing its technologies to keep pace with advancements in electronic parts this includes highprecision nondestructive evaluation technologies such as xray ct scans and more detailed processing and observation technologies as well as measurement technologies for higherspeed lsi xray ct scanner for evaluating the internal structure of parts the internal structure of electronic parts is made visible enabling analysis and evaluation of the structure response to software vulnerability in recent years more and more of canons multifunction devices and cameras among other products are being connected to other products via a network greatly enhancing convenience at the same time this increases information security risks including the leakage of personal information or confidential information from products connected to these networks in response to such risks canon conducts various vulnerability tests on software for networkcompatible products during development and strives to standardize companywide approaches to raising awareness about vulnerabilities and risks as well as to testing methods moreover recognizing the importance of minimizing the impact on customers when a vulnerability is found after products have been shipped we strive to share and release necessary information about any such issues in a timely manner accordingly we have established a system to investigate market trends on vulnerability including the products of other companies and to quickly share information internally to prevent similar problems from occurring in our own products in  we introduced the vulnerability assessment checksheet as a quality confirmation requirement at the time of production checks in order to prevent software vulnerabilities from past products from reoccurring this parameter sheet is now used across the company for vulnerability verification processes we have expanded network and softwarevulnerability prevention efforts to group companies and are progressing with the establishment of an informationsharing network and the sharing of testing techniques pursuing beauty and comfort to provide higherquality images and videos canon has formulated methods for quantitatively evaluating and measuring the beauty and comfort that people feel we are using these methods to develop practical tools to consistently achieve uniform highquality color reproduction from input to output moreover to make canon products more comfortable to use we have established evaluation and measurement methods to reduce physical stress placed on the consumer when using our products as part of the assessment process we carry out user tests under our inhouse monitor program in addition we have researched the auditory impact on users of sounds from product operations and ambient noise with the aim of creating the most pleasing sounds we are also developing quiet products that generate minimal operating noise evaluating physical stress placed on the body during product use user test under the inhouse monitor program aftersales support online support service in order to facilitate troubleshooting canon provides worldwide customersupport services

prompt and appropriate response including causal investigation free repairs and information disclosure we keep our customers informed about product safety as well as quality issues and remedial procedures by placing product advisory statements in various newspapers and on our website in  no product advisory statements were placed on our website in addition we established a new page for

subsidiaries in each country which serve as the contact point for the customer file a report with the quality assurance division of the respective canon inc products operations the quality assurance division then analyzes the cause of the issue and looks into countermeasures moreover in the event of a major issue related products operations as well as the quality management headquarters legal
