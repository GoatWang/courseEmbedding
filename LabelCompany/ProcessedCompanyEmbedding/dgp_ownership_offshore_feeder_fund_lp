fund share what is a masterfeeder fund a masterfeeder fund is a common structure hedge funds utilized to pool taxable and taxexempt capital raised by united states and overseas investors into a centralized vehicle known as a master fund separate investment vehicles — otherwise known as feeders — are established for each group of investors investors put capital into their respective feeder funds which ultimately invest assets into the master fund which is responsible for making all portfolio investments and conducting trading activity management and performance fees are paid at the feeder fund level breaking down masterfeeder fund the masterfeeder fund structure begins with the investor who feeds capital into the feeder fund the feeder fund in turn invests in the master fund similar to the purchase of any other security the feeder fund containing all the limited partnershipshareholder capital purchases shares of the master fund much like it would buy shares of any company’s stock the primary difference of course is that a feeder fund by buying into the master fund receives all of the master fund’s income attributes including interest gains tax adjustments and dividendsthe use of the masterfeeder fund structure allows assets managers to benefit from a large capital pool while also being able to fashion investment funds that cater to niche marketsstructurethe average masterfeeder structure involves one master fund with one onshore feeder and one offshore feeder feeder funds investing in the same master fund have the option of choice and variation meaning that they may differ in investor type fee structures investment minimums net asset values and various other operational attributes this means that feeder funds do not have to adhere to a specific master fund but can function legally as independent entities with that ability to invest in numerous different master fundsfor example if feeder fund as  contribution and feeder fund bs  contribution provided the total investments to a master fund then fund a would receive one third of the master fund profits while fund b would receive two thirdsadvantages and disadvantages of the masterfeeder fund structureone major advantage of the masterfeeder fund structure is the consolidation of various portfolios into one consolidation allows for reductions of operation and trading costs a larger portfolio has the benefit of economies of scale and thus because of its size the portfolio has better options when it comes to service and more favorable terms offered by prime brokers and other institutionsthe primary drawback to the masterfeeder fund structure is that funds held offshore are typically subjected to a withholding tax on us dividends another disadvantage is inherent to the structure as it pools together a combination of investors that often have a wide spectrum of characteristics as well as investment priorities often the battle to find a middle ground is uphill if not entirely impossible as investments and strategies that are suitable to one specific type of investor will be unsuited if not oppositional to the requirements of a different type of investor
