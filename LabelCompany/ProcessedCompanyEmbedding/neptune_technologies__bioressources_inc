about neptune technologies nept travis brown eventdriven research analyst longterm horizon valuediy stock investorsummaryalso known as neptune technologies  bioressources inc neptunes ceo comes from an interesting backgroundceo jim hamilton sees an end in sight for disputes with enzymotec ltdregardless of the outcome for acastis capre neptune is focused on their prevailing growth in omega nutritional productsneptune has completed successful acquisitions and is prepared for more seeking alpha contributor travis brown spoke with neptune wellness solutionsneptune technologies  bioressources inc nasdaq nept ceo jim hamilton in a telephone interview the following contains a summary of the interview sound bites via soundcloud and an update to the august  buyside review of the company an interview can aid fundamental analysis ceo jim hamilton took lead of the company in  and has since steered them towards acquisitions and increased the variety of omega products their growth chart is compelling and takes on a good turnaround story the company recently received a m royalty agreement after completing settlements with a top competitor mr hamiltons background includes positions at dsm nutritional products and the council for responsible nutrition this interview comes weeks after a successful interview of veru healthcarethe female health company nasdaqfhco ceo dr mitchell s steiner to read and listen to that interview click on veru healthcare the name is neptune the business is wellness solutions the name of the company has gone through transformations the former name was neptune technologies  bioressources inc and remains on the sec registration they have since changed their name and branding to neptune wellness solutions or even neptune for short neptune is primarily a businesstobusiness bb of omega nutraceuticals it once focused on a patented krill oil but has since broadened via acquisitions to include many omega products their ip portfolio is vast and includes more than  worldwide patents they own approximately  of acasti pharma inc nasdaqacst a pharmaceutical subsidiary with primary product capre headed towards phase iii testing interview with jim hamilton ceo of neptune travis brown can you share more of your background with dsm nutritional products do you have any experience with patent disputes or something of similar comparison jim hamilton ceo dsm nutritional products is the largest nutritional ingredients company in the world its a division of dsm a broader based company from engineering plastics to pharmaceuticals nutritional products is the major part of dsm overall i think its over  global dsm sales  employees and billions of dollars in sales and in virtually every country of the world very successful and wonderful company ive been involved in the nutritional products industry from the consumer side of things to the food side to the agrinutrition business to dietary supplements all of which are super businesses and growing in a dramatic way globally with dsm ive been involved with innovation to new compounds to acquisitions to new product launches i cant recall having big patent disputes when with dsm im sure there were some it was never a big part of our agenda we were more interested in novel new ingredients growing total markets acquiring complementary products and businesses we worked on a number of acquisitions when i was at dsm a couple of them were in the omega space martek and ocean nutrition being two examples there was a reason why we were investing in those businesses we believe fundamentally in the science of omega the omega space i like my experience in those transactions is that the money has got to be right the situation and synergies have to be right but also the psychology has to be right people want to put their business in the hands of someone that they have confidence in travis tell us more about your past experience with the council for responsible nutrition crn and how do they interrelate with neptune these years jim there are a number of trade associations engaged in the space clearly in my view they are the leading trade association and if you look at the membership roster you quickly come to that conclusion theres nobody in the world in my view that compares to the breadth and extent of the work that they do ive been on the board a number of years i was chairman for a number of years their job in essence is to represent the industry in a cohesive way largely to government regulators mostly in the united states but their work goes far beyond that it goes to the science it goes to communications it goes to media relations etc from my personal side it has been very rewarding just in terms of the people you get to work with and collaborate with when youre working shoulder to shoulder with a business partner on common interests outside of your commercial relationship its a powerful thing it helps enable very strong business connections over the longterm one example of what crn has been doing is with the ftc helping fund an office that basically enables the ftc to do a better job at policing the industry travis perhaps one of the elephants in the room enzymotec ltd nasdaqenzy it appears that they are one of the last to pay settlements and royalties in accordance to how courts have ruled the recent developments with aker biomarine making things right with neptune is there any hope for something similar with enzymotec travis regarding acasti and their capre i thought i saw a  announcement that acasti was now looking at an abbreviated b pathway for capre theyve been at this since  isnt it a bit late sunk costs in two phase i and two phase ii studies and what does this mean end of transcript potential catalysts the overall bullish theme for neptune is how well they have increased the diversity of the omega nutritional business they are more than insulated from the regulatory ups and downs for acastis capre i like to sell lots of stuff into lots of markets and i dont like being a single product company  ceo jim hamilton a less talked about product is nka which is new under mr hamiltons leadership nka is a protein from a krill byproduct it was costing the company to dispose of it an example of its use is in aquaculture feeds eg salmon these proteins from krill excite the fish mr hamilton further states animal feed is a great industry not much marketing required if you have a good product people buy it all day long when considering catalysts the revenue growth should be one its at a pace and depth that could finally awaken larger investors and the market in general when you look at this business in the last two years weve more than doubled almost tripled the sales weve made a tone of progress  ceo jim hamilton the potential catalysts include the recovery of royalties from ezymotec  possible partnership the organic growth of maximil nka and other omega products now that competitor aker biomarine is under a binding agreement a new ma per jim hamiltons statements on last earnings call neptunes valuation neptunes revenue growth for the trailing twelve months ttm has shown an increase of  and a large improvement on eps mainly due to a settlement payout the chart below is taken from neptunes q report  the annual pe ttmis now established with positive earnings
