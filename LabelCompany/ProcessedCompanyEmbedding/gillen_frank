russell stover came to lincoln the building which is being developed into the candy factory a  million retail commercial and restaurant complex was built around  countless candy lovers munched on the lincoln bar mr bigfellow the peanut shortcake and other candy bars made by the gillen company those are the bars mrs gillen’s son don remembers best because he says those were the ones he liked best “i was a great candy hound as all kids are” says gillen who is publisher of the york newstimes the gillen company also made boxed chocolates bulk hard candies and bulked dipped chocolates one of the company’s trademark’s mrs gillen remembers was the “gillen candy kid” a celluloid boy placed on the boxes of chocolates “there was the lincoln bar a peanut bar a marshmallow bar and oh there was a malted milk bar that really went over” mrs gillen recalls her fatherinlaw the late frank e gillen and william bonay pronounced bonnie began making candy in lincoln under the name gillen  boney in  after boney died in the world war i flu epidemic the name was changed to gillen’s candies mrs gillen’s husband the late frank r gillen served as vicepresident and his father president of the company “father gillen only finished the third grade but he was the perfect businessman no one got anything by him”  mrs gillen says mrs gillen began working in the factory when she was  for  a week “you had to work there a year before you got a raise” she continued working there until she was  and married “i married the president’s son i didn’t fool around” she said her eyes twinkling her first job she said was boxing cracker jack later she operated the machine that dipped chocolate “we bought all our chocolate from hershey’s we knew them and to this day the minute i open a box of candy i can tell if it’s good chocolate” she says in the years she worked at the factory “i handled an awful lot of candy” she recalled “it was quite a place” but the candy business wasn’t so sweet after world war ii started during the war it cost  cents to put the proper number of peanuts in a candy bar that sold for five cents mrs gillen says “the war put us out of business we couldn’t make any money” sugar chocolate and nuts—three items essential to candymaking—were in short supply in wartime mrs gillen explained “gillen was not a nationwide distributor so it was difficult for the company to establish quotas to get those items” in contrast the stover company was a national distributor and could get quotas on those items but did not have enough facilities to use all of their quotas as a result the gillen company closed in  and the russell stover company began leasing the building from frank r gillen and his two brothers mrs gillen’s husband became a partner in the stover company and worked for stover’s until his retirement in  he died in  and the gillen family sold the building to attorney richard richetts in  stover’s continued to lease the building until 0 when it closed its lincoln factory with that historical perspective it is not surprising that mrs gillen has her own opinions about the building “people always say the stover’s building it is not the stover’s building stover’s never owned the factory they simply leased the building”she says firmly similarly the house on rd and a streets is sometimes mistakenly referred to as “the stover house” she says it was  mrs gillen says with equal firmness the gillen house the home of her husband’s parents the th child in her family mrs gillen says she was “a very fortunate child” her mother died when she was 0 and mrs gillen quit school when she was  to work at the candy firm despite “a terrible childhood” she says “i think i’m better off now” and she says “nobody could have had a more wonderful life than i we were married  years and nobody had a nicer married life than me i loved to take care of my house and i loved to cook and take care of my children” mrs gillen has another son dick gillen of lubbock texas a daughter dorothy wright of lincoln six grandchildren and seven greatgrandchildren frank e gillen was born in  at south bend ind in  he apprenticed to a local candy maker then moved to omaha in  to work voegel  dinng candy co and his son frank b gillen was born in  brothers te and a a lasch moved to lincoln first working in wholesale groceries then organizing lasch brothers  co confectioners

bungalow candies which were sold from the stover’s home at 0 detroit st in denver in  a stick was added to make it easier to “handle” world war ii brought sugar rationing anew as well as distribution and marketing problems to all the nation’s candy makers one insider said that with all candy’s ingredients in short supply it literally cost more to produce some products than their retail price before the war in order to obtain allocations and spread distribution nationally russell stover purchased gillen  boney as well as several other smaller confectioners in  the eighth street building
