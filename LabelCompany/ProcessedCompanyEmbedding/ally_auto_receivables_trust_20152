stable  class a assetbacked notes aaasf outlook stable key rating drivers stable collateral quality the pool consists of strong quality leases with a weighted average wa fico score of  seasoning of  months and a reasonably diversified residual value rv maturity schedule sufficient credit enhancement structure initial credit enhancement ce to the class a notes is  building to  until the class a notes are repaid at which point it reduces to  available ce is sufficient to support fitchs aaasf stressed credit and residual loss assumptions of  and  respectively improved loss performance credit and residual losses on allys portfolio have exhibited stable performance in recent years while some normalization has occurred in  overall performance remains well below elevated levels observed in  and  stable corporate health fitch rates ally financial the parent of ally the originator and servicer bb with a stable outlook fitch believes ally financial to be a capable originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical performance of its managed portfolio and prior securitizations evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market has been normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects that increasing offlease vehicle supply and pressure from increased production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during the life of the transaction legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of ally would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to ally auto receivables trust sn to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays relatively little sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses showing downgrades of only one rating category even under fitchs severe  times base case loss scenario the transaction shows significantly more sensitivity to residual loss volatility though even under fitchs severe scenario the class a notes could be downgraded by four categories key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the presale report dated feb   fitchs analysis of the representations and warranties rw of this transaction can be found in ally auto receivables trust sn  appendix this rw is compared to those of typical rw for the asset class as detailed in the special report representations warranties and
