of california at berkeley school of lawstephen f ross pennsylvania state university penn state law date written april   abstract in its landmark decision in carolene products the supreme court crafted a uniquely american solution to the countermajoritarian dilemma present in any constitutional democracy when unelected judges should substantively review policy choices made by elected legislators and executives the political process theory underlying that decision is that a court with a history of decisions based on judicial ideology should limit close review of government actions to three situations  when the action contravenes a specific provision of the bill of rights  when the action threatens to improperly limit the political process or  with regard to the broadly worded due process and equal protection clauses when courts determine that the political process does not work normally the court has not faithfully implemented this approach over the years however neither justices nor commentators have developed a superior alternative approach we believe that most americans ought to prefer a return to carolene products as superior either philosophically or because of risk aversion to leaving important constitutional precedents subject to the vagaries of highly partisan politics our approach builds upon insights of justices harlan fiske stone robert jackson and thurgood marshall first courts should consider challenges initially under the equal protection clause second the category of cases warranting heightened judicial scrutiny should be expanded to include claimants who can prove that they are excluded from madisonian factional “wheeling and dealing” that characterizes ordinary politics third substantive due process claims should remain available but only where claimants can demonstrate that animus or prejudice precludes their ability to use the political process to redress their grievances suggested citation suggested citation choper jesse h and
