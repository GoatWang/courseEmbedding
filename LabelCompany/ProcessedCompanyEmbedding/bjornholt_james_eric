recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to microchips president and chief financial officer mr eric bjornholt james eric bjornholt good afternoon everyone during the course of this conference call we will be making projections and other forwardlooking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company we wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially we refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the sec that identify important risk factors that may impact microchips business and results of operations in attendance with me today are steve sanghi microchips president and ceo ganesh moorthy microchips coo i will comment on our third quarter fiscal year  financial performance and steve and ganesh will then give their comments on the results discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance we will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions i want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various gaap and nongaap measures we have posted a full gaap to nongaap reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at wwwmicrochipcom which we believe you will find useful when comparing gaap and nongaap results i will now go through some of the operating results including net sales gross margin and operating expenses i will be referring to these results on a nongaap basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and sharebased compensation net sales in the december quarter were  million and were down  sequentially from net sales of  million in the immediately preceding quarter revenue by product line was  million for microcontrollers  million for analog  million for memory  million for licensing and  million of other revenue by geography was  million in the americas  million in europe and  million in asia i remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to which tends to skew some of the revenue towards asia where a lot of the contract manufacturing takes place on a nongaap basis gross margins were  in the december quarter nongaap operating expenses were  of sales nongaap operating income was  of sales and net income was  million this resulted in earnings of  per diluted share which was  above the midpoint of our guidance on a gaap basis gross margins including sharebased compensation and acquisitionrelated expenses were  in the december quarter gaap gross margins include the impact of  million of sharebased compensation total operating expenses were  million or  of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of  million sharebased compensation of  million and special charges of  million the gaap net income was  million or  per diluted share gaap net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of  million and a onetime gain of  million on our acquisition of eqcologic for which gaap accounting required us to write up our previous ownership of  to its fair value ganesh will discuss the eqcologic acquisition later on this call in the december quarter the nongaap tax rate was  and the gaap tax rate was  the gaap tax rate was favorably impacted by the  million of nonrecurring favorable tax events i mentioned before our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect to various nonrecurring items excluding any nonrecurring events we expect our longerterm forwardlooking nongaap effective tax rate to be about  to  to summarize the aftertax impact the nongaap adjustments had on microchips earnings per share in the december quarter acquisitionrelated items were about  sharebased compensation was about  nonrecurring favorable tax events were about  the onetime gain on the eqcologic acquisition was about  and noncash interest expense was about  the dividend declared today of  per share will be paid on march   to shareholders of record on february   excuse me february   the cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately  million this quarters dividend will be our th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment we have never made reductions in our dividend and in fact this quarters increase marks the th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividend paid is approaching  billion this program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders moving on to the balance sheet consolidated inventory at december   was  million or  days we expect days of inventory at the end of march to be down between  and  days based on our revenue guidance range inventory at our distributors stayed flat in the december quarter at  days and remain at low levels compared to where they have been historically i want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sellthrough basis at december  the accounts receivable balance was  million and decreased by  million on a sequential basis receivable balances remain in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers free cash flow generation in the december quarter was  million prior to our dividend payment as of december  the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately  billion and we had  million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit excluding dividend payments we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately  million to  million in the march quarter capital spending was approximately  million for the december quarter we expect about  million in capital spending in the march quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year  to be about  million as we are adding capital to support the growth of the business and to bring inhouse more of the assembly and test operations that were outsourced by smsc depreciation expense in the december quarter was  million i will now ask ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the december quarter ganesh ganesh moorthy thank you eric and good afternoon everyone lets take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers our overall microcontroller revenue declined  sequentially in the december quarter however microcontroller revenue was up  versus the yearago quarter reflecting a year of excellent market share gain in calendar  microcontrollers represented  of microchips overall revenue in the december quarter as we projected during our last quarters conference call we shipped a  billionth cumulative microcontroller in november just  months after we shipped our  billionth microcontroller back in april our bit microcontroller business was down  sequentially in the december quarter however bit microcontroller revenue was up  over the yearago quarter as we gained significant market share in calendar  this business continues to be an important engine of ongoing growth for us and we continue to find and serve new customers and new applications with our expanding portfolio our bit microcontroller business was down  sequentially in the december quarter however bit microcontroller revenue was up  over the yearago quarter as once again we gain substantial market share in this segment during the december quarter we had  blockbuster announcements first the featurerich picmz family of products which have the highest computational performance of any microcontroller in the category as well as the best software efficiency and second the mplab harmony integrated software platform the industrys first software framework to integrate both internal and thirdparty middleware drivers peripheral libraries and realtime operating systems thats simplifying and accelerating the bit software development process which is one of the larger challenges customers face both these solutions have received broad industry accolades and customer acceptance we are continuing to rapidly expand our new product portfolio win new designs and expand into new fields of play like the internet of things to enable further growth in revenue and market share our overall microcontroller results as well as each of our bit bit and bit results are clearly outperforming the market with yearoveryear growth rates well above the market and what weve seen reported by our competitors in their results were gaining significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the bestperforming microcontroller franchise in the industry now moving to our analog business our analog business bucked the trend and grew  sequentially in the december quarter the ninth consecutive quarter of sequential growth to achieve a new record and continues to perform exceptionally well analog revenue was also up  from the yearago quarter reflecting significant market share gains analog revenue represented  of microchips overall revenue in the december quarter and we continue to have one of the bestperforming analog franchises in the industry in november we announced the acquisition of eqcologic a brusselsbased early stage company who has innovative equalizer and coax transceiver products and technologies which are important to our automotive and other embedded networking initiatives eqcologics leadership equalizer technology enables the effective recovery of highspeed signals that may degrade as they transmit over longer distances in an automotive infotainment network for example this technology enables substantial systemlevel cost reduction as oems can switch from expensive optical fiber networks to much more costeffective coaxial cable networks even though the signals degrade more in a coax cable network as compared to an optical fiber network last but not least in our core analog business we are continuing to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business now moving to our memory business our memory business which is comprised of our serial esquared memory products as well as our superflash memory products was sequentially down  we continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions our memory business represented  of microchips overall revenue in the december quarter now let me pass it to steve for some general comments as well as our guidance going forward steve steve sanghi thank you ganesh and good afternoon everyone today i will first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of  then i will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of  we are very pleased with our execution in the december quarter all of the nongaap financial metrics like net sales gross margin percentage operating expense percentage operating profit percentage and earnings per share were ator better than the midpoint of our guidance our operating profit percentage is approaching  and we are making excellent progress towards our longterm goal of  operating profit nongaap earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of the guidance by  per share our overall net sales in december quarter were up  versus the yearago quarter marking an excellent year of market share growth compared to a low singledigit growth for the industry our analog business made a new alltime record in december quarter with sales up  sequentially and up  over the yearago quarter all other major segments of the business was sequentially down a bit based on the seasonally weakest quarter of the year the end of december quarter also marks the completion of the  calendar year which was an excellent year for microchip in every respect last but not the least the december quarter was our rd consecutive profitable quarter i want to thank all the employees of microchip for their contribution in making this an outstanding year for microchip now i will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of  the march quarter is seasonally a middleoftheroad quarter for microchip not as strong as june and september but not sequentially down as december it does not feel any different this year and we expect this to be a seasonally normal quarter europe is normally very strong in this quarter america is in the middle and asia is down due to lunar new year holidays taking all of this into account we expect the march quarter net sales to be flat to up  sequentially on a nongaap basis we expect our gross margin to be between  and  of sales which is a slight improvement from december quarter we expect operating expenses to be between  and  of sales we expect operating profit to be between  and  of sales and we expect nongaap eps to be between  and  per share our eps is getting a slight negative impact by the addition of about  million shares through the share count this is because of significantly higher average stock price in the current quarter versus the last quarter the rising stock price mix of our  billion convertible transaction more in the money and results into a higher effective share count given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles restructuring charges and inventory writeup on acquisitions microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a nongaap basis we believe that nongaap results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their nongaap estimates to press corp with this operator will you please pull for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well hear first from kevin cassidy with stifel kevin e cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc research division i was just wondering in the automotive market theres been talk of ethernet coming into the automobile are you seeing that trend and are you preparing for that ganesh moorthy so there are many standards that come into the automotive marketplace in automotive networking for infotainment the most network is the dominant standard today there are obviously alternates in any given market ethernet is one of them that is in consideration but we believe we have a strong position in the marketplace and a position that customers have validated with their choice of our network kevin e cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc research division okay and maybe just talk a little bit more about automotive are there many opportunities for bit microcontrollers and whats your traction there ganesh moorthy so the answer is yes there are many bit applications in automotive as you know we have been on the journey for bit for not as many years as some of the incumbents who play in that space but we are starting to make inroads in bit applications in carmakers just as we have previously with our bit as well as our bit along the way so we fully expect as time goes on youll see that our microcontrollers across the spectrum of s s and s will play in many automotive applications steve sanghi id like to add to that when you come up with a brand new product line whether its   and  if the first  products you make are for the automotive market which means they have all the can bus the lin bus and all the protocols and everything that the automotive needs then your first revenue is  or  years away and thats not the best way to launch a brand new product line so just like we did that with  or  we originally come up with a product line that will be quicker timetomarket in other applications industrial consumer and all the others and then as the product line gains momentum and the architecture is accepted we have round out all  any other issues any of the others then you add the automotive features and start to work with automotive so that began  years ago or so and now we have designs in automotive and were moving but the large portion of the revenue is not automotive yet operator well move next to gil alexandre with darphil associates gilbert alexandre could you remind me of what are your growth margin goals longterm model steve sanghi so our longterm model for those margin is  plusminus  and we are certainly making progress the middle point of the guidance for us in the current quarter is  so were reaching towards it and continue to make fairly good progress operator moving on to craig hettenbach with morgan stanley craig hettenbach  morgan stanley research division you noted the strong growth in  and bit yearoveryear can you provide any color or context from new product introductions what youre doing on those product lines and anything from a design win perspective james eric bjornholt so in any given year we have anywhere from  to  brandnew products that we bring to market a substantial portion of that continues to be bit and bit because our portfolio there was not as rich as we did on the bit i dont have the exact numbers but were well over  products at this point on our bit and were well above  products in our bit portfolio craig hettenbach  morgan stanley research division got it and as a followup on the smsc transaction you guys saw a very strong margin expansion early on can you talk about just the revenue synergies and opportunities that you see over the next  to  months on that side ganesh moorthy the revenue synergies are building over the last year we have spent time in looking at how our customers application boards where microchip prior to smsc did not play but smsc customers could use our products and how that could be brought to bear on new designs and likewise where smsc products could be brought into the microchip customer base so it is a  these are longdesign cycles they take   months to get to the point where they get to revenue there are many the pipeline some of the early ones have gone to production but were very optimistic in terms of how the  product lines combined play a stronger role at many end customers than what each of us individually could have played steve sanghi i mentioned this in the last conference call in november i believe that i spent a week with all of our asian distributors collected them all in  geography and nearly  or  of them and reviewed the last calendar year and had them  put some plans together for the current calendar year and it was quite surprising to see that microchips distribution which was not smsc distribution before how much crossselling opportunity they had identified on smsc products into the microchip customer base there was in fact the highlight of the conference that just very very significant opportunity they have identified in all of our consumer industrial accounts with usb and ethernet and all of the other smsc products so they will take some time to go to production but the opportunity is significant operator operator instructions well move back to jim schneider with goldman sachs james schneider  goldman sachs group inc research division sorry about the difficulty before steve i was just wondering if you could address again your new longer  new higher longerterm margin model it seems like the biggest place where you have to improve to get there is in the gross margin line can you talk about some of the utilization or cost structure measures in the cost of goods sold or mix and what the timeframe would be to kind of hope you to get to  up to that  model steve sanghi well i can lead you there qualitatively but not really quantitatively breaking down the impact of each of the other things so some of the qualitative factors are obviously fab utilization our internal fabs are not at the capacity they were yet at the peak for a number of reasons as the couple of years go by some of the technology migration happens and were producing parts at a better nodes so therefore it just produces a large number of die in a wafer and therefore cutting the number of wafers some of the products are made in outside foundries where it was more either costeffective or more feasible or we didnt have the technology inside so for a number of reasons were not at that full capacity so theres a significant accretion still coming as that goes towards a peak production the acquisitions are not  integrated we are far into it but if you look at both from an assembly and test perspective and the wafer pro perspective were still moving a lot of the smsc products into microchip and if were to guess what portion of the test is converted ganesh moorthy probably about   steve sanghi  of the test is converted so it takes a while to get the momentum but now we have the testers and load boards and programs and it will rise very rapidly but the first thing takes longer so theres a lot of accretion coming from that also and then there is a continuous margin improvement on our smaller product lines which are newer in nature where it takes a while for the products to ring out and build the nextgeneration products which are more cost effective and higheryielding in our new technologies so there are a number of things playing role in it and combination of all that gets there i mean we could get there on paper with a margin to give james schneider  goldman sachs group inc research division okay thats helpful and then as a followup in terms of the environment in asia you talked about that being a little bit weaker in the quarter maybe thats just a seasonal thing but clearly theres been a lot of concern whether thats real or not real about china in the emerging markets china pmi was down a little bit can you talk about just the overall order environment and what your customers are telling you out of asia and what youre seeing from asian distributors in particular steve sanghi well asia goes through about  days of holidays and driven by that in the current quarter forecast so asia is down just about as much as it historically is just by the number of days theyre off so thats why we called the quarter pretty seasonally normal booking patterns are normal theres really nothing abnormal to call theres not any kind of crisis or disaster in the works our products are also very ubiquitous though they go into areas where as chinese are building more and more consumerism a lot of them they acquire these products where our products are in were in the things and people buy a things operator well now hear from susquehanna financial groups chris caso christopher caso  susquehanna financial group lllp research division just a question about production levels and i think last quarter you suggested the plan was to keep production fairly constant as you went through this quarter and your comments suggested that the inventory levels internally come down as a result of that if you hit those inventory targets by the end of this quarter should we expect the production levels to start increasing as we go into the june quarter and if you could give some sense of the effect of that on gross margins steve sanghi well i think it depends on where we are within the guidance which is really narrow flat to up  we have not put together a plan and were in the middle of our annual operating planning process our fiscal year ends at the end of the current quarter so we dont really have an official fiscal  plan yet to really see what production well be running but if we grow production that will improve gross margin the inventory is not exactly where i want it to be i think it needs more improvement well get some this quarter whether we need some more next quarter or we could completely improve production we dont know yet it depends on where it will land do you have something to add james eric bjornholt no i was going to say theres ongoing gross margin improvement from the back end from assembly and test as we bring more of that inhouse as well christopher caso  susquehanna financial group lllp research division so you may get some gross margin improvement from the back end but the front end is obviously dependent on the revenue levels and where the inventory goes james eric bjornholt thats right steve sanghi we expect improvement in june quarter in gross margin right no question about it well june quarter is generally a strong quarter for us and therell be higher absorption and there should be a gross margin improvement in june quarter no question christopher caso  susquehanna financial group lllp research division okay and just looking out as you say youre in the planning process for fiscal  what do you expect your strategic priorities to be as you look into fiscal  and assuming the demand environment kind of stays stable as it is now smsc the integration seems to be i would guess id characterize late innings now not sure how you would characterize it but where does the management focus turn to as you go into fiscal  steve sanghi well were not a onetrick pony i mean at the current quarter guidance were almost a  billion company just slightly shy of that around   divisions inside the company so continue to building out bit and bit and analog and theres still a lot of new products in bit well continue to gain a lot of share in bit as other people either cant compete or dont want it or whatever so all the strategic product lines have a very strong roadmap and theyre all showing significant growth in the initial analysis then if you look at from an end market or application perspective were getting a very significant acceptance in growth in the internet of things motor control digital power lighting medical touch automotive so there are just way too many i mean were really  we show a chart in the presentations there are about  different segments that we have significant focus in now the other thing that weve been telling you for years microchip has one company recognize this before many of the others in the industry that semiconductor industries has matured and saturating and if you look at the overall semiconductor growth they are in low singledigits year after year we have done well our december quarter was up  yearoveryear  but we also understand that there is a significant industry growth headwind that every company faces and therefore we also are trying to supplement microchips growth by a constant stream of small and some large acquisitions to bring in overall growth to a reasonable number where it will be acceptable to microchip management and its board so its a combination of internal and external growth its not only one or the other and were not doing acquisitions to mask any risk of our internal growth were doing it to enhance on the top of the internal growth that youve seen us now for several years operator well now go to joanne feeney with abr investment strategy joanne feeney i have a followup question on the issue of the guidance for the current quarter im wondering this is the first round of a march guidance weve seen since the acquisition was fully integrated and im wondering if what were picking up here is perhaps that little bit of a shift in your seasonal pattern given the different end markets that are now weighing in and as you said china youre seeing probably some of your stuff go into more consumeroriented products so some of the last  years the data and throughout the  that were real outliers you typically saw around  to  growth in the march quarter so can you  do you have a sense of this whether youre seeing basically a little bit of a shift in your seasonal pattern because of the different end market mix than before the acquisition steve sanghi well joanne you are always very astute and smart in your analysis and i think you have answered your question there are  shifts in that seasonality minor ones but theyre definitely worth noting one is that with the acquisitions and all that we have little more of our business now in the computing segment which kind of sees a significant decline in the calendar first quarter than we had in the microchips core business so theres a little impact of that the second impact is asia is becoming a larger and larger portion of our business i mean china is a huge portion of our business now we break those out in the qs you can read them so as that becomes larger and larger portion of the business then you have a larger portion of overall microchip that takes a drop in the calendar first quarter because of the chinese new year and if theres enough shift in the business in asia and that starts to be material so i think those combined two things together this is probably the new normal but it probably also mean that youll pick up that gap on other quarters which are either stronger quarters for asia or theyre stronger quarters for smsc business so overall it hasnt shifted but theres a slight impact in the calendar first quarter because of those  reasons joanne feeney all right okay perfect and then as a follow up just looking longer term at your opportunities for continued share gain its been quite impressive in bit and bit but one might expect that that would naturally slow down as you kind of tick off the lowhanging fruit so i guess could you give us some sense of what you expect over the next year or so and how you expect if you do to continue to gain share and what you think the pace of that will be that is the growth of those  segments relative to the industry steve sanghi well the current estimates arent saying that it kind of slows down if it does thats really minor in nature but then you pick up the difference by newer applications where we can now do a very good job where maybe historically we could not with the highperformance  and bit product lines like digital power like the lighting like the internet of things wifi connectivity and all that kind of stuff so we are opening additional large amount of served available market i mean if you look at the internet of things our revenue in internet of things is hundreds of millions of dollars if you look at the overall definition of what some of the others are calling as overall internet connectivity or machinetomachine connectivity and its the fastestgrowing segment of the business so there are always pluses and minuses and something saturates but then the new opportunities emerge and how well positioned you are you want to talk about iot a little bit ganesh moorthy yes i think as steve mentioned this is one of the exciting areas of opportunity presented to us and the broad adoption of tablets and smartphones are one of the catalysts that are accelerating the demand for more things to be connected and accessible by these mobile devices and weve historically had a very strong presence in a broad range of things that are in our home and in some of our other areas where we interact and we think we have a pole position on  as these things get connected our solutions being in the center of how they are connected therefore things that we know  areas that we have to bring to bear to win in the internet of things market one is a strong portfolio of microcontrollers and analog which we have and were continuing to strengthen two is a strong portfolio of wireless and wired connectivity three is a suite of the software and firmware requirement for the different protocol and security that is going to be required any time you have connectivity and finally the fourth is a set of partners who can provide both costeffective and scalable cloud infrastructure because most of them are really not it experts nor have any it infrastructure and when you put it all together its epicenter of where we have played we have customers that we know very well and we have technologies to enable them and we are seeing many many of them taking advantage of that capability joanne feeney so it sounds like youre looking at some adjacent sockets in products where youre already appearing in dishwashers and other white goods for example steve sanghi yes so we are in things and now we are helping customers connect those things so selling additional content whether its a wireless module or an rf module are really getting them helping them do more things and then continuing with the answer to your question we talked about all the crossselling opportunities with smsc products into our socket so think about how many cars today have a usb charger socket in the car every time i do an analysis if there are  people im talking to and i ask a question the number comes out to be about  and  in   of the cars people have a usb charger you can always charge for the cigarette lighter but im talking about the actual usb charger and now fast forward  or  years dont you think all   of the cars will have a usb charger because thats whats becoming the life and who is getting in all these cars whose usb chargers are in most of the cars its yours truly so there are always areas which are growing significantly faster where theres a significant opportunity when you look at the usb  so we have proprietary technology where you plug in a smartphone into the usb charger of the car and a phone can become the host and whatever you have on the phone it will display that whether its navigation or whatever on the screen of the car which could be extremely beneficial everybody uses navigation on their phone as they travel or get rental cars everybody uses the phone i know how to use it in my phone i dont even know how to use it in my car next time im going to get one in the car because i have it in the phone and you plug it to the usb charger and it displays what youre running on your phone on your car so  and we were showing that at the ces show in las vegas an actual demo of that working so there are tremendous opportunities coming up with this connectivity and were right in the thicket of it and there are lots of design wins there are lots of opportunities so those things will grow faster and some of the mature businesses could slow down a little bit but the overall opportunity has not decreased operator well go now to harsh kumar with stephens harsh n kumar  stephens inc research division a question for ganesh ganesh congratulations steve and ganesh congratulations on pretty impressive microcontroller growth as a category i was wondering if you could provide some color on maybe between   and  which one you think you took the most share in if you want to rank order them or just talk qualitatively i would appreciate the color steve sanghi i think if you want to look at the dollars we took the most share in bit didnt we ganesh moorthy yes in overall dollars because thats the rank order of the revenue is bit the largest business followed by  followed by  but if you look at the growth rates youre going to find that compared to where the baseline grew  and bit is where we grew outgrew and bit will have outgrown but by not quite the same magnitude so its hard  well know in  or  months when all the official numbers will be put together but im expecting well see large gains across   and  harsh n kumar  stephens inc research division okay fair enough guys thats helpful and i wanted to ask you in your press release steve you talked about the mplab harmony integrated software platform i was struggling to understand how that will work in terms of you being able to sell chips maybe you could take up a couple of minutes to explain how that flows through in your pl steve sanghi well so the most difficult thing for the customer in a bit is development of the software and the firmware and if you have a piecemeal solution where the chip comes from one party the stack comes from another party the library comes from another party the development will come from somebody else and then you have to put all those things together then you dont have a very good experience because when something isnt working you dont know whether its architecture or the chip or the software or the development tool or whatever so what microchip has done is the entire pic solution comes from microchip but its much more like an apple kind of experience where the product the architecture the software the development tool the libraries the stacks everything is coming from microchip and already crosschecked and functional so what we have done on the top of that now with the harmony software is really integrated the entire ecosystem we also integrated the thirdparty software the middleware the stacks and everything all prechecked out and customers are telling us its up to   productivity and this development of the software is about  of the total cost in adopting a bit microcontroller into an end application and on that  of the cost if you can provide that much productivity on an industry accolades are coming like crazy so how we essentially monetize this winning more designs accelerating timetomarket selling more bit chips and then in all the software and all that you always have a version of it which is free essentially anybody can use it so theres a wide acceptance of it but then you have premium versions and you have software support and upgrades and all that for which you charge it becomes a product but thats not where the big money is big money is really still selling that chip operator and next from crédit suisse well hear from john pitzer john w pitzer  crédit suisse ag research division i apologize ive been jumping back and forth across a couple of calls steve so if you addressed this i do apologize but its been my perception that the environment over the last couple of quarters has sort of given you guys perhaps a little bit more visibility than sort of normal and im kind of curious notwithstanding kind of the seasonal issues in the march quarter as you think about lead times and just the rate at which customers are placing orders how would you kind of characterize visibility today and i guess as you answer the question steve youve always had a better view than most on the economy and the macro and im kind of curious as you think about  is the macro a tailwind a headwind or a neutral factor as we think about your growth steve sanghi the best guess would be neutral john w pitzer  crédit suisse ag research division and then just relative to visibility today versus lets say  days ago how are you guys seeing kind of customer activity in order is it just tracking around normal seasonality and so we really have to wait until after chinese new year to have a better assessment steve sanghi yes it hasnt changed basically theres a lot of positioning and jockeying for position for the chinese new year and even for december some people have yearend in december theyre trying to lower the inventories some distributors have a fiscal year ending at some other times so they kind of adjust the inventory a different time some people want the product before the chinese new year so they can participate in the surge afterwards and some place the order but they want to take their delivery after so there are all these crosscurrents and its kind of  i think the good thing is chinese new year is early i mean its beginning now and  months of the quarter are left after that and usually every time that happens where the chinese new year is early usually has been a positive result john w pitzer  crédit suisse ag research division and steve as my followup at our conference in december you gave a pretty informative presentation about the positioning of bit and kind of what youre doing at the software level on the ecosystem and correct me if im wrong but the argument sort of was youre kind of hitting an inflection point or a critical mass point where  might actually start to show even more meaningful gains in the strong growth youre seeing is that how i should think about the  big growth prospects for  and i also noticed in the quarter you announced an armbased microcontroller should i just think about that as another arrow in your quiver or is there something more strategic behind that steve sanghi so several questions in there number one yes the point i made on bit is we went over  products last quarter and  products is kind of the magical critical mass if you have fewer products in a microcontroller then you have engagement issues with our customer where the customer engages he does all this work and says i like the architecture ill use your product but then they need more memory or the connectivity they need a lin bus they need a wifi they need an rf on the chip and you dont have that version of the product then their work is wasted and they have to go through the different architectures so customers often look for having a sufficient critical mass of products where theres a very high probability that the product they need is in the portfolio and at plus products that becomes really real so we really we hit that number so we think thats a reasonable inflection point and the second is the  main things that i talked about at your conference and ganesh talked about it today one is the announcement of the bit and  mz product line which is really industrys the highest performance microcontroller in its class and second is this harmony software development tool which is absolutely a productivity giver to the customers so we think all those things combined is really a gamechanger and were starting to see it in the feedback were getting operator well hear now from craig ellis with b riley craig a ellis  b riley caris research division i wanted to follow up on a different product segment the analog product group the business has performed very well in the last year and how should we think about the way youre looking at growing that business as we think about calendar  and beyond whether it be from a product group standpoint where do you feel like you can add products or whether it be just from taking that product to market whether it be channel management strategies what have you steve sanghi well so we have described over the years where we had a threepronged strategy in analog early on at the start of the century our analog strategy was largely attaching analog to our own microcontrollers for the first few years because we had no name recognition in analog we didnt know microchip makes analog so we had a great name recognition in microcontrollers so we will position and attach rpms and supervisors and power management and those kind of products together with our microcontroller sockets and at one point at the peak well over  of our analog business was attached to our microcontroller but that strategy was quite successful then we went into the phase  where we said well our analog products are so well designed and architected to work in a microcontrollerembedded control environment why would we limit ourself to only microchips microcontrollers back then we had   market share in microcontroller overall because we didnt even make  and  at that time bit why we would not position this to any microcontroller whether its freescale or nxp or atmel or st or anybody else we dont win the microcontroller but we still compete for the analog because our architecture is very well to work next to those designs so that was the phase  of that strategy and they were very successful a few years ago it accelerated our growth rate on analog and then in the last few years we said phase  why would we now limited only to the microcontroller sockets what about fpga what about dsp what about socs silicon on chip or really any kind of sockets and that put us in a direct competition with ti adi linear maxim some of the big companies and we have what over  products in analog now ganesh moorthy about  to  steve sanghi   analog products so broad portfolio and positioning it really headon with in any kind of sockets and it has worked very well and were growing we have the best performance of analog in the industry compared to  look at the yearoveryear growth rates compared to anybody ganesh moorthy and its not just the last year right if you go back and look at it its now been for several years weve seen that analog has performed exceptionally well and outgrown the analog industry and the semiconductor industry both steve sanghi and people have some sort of this mix that analog is black magic and all the analog engineers work for these other companies and you cant find them and thats just kind of not true we were able to attract them we had lots of analog engineers working in our microcontroller groups because  of the microcontroller revenue is with the large amount of analog on the same die and we were able to package some of that functionality standalone some of it together with the microcontroller but really we were able to amass a fair amount of these sources some through acquisitions some ourselves and then created one of the bestperforming analog franchises in the industry craig a ellis  b riley caris research division well i was going to summarize it by saying it seems like what youre saying is the recipe for growth is to continue to execute on the strategy that you have in place as i look back at some of your past comments i think it was  quarters ago maybe it was even  where you said based on the successful completion of the smsc deal you were ready to do another midsized deal subsequent to that there hasnt been such a deal is the issue that there arent good targets out there is the issue that there are good targets but that with the market going so much higher that the valuations arent where youd be comfortable where do you stand with respect to growing through acquisition at this point steve sanghi so like i said early on i dont know whether you were on the call yet or not but i mentioned in fiscal  and then going forward we continue to have a strategy of significant internal growth and then further beefed up by continuous small or occasionally large acquisition beyond that i couldnt really give you any signal for timing or what area or whatever but its like were active constantly operator and well take a followup from kevin cassidy with stifel kevin e cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc research division i just wanted to see if you could give a few comments around the licensing business do you have more contracts on the way and how does licensing play into the internet of things steve sanghi so the only way licensing plays in the internet of things is really enabling our superflash technology to build lowpower microcontrollers in the industry which will then go to the internet of things otherwise it doesnt really have a direct play what we have successfully done is really essentially licensed to every major foundry is licensed on a superflash technology the largest big foundries any other foundry you name the one in taiwan the one in china the ones in singapore the ones in malaysia the ones in europe they all have license of superflash technology and some are in production and some are proceeding towards the production where the licensing happened either last year or the year before and these are very complex technologies it takes a couple of years to go to production so theres a significant additional revenue growth ahead as these additional foundries go to production and the royalty income begin we have more than doubled the business since we bought sst when we bought it it was doing  million a year business were doing about  million now and theres further growth ahead as many more of these foundries go to production operator and gentlemen at this time well turn the conference back to you all for closing remarks steve sanghi well thanks for attending the conference our next conference we go to is james eric bjornholt were presenting at stifel conference on february  steve sanghi okay so well see some of you there otherwise well talk to you next quarter operator and that will conclude todays conference again we thank you all for joining us steve sanghi
