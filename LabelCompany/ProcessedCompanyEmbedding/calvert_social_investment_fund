proprietary strategy developed by us trust is based on a growing awareness that strong corporate financial performance and social responsibility are not mutually exclusive rather they are mutually beneficial qualities for investors si seeks to answer yes to an ageold question is it possible to do good and do well at the same time utilizing the principle of shared value the idea of investing according to personal values and beliefs is hardly new at least since the midth century when quakers banned followers from participating in the slave trade individuals and groups have periodically chosen to avoid investments that conflict with moral religious environmental or other values this approach to investing now often referred to as socially responsible investing or sri is viewed largely in terms of what it doesnt do investors choose what not to invest in — such as tobacco weapons manufacturers and alcohol and because sri entails limiting the universe of potentially profitable investments the implication is that though this might be a noble endeavor the investor is challenged by a restricted investment universe  during the s fortune magazine famously described sri as feel good investing and politically correct investing but as interest in sri has continued to grow a new more active and demanding approach to social investing has emerged based on the idea that social responsibility and corporate earnings should naturally go hand in hand dr michael porter of the institute for strategy and competitiveness at harvard business school summed up this new idea corporate social responsibility can be much more than a cost a constraint or a charitable deed — it can be a source of opportunity innovation and competitive advantage inspired by those words us trust has created socially innovative investing which takes traditional socially responsible investing a step further si incorporates an active proprietary method for reviewing us securities across a wide spectrum of criteria that weight both social responsibility and financial fundamentals to be considered for inclusion companies must be attractive fundamentally as well as fit global macro investment themes established by us trusts thought leadership team during the portfolio construction process sector weights adhere to us trusts recommendation the principle of shared value si stands on the idea that corporations and society dont indeed cant thrive as wholly separate unrelated entities corporations need vibrant communities in order to create demand for their products and to provide a supportive environment in which to operate society needs healthy competitive companies able to create jobs buy local goods from the community and pay taxes where these needs intersect in a zone of shared values is the sweet spot of si it is our conviction that companies that demonstrate and remain committed to policies and practices that enhance their own competitiveness while simultaneously advancing economic and social convictions in their communities not only meet the ethical criteria of socially minded investors but stand best poised to prosper in a pure business sense the framework our framework for assessing a companys commitment to social innovation rests on three pillars human capital engagement how does the company treat all of its stakeholders employees shareholders customers suppliers and the community considerations include such issues as the pay gap between management and employees employee ownership health and wellness diversity and product quality among others environmental stewardship what policies does the company employ for interacting with the environment considerations include greenhouse gas reduction renewable energy use emissions effluents and wastes recycling and others corporate philanthropy what are the standards and procedures regarding its role as a corporate citizen considerations include community engagement community investment corporate giving employee volunteerism and community impact policies measuring a companys actual commitment to these pillars involves a twopart review of stated policies and performance accountability policy review we review benchmark and score policies based on our analysis that good policies indicate good management and are indicators of longterm value creation performance accountability review because good intentions dont always result in positive results we assess companies by how effectively a corporation has implemented its policies and crucially we consider whether it has capitalized on external incentives for good corporate behavior and avoided costly fines and penalties however it is our belief that while quantifying intent and peertopeer benchmarking is important the direct tangible results of the policies must be measured in order to determine their absolute or relative success monitoring and maintaining the portfolio continual attention monitoring and adjustment are required to keep the si properly balanced to achieve its goals we review changes in us trusts recommended sector allocations and periodically rebalance the portfolio we monitor position sizes fundamentals egregious social violations and trends in social scoring four myths about social investing debunked myth  corporate social responsibility comes at the expense of profit si was designed to identify companies that address social issues as part of their strategies to be more competitive in the marketplace — in keeping with the theory of shared value shared value proposes that companies can improve their longrun position by looking for sustainable competitive advantages including methods of engaging stakeholders on social issues myth  reliable and consistent data are not available the socially innovative investing model addresses transparency and data manipulation by relying predominantly on thirdparty verified data the quality of the data and the proprietary weighting of the model form the central value proposition of the strategy myth  interpretation of social metrics is extremely subjective in our model hundreds of independent data points divided into over  criteria are collected and scored and compared with their peers sector by sector whenever possible we set metrics and ranges as quantifiable targets our model to determine each companys composite social innovation score is applied uniformly companies must meet a minimum rated score regardless of their sector myth  social investing underperforms the broad market the si methodology was designed both to identify longterm value creators and to mitigate risk when sri strategies underperform usually they do so because of poor portfolio construction not social screening to address this shortcoming we utilize us trust® thought leadership for sector overweights and underweights require positive ratings from nonsri analysts on each eligible security maintain a rigorous buy sell and rebalance discipline

strategy developed by us trust is based on a growing awareness that strong corporate financial performance and social responsibility are not mutually exclusive rather they are mutually beneficial qualities for investors si seeks to answer yes to an ageold question is it possible to do good and do well at the same time utilizing the principle of shared value the idea of investing according to personal values and beliefs is hardly new at least since the midth century when quakers banned followers from participating in the slave trade individuals and groups have periodically chosen to avoid investments that conflict with moral religious environmental or other values this approach to investing now often referred to as socially responsible investing or sri is viewed largely in terms of what it doesnt do investors choose what not to invest in — such as tobacco weapons manufacturers and alcohol and because sri entails limiting the universe of potentially profitable investments the implication is that though this might be a noble endeavor the investor is challenged by a restricted investment universe  during the s fortune magazine famously described sri as feel good investing and politically correct investing but as interest in sri has continued to grow a new more active and demanding approach to social investing has emerged based on the idea that social responsibility and corporate earnings should naturally go hand in hand dr michael porter of the institute for strategy and competitiveness at harvard business school summed up this new idea corporate social responsibility can be much more than a cost a constraint or a charitable deed — it can be a source of opportunity innovation and competitive advantage inspired by those words us trust has created socially innovative investing which takes traditional socially responsible investing a step further si incorporates an active proprietary method for reviewing us securities across a wide spectrum of criteria that weight both social responsibility and financial fundamentals to be considered for inclusion companies must be attractive fundamentally as well as fit global macro investment themes established by us trusts thought leadership team during the portfolio construction process sector weights adhere to us trusts recommendation the principle of shared value si stands on the idea that corporations and society dont indeed cant thrive as wholly separate unrelated entities corporations need vibrant communities in order to create demand for their products and to provide a supportive environment in which to operate society needs healthy competitive companies able to create jobs buy local goods from the community and pay taxes where these needs intersect in a zone of shared values is the sweet spot of si it is our conviction that companies that demonstrate and remain committed to policies and practices that enhance their own competitiveness while simultaneously advancing economic and social convictions in their communities not only meet the ethical criteria of socially minded investors but stand best poised to prosper in a pure business sense the framework our framework for assessing a companys commitment to social innovation rests on three pillars human capital engagement how does the company treat all of its stakeholders employees shareholders customers suppliers and the community considerations include such issues as the pay gap between management and employees employee ownership health and wellness diversity and product quality among others environmental stewardship what policies does the company employ for interacting with the environment considerations include greenhouse gas reduction renewable energy use emissions effluents and wastes recycling and others corporate philanthropy what are the standards and procedures regarding its role as a corporate citizen considerations include community engagement community investment corporate giving employee volunteerism and community impact policies measuring a companys actual commitment to these pillars involves a twopart review of stated policies and performance accountability policy review we review benchmark and score policies based on our analysis that good policies indicate good management and are indicators of longterm value creation performance accountability review because good intentions dont always result in positive results we assess companies by how effectively a corporation has implemented its policies and crucially we consider whether it has capitalized on external incentives for good corporate behavior and avoided costly fines and penalties however it is our belief that while quantifying intent and peertopeer benchmarking is important the direct tangible results of the policies must be measured in order to determine their absolute or relative success monitoring and maintaining the portfolio continual attention monitoring and adjustment are required to keep the si properly balanced to achieve its goals we review changes in us trusts recommended sector allocations and periodically rebalance the portfolio we monitor position sizes fundamentals egregious social violations and trends in social scoring four myths about social investing debunked myth  corporate social responsibility comes at the expense of profit si was designed to identify companies that address social issues as part of their strategies to be more competitive in the marketplace — in keeping with the theory of shared value shared value proposes that companies can improve their longrun position by looking for sustainable competitive advantages including methods of engaging stakeholders on social issues myth  reliable and consistent data are not available the socially innovative investing model addresses transparency and data manipulation by relying predominantly on thirdparty verified data the quality of the data and the proprietary weighting of the model form the central value proposition of the strategy myth  interpretation of social metrics is extremely subjective in our model hundreds of independent data points divided into over  criteria are collected and scored and compared with their peers sector by sector whenever possible we set metrics and ranges as quantifiable targets our model to determine each companys composite social innovation score is applied uniformly companies must meet a minimum rated score regardless of their sector myth  social investing underperforms the broad market the si methodology was designed both to identify longterm value creators and to mitigate risk when sri strategies underperform usually they do so because of poor portfolio construction not social screening to address this shortcoming we utilize us trust® thought leadership for sector overweights and underweights require positive ratings from nonsri analysts on each eligible security maintain a rigorous buy sell and rebalance discipline
