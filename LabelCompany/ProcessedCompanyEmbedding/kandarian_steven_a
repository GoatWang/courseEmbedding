metlife first quarter  earnings release conference call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session instructions will be given at that time as a reminder this conference is being recorded before we get started i would like to read the following statement on behalf of metlife except with respect to historical information statements made in this conference call constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to trends in the companys operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries metlifes actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in metlifes filings with the us securities and exchange commission including in the risk factors section of those filings metlife specifically disclaims any obligations to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise with that i would like to turn the call over to ed spehar head of investor relations edward a spehar  headinvestor relations metlife inc thank you brad good morning everyone and welcome to metlifes first quarter  earnings call we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles socalled nongaap measures reconciliations of these nongaap measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable gaap measures may be found on the investor relations portion of metlifecom in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements a reconciliation of forwardlooking financial information to the most directly comparable gaap measure is not accessible because metlife believes its not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on gaap net income now let me call to your attention four new disclosures in our quarterly financial supplement this quarter first expenses and sales for our nonus businesses latin america asia and emea second business segment returns on both allocated and tangible equity as discussed on our december outlook call third operating earnings and premiums fees and other revenues on a constant currency basis and four an earnings  table for corporate and other which was previously only available in our q and k filings we believe these additional disclosures provide greater transparency for our businesses and address some of the questions that we have received from the investor community in the past now joining me this morning on the call are steve kandarian chairman president and chief executive officer and john hele chief financial officer after their prepared remarks we will take your questions also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management including bill wheeler president of americas steve goulart chief investment officer michel khalaf president of emea and chris townsend president of asia after prepared remarks we will have a qa session in fairness to all participants please limit yourself to one question and one followup with that id like to turn the call over to steve steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you ed and good morning everyone we are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of  operating earnings were  billion up  from the first quarter of  and operating earnings per share were  a  increase over the prior year period growth in the quarter was dampened by broadbased weakness in foreign currencies premiums fees and other revenues or pfos were essentially flat versus the prior year but up  on a constant currency basis in latin america reported pfos were flat versus the prior year but up  on a constant currency basis and in asia reported pfos were down  but up  on a constant currency basis earnings were also negatively impacted by the strong dollar operating earnings grew  on a reported basis and  on a constant currency basis we believe metlifes global platform should deliver attractive growth and returns over time but currency translation can be a source of volatility the increase in operating earnings in the quarter was driven by business growth and a rebound in underwriting margins as you may recall underwriting margins were below normal in the prior year period investment margins remain healthy in the quarter with an average investment spread of  basis points for us product lines however the spread was at the low end of the  to  basis point range of the past few years margin pressure from low interest rates was only partially offset by variable investment income expenses as a percentage of pfos continue to trend downward the operating expense ratio was  in the first quarter versus  in the prior year period our goal is to grow overall revenues at a faster rate than expenses and we have sharpened our focus on expense control to help offset the drag on earnings in the current economic environment however we will not forego the investments necessary to become a more customercentric company simply to boost gaap earnings in the near term accordingly we plan to reinvest  million this year to modernize the companys infrastructure and make it easier for customers to do business with us we believe these improvements will generate additional savings and make customers more willing to recommend us to others just as becoming customercentric is a key element of our strategy so too is growing sales of capital efficient protectionoriented products we made good progress on this initiative in the first quarter for example accident and health sales outside the us increased by  involuntary accident and health and nonlife product sales in the us grew by  i would now like to discuss return on equity operating roe was  in the quarter and tangible roe was  however low interest rates and the impact of regulatory uncertainty in capital management are challenges for roe going forward i want to remind you what we have said over the past three years about return on equity and provide you an updated outlook we introduced our new strategic plan in may  with a  operating roe goal of  to  since that time we have provided sensitivities for roe related to interest rates and share repurchases we have said that persistent low interest rates would bring down our  operating roe to the low end of our  to range unfortunately the year treasury yield has averaged  since may  and our current plan assumes rates rising less than we initially assumed we have also said that our strategic plan contemplated  billion of share repurchases from  to  and that no buybacks over this period would reduce roe by  basis points we have been cautious on share repurchases because capital requirements remain unknown for nonbank systemically important financial institutions we have not yet seen draft capital rules and there is no clarity on when those rules will be issued as a result it is likely that share repurchases will be substantially lower than we had assumed in our strategic plan in the first quarter we completed the  billion buyback program announced in december  as an opportunistic buyer we took advantage of price weakness to aggressively repurchase shares at an average price of  per share given regulatory uncertainty our overall approach to share repurchases remains conservative since may  buybacks have totaled  billion or onefourth of the total contemplated in our  roe target belowplan ma activity has also had a negative impact on returns the acquisitions we have made have contributed approximately  million to earnings or half of what was contemplated in our strategic plan metlife has consistently been a disciplined buyer and we will not relax our acquisition standards simply to boost roe in the short term the year treasury yield has been hovering around  the regulatory environment remains uncertain and it is unlikely that ma will contribute as much to earnings as we had hoped with only eight months to go until  we believe it is appropriate to reflect these realities in the roe outlook as a result we estimate that metlifes operating roe will be approximately  next year an  operating roe would mean a return that is approximately  percentage points above the current year treasury yield a  percentage point spread over the year would be close to the prefinancial crisis levels while the quality of metlifes roe has improved largely due to lower leverage and derisking in the us business despite macro and regulatory challenges we are optimistic about metlifes prospects this optimism is underscored by our boards willingness to increase the common stock dividend as you know on april  we announced a  increase in the quarterly common stock dividend per share with this increase our annual common stock dividend will be  per share and based on metlifes current share price the dividend yield will be  we have now raised the common stock dividend for three consecutive years resulting in a cumulative increase of  going forward it is our goal to increase the common stock dividend as our earnings grow turning to regulatory issues i would like to begin by restating one of the core principles that guides our thinking on these matters simply put it is that regulators should preserve a level playing field for all of the companies in the life insurance industry regulators in the united states and europe correctly point out the virtues of competition in an antitrust context we believe that same commitment to robust competition should apply to insurance regulation and for the same reason competition provides consumers with the best products at the best prices we were pleased when the federal reserve recently made clear that it will develop a single capital standard for all of the insurance companies it supervises through a formal rulemaking process if the fed had elected to establish prudential standards for insurers by order rather than by rule the result couldve been different orders for different companies with potentially harmful effects on competition developing capital standards through a rulemaking process will address one threat to competition by holding all federallyregulated insurance companies to the same standard however theres still a risk that these additional capital rules for federallyregulated insurers will put them at a competitive disadvantage to companies regulated exclusively at the state level so it will be important for regulators to ensure consistency across multiple and potentially conflicting capital regimes in closing metlife had a good quarter especially considering the pressure from low rates and the strong dollar looking forward we believe metlife will continue to generate attractive riskadjusted returns on equity finally i am pleased that we have been able to offer higher current income to shareholders by more than doubling our common stock dividend over the past three years with that i will turn the call over to john hele to discuss our financial results in detail john john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you steve and good morning today ill cover our first quarter results including a discussion of insurance margins investment spreads expenses and business highlights i will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital operating earnings in the first quarter were  billion and  per share both up  from the prior year period and  on a constant currency basis this quarter included one notable item in our pc business we had higher than budgeted catastrophe experience partially offset by favorable prioryear development which decreased operating earnings by  million or  per share adjusting for the notable items in both periods as disclosed in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or qfs operating earnings were up  yearoveryear and  on a constant currency basis the key drivers were business growth and underwriting improvement partially offset by lower variable and recurring investment income turning to our bottomline results first quarter net income was  billion or  per share net income was  million above operating earnings in the quarter three items that explain most of this difference are number one derivative net gains of  million aftertax which reflects changes in foreign currencies and gains from lower interest rates number two investment portfolio net gains of  million aftertax as creditrelated losses continue to be modest in the portfolio and these were partially offset by number three charges of  million aftertax associated with insurance contracts and other market value adjustments of the total  million difference between operating earnings and net income we attribute  million to asymmetrical accounting and noneconomic adjustments book value per share excluding aoci other than fcta was  at march  up  yearoveryear tangible book value per share was  at march  up  yearoveryear with respect to first quarter margins underwriting results improved yearoveryear by approximately  per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods this was primarily due to improved mortality and morbidity experience in group voluntary  worksite benefits or gvwb as well as better underwriting in corporate benefit funding these favorable results were partially offset by adverse claims experienced in retail life retail lifes interestadjusted benefit ratio was  unfavorable to the prior year quarter of  results this quarter were negatively impacted by higher than normal accidental deaths particularly accidental falls which we believe is related to this adverse winter weather the group life mortality ratio which now includes add was  in the quarter this was favorable to the prior year quarter of  driven primarily by lower term life claim severity the group life mortality ratio is seasonally high in the first quarter therefore we would expect the mortality ratio to be toward the top end of the  to  annual range the nonmedical health interestadjusted loss ratio which now excludes add was  favorable to the prior year quarter of  and at the low end of the targeted  to  range dental had favorable margins compared to the prior year and plan due to lower utilization we believe lower utilization was a function of adverse winter weather and anticipate some increase in utilization similar to what we saw last year disability was in line with the prior year period and we expect improvement for the balance of the year in property and casualty the combined ratio including catastrophes was  in retail and  in group the combined ratios excluding catastrophes were  in retail and  in group the more favorable retail pc combined ratio reflects less exposure to the northeast which experienced particularly severe winter weather overall pc underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to lower noncat losses partially offset by higher cats turning to investment margins please note annuity spreads in the qfs are now based on total annuities the total annuities spread which includes deferred annuities and singlepremium immediate annuities better depicts investment margins for the business than our prior disclosure of deferred annuities only while investment margins have been resilient we have seen some modest decline in spreads the average of the four us product spreads in our qfs was  basis points in the quarter down  basis points yearoveryear and one basis point sequentially product spreads excluding variable investment income were  basis points down six basis points versus the prior year and two basis points sequentially the yearoveryear decline was primarily due to lower variable investment income and core yields pretax variable investment income was  million within our  quarterly guidance range of  million to  million after taxes and the impact of dac vii was  million down  million versus the prior year due to weaker private equity returns partially offset by higher prepays core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment average new money yields are running roughly  to  basis points below the average yield on assets rolling off the portfolio with regard to expenses the operating expense ratio was  favorable to the prior year quarter of  and slightly favorable to  after adjusting for a legal settlement with new york in the first quarter of  gross expense saves were  million in the first quarter and net saves were  million after adjusting for reinvestment of  million and onetime cost of  million i will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter please note that our segment earnings in the current and prior year period reflected the changes discussed on our december outlook call retail operating earnings were  million up  versus the prior year quarter and up  after adjusting for notable items growth in retail was driven by favorable separate account performance in annuities and partially offset by unfavorable underwriting in life life and other reported operating earnings of  million down  versus the prior year quarter and  after adjusting for notable items in both periods the primary drivers were tighter core spreads higher corporate expenses and lower closed block earnings underwriting while below expectations was only modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter as adverse mortality and life was mostly offset by favorable pc experience life and other pfos were  billion essentially flat yearoveryear as growth in the open block was partially offset by the runoff of the closed block core retail life sales were up  yearoveryear driven by increases in whole life and term the performance this quarter supports our view that life sales bottomed in  annuities reported operating earnings of  million up  versus the prior year quarter and  after adjusting for excess variable investment income in the prior year this strong performance was primarily due to separate account returns which were  in the quarter and lower expenses variable annuity sales were flat yearoveryear as you know we introduced our new vaguaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider flexchoice on february  as the application process is typical for one month vas flexchoice had little impact on first quarter results gvwb reported operating earnings of  million up  versus the prior year quarter and  after adjusting for notable items in both periods growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement in most products gvwb pfos were  billion up  yearoveryear and sales increased  due to strong growth in voluntary products voluntary sales accounted for  of gvwb sales in the first quarter of  and we would expect this percentage to grow from this level corporate benefit funding reported operating earnings of  million up  versus the prior year quarter and  after adjusting for notable items the key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth cbf pfos were  million up  yearoveryear due to pension closeout and structured settlements on closeouts we continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases latin america reported operating earnings of  million down  from the prior year quarter and  on a constant currency basis business growth and underwriting improvement were offset by lower inflation higher taxes and higher expenses in us direct latin america pfos were  billion essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter and up  on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region sales were up  on a constant currency basis driven by brazil mexico and us direct turning to asia operating earnings were  million down  from the prior year quarter and up  on a constant currency basis driven by business growth additionally effective april   the government of japan enacted a tax reform plan that would lower the japanese tax rate by approximately  as a result the company expects to record a onetime benefit of  million to  million which includes an increase in asias second quarter operating earnings by approximately  million in addition we expect this tax law change will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for  by approximately  as compared to  asia pfos were  billion down  from the prior year quarter but up  on a constant currency basis driven by business growth and solid persistency in core markets asia sales were  on a constant currency basis driven by a  increase in accident and health sales in japan in emea operating earnings were  million down  but up  yearoveryear on a constant currency basis driven by business growth as well as favorable underwriting and lower expenses both of which were better than expected for the quarter going forward we believe underwriting margins and expenses will be closer to expectations emea pfos were  million down  from the prior year period but up  on a constant currency basis pfo growth was dampened by certain product and accounting reclassifications in  which had no bottomline impact to earnings but did impact the growth rate adjusting for that underlying pfo growth was approximately  on a constant currency basis driven by strong employee benefit sales in the last two quarters total emea sales increased  on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and ah sales as steve noted we had strong growth in ah in the quarter ah sales outside the us were  billion which was  of total combined sales in latin america asia and emea i will now discuss our cash and capital position cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately  billion at march  this amount reflects the completion of our buyback program the issuance of senior debt to fund an upcoming debt maturity cash contributions to our life insurance captives which we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call and the payment of our quarterly common dividend turning to our capital position the combined riskbased capital ratio for our principal us insurance companies excluding alico at yearend  was  also our japan solvency ratio was  as of december  for our us companies preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately  billion and statutory net income was approximately  billion statutory operating earnings were up  from the restated prior year quarter primarily due to separate account returns and improved underwriting we estimate that our total us statutory adjusted capital was approximately  billion as of march  up  from december  in conclusion metlife had a good first quarter investment margins remained healthy despite pressure from low rates expenses are wellcontrolled and underwriting improved for the third consecutive quarter in addition our cash and capital position remains strong and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value and with that i will turn it back to the operator for your questions questionandanswer session operator and our first question will come from seth weiss with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead seth m weiss  bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning and thank you for taking the question i wanted to just ask some questions on the updated guidance first the new  guidance for  in terms of a interest rate assumption does this contemplate the  yield that you assume is part of your business plan for  that youve laid out in the k or does it assume flat interest rates through the end of the year – or through the end of  steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer hi seth weve assumed lower rates as i mentioned than our original plan that we put out in  for  were assuming  for the year treasury and for   seth m weiss  bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks and if we think about also ma you mentioned that accretion from ma was roughly half of what was assumed back in that original plan when we think about more limited ma than what was planned is this a function of the regulatory uncertainty or a function of availability of opportunities in the market steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer the main thing is remaining a disciplined buyer the regulatory uncertainty has some impact upon that as well in the sense that as a designated nonbank sifi were mindful of considerations in terms of that designation related to our business model so theres some things wed probably be less likely to pursue in that environment than if that environment didnt exist but the main reason why we did not todate acquire businesses with earnings of the  million we were assuming in our original plan of  really relates to being a disciplined buyer looking at the marketplace weve reviewed a number of transactions that were of interest to us but the pricing that was attractive to us to move forward on did not ultimately end up being the pricing that the transactions went for they went for higher numbers so thats the main driver there and let me just mention on the interest rate numbers i gave you those were yearend assumptions for the year treasury seth m weiss  bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you operator and our next question will come from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan please go ahead jamminder singh bhullar  jpmorgan securities llc hi my first question is just on capital deployment and i think steve you had mentioned last time on the call that you given the regulatory uncertainty might not consider doing an immediate buyback after the current one at the time had been completed so now that its done whats your view on potential buybacks through the remainder of the year are you ruling those out or would you still consider them at some point later this year steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer jimmy we have not made a decision yet as to whether or not we would do more share repurchases this calendar year what i said before is that the most recent program was completed more rapidly than we anticipated because we were buying more shares at – when the price of our stock was lower below certain levels so that program concluded more rapidly than we had anticipated and were going to take a pause for a while and reassess things further on in the year jamminder singh bhullar  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then just one question on the japan business you had pretty strong sales in ah can you discuss what drove this is it the new products you introduced last year or something else and to what extent do you view the results as an ongoing trend versus an aberration christopher g townsend  presidentasia region so yes chris townsend here the ah results for japan were up  and that helped lift all of asia from an ah perspective up  for the quarter so we did bring in new products called flexi plus and flexi gold  a little over six months ago and the performance has been very strong since we launched those products so we expect to see continued good growth through the second and third quarter but the fourth quarter will be more challenging from a comparison perspective because we had a very strong fourth quarter  given that we launched these products right at the start of that fourth quarter jamminder singh bhullar  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator and our next question will come from tom gallagher with credit suisse please go ahead thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker good morning steve just one question why the update on the roe guidance right now is it simply youre close enough to  or – im just curious why now thats the first question steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer tom i think you answered it we are now only eight months away from the start of  and we have more visibility obviously not only to this year but our  plan and given where rates are given our view of where rates are likely to be given the ma issue id mentioned before given whats realistic in terms of share repurchases in the current environment related to our sifi designation as you rerun those numbers staying in that  to  range it doesnt look likely and certainly analysts on the street have already baked that into their projections for  roe i think the average that weve seen out there is  for  roe for metlife so i think its pretty well understood how the math works given all these factors most of which are not within our control here at metlife thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker right and i guess steve that was going to be my point too i was just looking at where consensus numbers are and i think most people have figured that out so it clearly doesnt look like that estimates look out of whack but the other question just as a followup to that did you say the interest rate assumption for yearend  is  and yearend  is  those are yearend figures steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer i have to correct myself those are actually average year rates thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay those are average year rates and then one my followup is i guess for chris townsend your strong japan sales particularly in ah was followed by – aflac also had very strong ah sales growth as well is the ah market growing again or are you all taking share from the domestic competitors can you give a little color for whats happening there christopher g townsend  presidentasia region sure the products we launched were launched after fairly detailed customer insights so theyre pretty focused customercentric products theyre effectively hospital cash products with a range of surgical benefits and the way they work is that we have some very lowcost options for certain types of customers and we have some products which are more appropriate for the more discerning customer which have some more specialized covers of so i think the products are fairly broad in terms of their offering which helps to drive growth overall so probably the market for the ah business is growing at about  to  overall so as have been indicated weve got wellpositioned products which were distributing through that multichannel approach which weve spoken to you about previously thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay and not a sense for whether its coming from share – share is being taken from the domestics or otherwise christopher g townsend  presidentasia region yes i think the markets grown probably about  to  were clearly outpacing that growth at the moment but theyre a new range of product so were comfortable with where were at and well continue to drive pretty good growth out of these products for the rest of the year thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thanks operator and our next question will come from erik bass with citigroup please go ahead erik j bass  citigroup global markets inc broker hi thank you can you just talk about how youre thinking about capital return relative to the free cash flow that youre generating and should we view all free cash flow generated as being potentially available for redeployment or does your roe guidance assume that theres some additional capital build at the holdco john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president so this is john and we view ultimately other than an appropriate buffer at the holding company when we find out what the capital rules are that we will be living under that that would be truly free cash flow it is for common dividends for buybacks or for acquisitions so thats why were quantifying that for you now on a regular basis and once we finally know the capital rules we can come up with an appropriate capital management plan erik j bass  citigroup global markets inc broker got it but i guess your revised roe guidance does that assume that there is further capital build at the holdco john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president we are assuming a consistent conservative nature of capital in our projections erik j bass  citigroup global markets inc broker okay and then maybe one question just quickly on latin america can you quantify the size of the loss related to the us direct business and how we should think about the investment being made there in  william j wheeler  presidentamerican division sure erik this is bill wheeler so remember our us direct business is now being reported inside the latin american segment and the total loss for the quarter was up about  million yearoveryear  million i guess just keep in mind that thats different weve now – all the direct activities that metlife was pursuing in the us are now pulled together under one management organization and being reported in latin america so that was a small reason for the decline in latin american performance but we expect losses in that segment as were sort of investing in growth for the remainder of  sales growth is very good there and we dont have the ability to capitalize the acquisition cost quite like we do in our more traditional businesses erik j bass  citigroup global markets inc broker got it would you expect the kind of expenses to continue at a similar run rate or increase as sales volumes pick up william j wheeler  presidentamerican division my guess is if anything theyll decline a little bit in terms of – the acquisition costs will be steady i think throughout the year but the bottom line losses will probably drop a little bit erik j bass  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thank you operator and our next question will come from ryan krueger with kbw please go ahead ryan j krueger  keefe bruyette  woods inc thanks good morning the  million of reinvestment spend that steve mentioned is that in addition to the  million per year that youve already guided to or is that part of the  million john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president that is within – this is john that was within the  million longterm that were seeking for ryan j krueger  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay got it and then on the interest rate assumptions you gave the year assumption i assume theres also some change in the shape of the yield curve which could impact your corporate benefit funding business can you give any color there on what youre assuming john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president we havent given exact details but we are assuming a flattening of the curve if you look at – we based most of this on consensus outlooks and you see the short end coming up throughout the next  months or so up to the end of  ryan j krueger  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay got it and then last one if i could just revisit the question i asked last quarter now that the yearend statutory statements are finalized youve been talking about the statutory capital impact over the last couple of years from being domiciled in new york can you give us any more detail on what the cumulative statutory capital or rbc impact has been to metlife from the stricter new york insurance rules john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure this is john for those of you who enjoy reading blue books youll see on page  of metlife insurance company theres a table that lists versus naic with the prescribed practices required by new york create the difference in reserves and theres about a  billion difference between those two printed numbers however if you look at as weve analyzed the impact of new york and other requirements that they request we follow the total number is actually  billion difference in statutory reserves this would include about  million in reserves because of the fact we did not use life captives so thats within that  billion the other point i would tell you on this is that the  billion difference in statutory reserves has very little tax impact not very tax effective reserves ryan j krueger  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay thanks very helpful operator and our next question will come from sean dargan with macquarie please go ahead sean dargan  macquarie capital usa inc thanks looking at the group nonmedical health loss ratio  im wondering how ltc did within that business was the i guess underwriting performance in line or better than you wouldve expected william j wheeler  presidentamerican division sean its bill wheeler yes ltc did perform better than expected that was one reason that medical health overall loss ratio  was quite good i think another probably equally important reason is dental utilization if you recall last year the first quarter because of bad weather we saw low utilization in the dental area and then a catchup for the remainder of the year and i think its going to happen the same way this year where we saw low utilization because of poor weather especially here in the northeast and therell probably be a catchup for the remainder of the year so thats – look i think the ratio wouldve been – the nonmedical health ratio wouldve been good in any case but these are the two factors that made it especially good sean dargan  macquarie capital usa inc okay and just one followup on ltc in terms of maybe some strategic options because you did write all that business out of a new york company and youre probably better reserved than most and we saw a private capital transaction recently for an ltc block is this something that you would consider selling even if maybe the purchase price wasnt particularly high just to make it go away and never have to talk about it again william j wheeler  presidentamerican division well i would never exclude anything i wouldnt put anything off the table but i dont think thats likely or in the cards our block is significant that transaction was quite small and theres a lot of – in terms of if you think about price increases that weve been asking for through the state regulatory process were having a lot of success there thats helping the block become i think more attractive over time and so theres a lot of state of play there and i wouldnt expect us to leave that on the table and transact anytime soon sean dargan  macquarie capital usa inc all right great thank you operator and our next question will come from the yaron kinar with deutsche bank please go ahead yaron j kinar  deutsche bank securities inc good morning and thanks for taking my questions so first question going back to the roe target the revised roe target now as it pertains to ma so i just want to clarify the  million of earnings as opposed to the  million that was expected that is from ma that was expected from  on so it has no bearing on the alico acquisition or how thats performed steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer thats correct yaron j kinar  deutsche bank securities inc okay steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer we were assuming  million of additional earnings by  from acquisitions when we put the plan together in  yaron j kinar  deutsche bank securities inc okay and steve you said that the nonbank sifi designation has maybe dampened the appetite for some deals that you wouldve otherwise considered or some businesses you wouldve otherwise considered can you give us maybe a couple of examples of businesses that you find less attractive with this designation steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer i wont give you specific examples but you can imagine things that would be considered in the process of designating a company as a sifi those kinds of factors went into our thinking in terms of what we would consider acquiring and there were certain businesses and blocks of businesses that were for sale particularly in the united states that we were impacted by that factor yaron j kinar  deutsche bank securities inc okay and last question steve given that the initial target of  to  by the end of  has come up against a few headwinds that were clearly not foreseen in the beginning of  have you and the board have you had any discussions over the retirement age of  which i think wouldve probably brought to a change at the helm around the end of  have you considered maybe extending your tenure steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer the policy youre referring to is a internal policy for senior management executive management of age  again its not in our bylaws so its something the board could waive if it chose to do so but no decisions have been made yaron j kinar  deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator and our next question will come from randy binner with fbr capital markets please go ahead randy binner  fbr capital markets  co hey thank you just on buybacks and kind of the regulatory piece i understand the comments that your authorizations complete because you still are unsure what will happen with the rules but i guess the question is arent things kind of going in the right direction you got the collins fix the bankcentric draft rule that was a risk seems off the table now from the fed it seems like its possible youre not going to know what these final rules are for some time so id be interested in getting a sense of your increased confidence to maybe have to make decisions on capital deployment if you dont have kind of a final answer on the rules maybe by the end of this year steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer that has factored into our thinking to date in other words we had said we werent going to do repurchases several years ago when sifi designation was still being determined for us and then because the rules were delayed in terms of being promulgated by the fed we took actions in two separate cases of each  billion of share repurchases and we did that because the timeframe had shifted on us in terms of our expectations of knowing the rules so ive said this before its art more than science when you dont know what the numbers are going to be and theres no indications that you can rely upon in terms of what the capital standards ultimately are that you live under so we have taken i think a measured approach in terms of both share repurchases and the issuance of a higher dividend on our common stock in light of what you just said which is the delay in the timing that we were all expecting for knowing the rules randy binner  fbr capital markets  co but i guess the core of the question is i mean do you think things are going in the right direction or are these wins with the collins fix and kind of making progress with the fed is that not material enough to change your decisionmaking process steven a kandarian  chairman president  chief executive officer the amendment to doddfrank that youre referring to that occurred in december of last year is encouraging it gives the fed the flexibility to write rules appropriate for the insurance industry as opposed to their interpretation of the collins amendment which they thought required them to use no less than bank standards in this case basel iii standards even on nonbank sifis so that is encouraging but all that does is give them the flexibility to write rules they think are appropriate for the insurance industry we dont know yet what that methodology will be we dont yet know how those rules may differ from state rules that we live under today we dont know yet how the rules they come up with may impact us differently than the state rules because they may look at certain aspects of our balance sheet differently than the state rules than the asc  rules look at those assets and liabilities today so theres no way for us to really have a good estimate of the amount of capital we need to hold under a regime the fed has yet to put out even in draft form randy binner  fbr capital markets  co all right thank you operator our next question will come from john nadel with piper jaffray please go ahead john m nadel  piper jaffray hi thanks i just had one quick question for you this morning if we look at the core adjusted for unusual items in the annuities segment the aftertax roa if i look back over the past maybe three four five quarters its been averaging somewhere in the low to mids in q its – i think if my calculations correct its about  or  basis points its a huge stairstep just a question for you what drove that is that sustainable is there some outcome there on the expense side or otherwise that we should believe is trendable from here william j wheeler  presidentamerican division john its bill wheeler so i wouldnt think that thats a run rate  million of earnings and theres a couple reasons for that annuities had a number of smaller positive factors this quarter one was separate account performance even though the sp  growth was pretty modest this quarter separate account performance was much stronger the broader stock indexes did much better the bond market did much better remember a big percentage of our assets now in the separate accounts are actually fixed income john m nadel  piper jaffray yeah william j wheeler  presidentamerican division so separate account performance was  and that obviously helped the second thing is investment spread you noticed that actually picked up a little bit this quarter and there were some i would say some more unusual investment income which we dont think is repeatable but theres also – part of the reason the investment margins went up is when we collapsed our variable annuity captive or bermuda captive last year there was a pool of cash which is now being redeployed into longerterm investments so yields are up so thats part of the reason but the other part is some investment earnings which are not sustainable so i think the right run rates a little lower than  million but overall the annuity business is performing pretty well john m nadel  piper jaffray thanks very much operator and our next question will come from humphrey lee with dowling partners please go ahead humphrey hung fai lee  dowling  partners securities llc good morning guys just a quick question on latam – in the press release you mentioned that theres some earnings sensitivity to low inflation and i was just wondering if you can help us to kind of quantify the impact of low inflation in latam and how that affect the earnings outlook if inflation remained low in the region william j wheeler  presidentamerican division yeah so a little background here obviously certain latin america economies historically have been prone to high levels of inflation and its a risk that we need to take into account when we develop an investment strategy in those countries because in a couple of countries we do sell longerterm immediate annuities especially chile and so in chile there is a portfolio of assets where the yields on the bonds is linked to the official inflation rate and the inflation right now in chile is quite low and so that means that the yield on those bonds is near zero and the overall impact – it was actually probably the biggest driver of underearning performance in latin america was this lowinflation phenomenon im trying to get the exact number here well its roughly  million aftertax is what it cost us in terms of the inflation rate in latin america so this isnt just a chile issue but its mainly in chile humphrey hung fai lee  dowling  partners securities llc okay got it and then in terms of the annuity sales outlook you talked about theres a little bit of a timing issue when the flexchoice product was being launched how  the application process to date and the overall sales in the second quarter yeartodate as you reported today has been trending william j wheeler  presidentamerican division yes so applications are good the product is getting good market acceptance we had forecast in  a pretty meaningful increase in our annuity business sales and a piece of that growth was driven by flexchoice it wasnt the whole reason for growth but it was a big piece of it and so were seeing apps trending and were seeing a lot of good sales coming out of that and a lot of i would say recapturing of sales where our own sales force was selling thirdparty business and now instead theyre using flexchoice as their key living benefit rider product humphrey hung fai lee  dowling  partners securities llc so no change to your kind of  increase for  william j wheeler  presidentamerican division we still think thats a good projection humphrey hung fai lee  dowling  partners securities llc all right thank you operator and our next question will come from suneet kamath with ubs suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc thanks good morning i was hoping you could update us on what the current benefit youre getting from the interest rate hedges through – and investment income and how are you thinking about that trending going forward john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president hi this is john we havent given out that specific amount i would say that theyve held up quite well historically and into this year we expect next year to see somewhat of a slight dropoff but we have hedge protection on this going off well into the next decade so into the early s timeframe suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc okay and then just one more on the roe im just trying to reconcile the interest rate sensitivity on the roe to what you have in the k maybe im not thinking about it right but if i look at the business plan that you have in your k and where the rates are versus a  year treasury assumption it looks like a bigger decline obviously relative to your current lowered interest rate assumptions but even if i use that k sensitivity it seems like youre pointing to an operating earnings impact of  million which for a company of mets size is de minimis so i must be missing something on the interest rate sensitivity in terms of why its putting so much pressure on the roe john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay so this is john the k update we give at the end of the year and thats an outlook what happens if rates stay kind of at a low level versus what we assume in our plan our plan had already been adjusted down as steve had indicated to reflect a lower consensus already and the other thing thats going on there which youll see in the segment sensitivities is compared to our plan which assumes a more flattening of the yield curve which reduces sec lending earnings the scenario thats given assumes a steeper yield curve so the long end stays down but so does the short end and so that causes a net benefit compared to the plan so youll notice that in the sensitivities we give and cbf is actually a positive in the rest of the plan so theres really a combination of things its a lower long end rate in that sensitivity but the lower short end rate is a net positive when it comes to the sec lending book of business suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc okay got it and then just one quick followup for you john i think in response to ryans question when he was asking about being regulated by the new york regulator i thought in your comments you had said that part of the differential is that you dont use life captives were you specifically referring to the va or are you talking about xxx and axxx as well john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president that is not including any assumptions for variable annuity captives its only life insurance captives for axxx and xxx suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc okay so you were just referring to the va in other words the differentials not because you dont use life captives you do use life captives john c r hele  chief financial officer  executive vice president we are limited in new york as to how much we can do in life captives so if we were a nonnew yorkdomiciled company we estimate that the statutory reserves could be  million lower by the use of captives for universal life and term insurance that takes into account xxx and axxx reserves suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc all right thanks john c r hele  chief

conference is being recorded before we get started i would like to read the following statement on behalf of metlife except with respect to historical information statements made in this conference call constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to trends in the companys operations and financial results in the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries metlifes actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in metlifes filings with the us securities and exchange commission including in the risks factors section of those filings metlife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise with that i would like to turn the call over to john hall head of investor relations john hall thank you greg and good morning everyone welcome to metlifes first quarter  earnings call on this call we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles socalled nongaap measures reconciliations of these nongaap measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable gaap measures may be found on the investor relations portion of metlifecom in our earnings release and on our quarterly financial supplement a reconciliation of forwardlooking financial information to the most directly comparable gaap measure is not accessible because of metlife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and that derivative gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on gaap net income joining me this morning on the call are steve kandarian chairman president and chief executive officer and john hele chief financial officer also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management after prepared remarks we will have a qa session in fairness to all participants please limit yourself to one question and one followup with that id like to turn the call over to steve steven kandarian thank you john and good morning everyone last night we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of up from a  per share a year ago overall it was a strong quarter across most business segments with favorable results from a variable investment income expense management and underwriting equity markets which rose by  in the quarter as measured by the sp  create a tailwind for earnings well low interest rates in a strong us dollar remain as headwinds adjusting for notable items operating earnings were  per share which compares to  per share on the same basis in the prior year period net notable items of  per share in the quarter including higher catastrophe losses expenses to support our unit cost initiative illegal settlement and a penn treaty guarantee fund assessment these are offset in part by a retail life insurance reserve release as noted in my annual letter to shareholders metlife has a leading position in group benefits with a market share of  among the large employers we are also experiencing strong growth in the midmarket and have over  small employer relationships what we pioneered this business as century ago we consider group benefits an avenue for future growth and highlighted the segment as one of our growth engines and our november investor day during the quarter sales of group benefits were up by  with strength across all market segments and product lines our national accounts sales were particularly strong especially among clients with more than  employees we continue to invest in this business to create differentiated customer experiences supported by strong enabling technology and leading data protection capabilities over the years our group customers have put their confidence in us because of our financial strength and strong service capabilities today theyre also trusting us to protect claim privacy in an uncertain world the macroeconomic environment in the last eight years has affected our business units in different ways our group for example is correlated to the health of the us employment market we have been able to grow premiums and fees in the group business at a compound annual rate to  over the past five years despite modest us labor force and wage growth among large employers all else being equal a stronger us job market would drive faster growth in our group benefits business i have also made note of our shift away from capital intensive indiscernible life insurance in japan this decision was driven by our requirement for appropriate internal rates of return and payback periods for the products we sell the shift in our product mix resulted in lower japanese sales for most in  but we have started to turn the corner in the first quarter  japan sales grew by  which strengthened foreign currency denominated whole life as well as accident  health products although this is too early to declare a trend from a single quarter we are pleased with the overall direction or sales transition in japan metlifes net derivative losses in the quarter totaled  million with interest rates ending in the first quarter of roughly where they started much of the derivatives loss were driven by strength in the us equity markets and costs associated with executing the separation of brighthouse financial as part of a supplemental disclosure weve again included an exhibit that details that firm value movement of our derivative portfolio as promised at meetings with investors throughout the first quarter we are providing on this call an update on remainco metlife hedging strategy we refreshed our hedging strategy to protect free cash flow from both falling and rising interest rates this was accomplished through a process that sought to optimize free cash flow well balancing several key statutory economic and gaap metrics while the restructuring of the remainco hedge program is largely complete the program is dynamic you actively monitor and rebound when market conditions warrant john hele offer more detail on this topic moving to investments variable investment income totaled  million in the quarter of this amount  million is attributable to remainco metlife which is above the high end of the quarterly guidance range of  million provided our outlook call in december private equity investments for the largest contributor to the outperformance in addition hedge fund returns improved significantly from a year ago in the quarter our global new money yields stood at  this comparison average rollout of  over the past four quarters in the fourth quarter our new money rate was  lower yields continued to pressure the life insurance industry i would now like to provide an update on our plan to separate a substantial portion of our us retail business maybe you have asked whether the separation of brighthouse financial will still occur in the first half of  given the complexity of the transaction we do not believe we have the necessary approvals to complete the separation in that timeframe the metlife and brighthouse financial teams continue to work diligently with our regulators in all aspects of the disaffiliation while we did not have an exact estimate of when that work will be complete we are hopeful it will be in the coming months operationally the separation is proceeding on schedule and we have reached several important milestones in january brighthouse financial began to operate as in penn treaty under metlife in march most significantly brighthouse financial began doing business under its own name in april brighthouse financial launched its first broadcast advertising campaign called predictability you may have seen some of the ads during march madness the masters or on squawk box and most recently we finalized a form of financing for brighthouse captive to hold you ulsg liabilities this captive will aid brighthouses capital efficiency and reduce statutory capital volatility looking ahead the next regulatory milestone will be the declaration of a hearing date by the delaware department of insurance we remain confident that the separation will position both companies for success in the respective marketplaces for metlife the separation remains the cornerstone of our transformation to a company with lower market sensitivity in a higher and more sustainable free cash flow ratio turning to regulatory matters i would like to provide a brief update on the governments appeal of the court ruling that rescinded our status as a systemically important financial institution or sifi on april st the trump administration issued a memorandum directing the secretary of the treasury to report within  days of the sifi designation process used by the financial stability oversight council or fsoc on april th metlife filed a motion in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit asking the court to hold the appeal in abeyance until that report is complete as we said in our filing we believe in abeyance will enable the new administration to determine whether any of fsocs positions in this case should be reconsidered and whether it is appropriate for the government to continue pressing the appeal the timing for a ruling on our emotion is at the discretion of the court of appeals before i close i want to update you on our share repurchase program during the first quarter we repurchased  million of our common shares to date we have bought back approximately  billion of our common shares well roughly half of our  billion authorization that we announced in november  we are on track to fully execute this authorization by year end  with that i will turn the call over john to discuss our q financial results in greater detail john hele thank you steve and good morning today ill cover our first quarter results including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins investment spreads expenses and business highlights i will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital in addition to our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement last evening we released disclosure labeled q  supplemental slides that addresses the net derivative loss in the quarter i will speak to these slides later my presentation we will continue to release additional supplemental slides when we have complex elements in a quarter operating earnings for the first quarter were  billion or a  share this quarter included five notable items totaling the negative  million that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement first unfavorable catastrophe experience net of prior year development in property  casualty decreased operating earnings by  million or  per share after tax second corporate  other was negatively impacted by a guaranty fund assessment for the penn treaty insolvency and an increase in litigation reserves which decreased operating earnings by  million or  per share after tax third expenses related to a cost initiative also in corporate  other decreased operating earnings by  million or  per share after tax fourth reserve adjustments primarily resulting from modeling improvements of individual life products which increased operating earnings in metlife holdings by  million or  per share after tax in addition activity related to separation resulted in an increase to operating earnings of  million in metlife holdings and offsetting  million decrease to operating earnings in brighthouse financial finally variable investment income was above the companys  quarterly business plan range excluding brighthouse financial increased in operating earnings by  million or  per share after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs or dac adjusted for all notable items in both periods operating earnings were up  yearoveryear and  on a constant currency basis on a per share basis operating earnings adjusted for all notable items or  up  percent yearoveryear and  on a constant currency basis turning to our bottom line results we had first quarter net income of  million or  per share net income was  million lower than operating earnings primarily because of net derivative losses of  million after tax for more details about the difference between net income and operator earnings please reference page  in our supplemental slide disclosure this quarter page  in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after tax derivative loss as steve noted the derivative losses driven by strength in the us equity market and the repositioning of our hedging strategies for the total company the  million gaap derivative net loss included number one  million or two thirds of the total for asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting which including cost to reposition to remain cohedges to protect from changes in interest rates on a statutory basis number two  million of va hedge ineffectiveness primarily in brighthouse financial including the impact of the transition to their new hedging strategy with number three the balance of  million largely driven by other risks in va embedded derivatives the asymmetrical noneconomic accounting its a recurring feature under us gaap as the derivative assets and marktomarket but a significant portion of metlifes va and life liabilities are not as steve mentioned weve made significant progress at remainco with protecting our statutory capital and thus free cash flow from future changes in interest rates we have obtained further hedge accounting treatment on a statutory basis and restructured the hedges such that our free cash flow percentage is expected to stay within a  to  band on average over two years with a range of the  year treasury rate from  to  as stated in the recently filed form  amendment brighthouse financial has made significant progress in repositioning to its new strategy this strategy targets hedging to the statutory measurement of cte  while also holding a targeted buffer of  billion to  billion the new hedges protect on the downside using a portion of buffer but on the upside potential of the brighthouse financial brighthouse financial believes this new strategy will reduce hedging cost overtime and improve statutory results brighthouse financial and metlife share a common philosophy of preserving free cash flow to the hedging strategies and protecting statutory capital but the circumstances of the companies are bit different brighthouse financial is hedging to cte brighthouse financial has a greater concentration of variable annuity business than remainco and this capital measured better reflects brighthouse financials business this brighthouse financial maintains a large capital buffering it can retain some risk like a deductible reducing hedge costs in contrast remainco has a more diverse business with a lower concentration in variable annuities and no longer rights new variable annuity business in the us book value per share excluding aoci other fcta with  as of march st down  yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of derivative losses as well as the actual assumption review in the second quarter of  tangible book value per share was  of march st down  yearoveryear with respect to first quarter underwriting margins total company earnings were lower by approximately  per share versus the prior quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods underwriting in brighthouse financial accounted for approximately  of the total decrease this is primarily due to the previously disclosed impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit in variable in universal life and the second quarter  modeling changes excluding brighthouse financial underwriting earnings were lower by proximately  per share yearoveryear this is primarily due to higher claim volumes in mexico and the impact of dac assumption change in the companys chile pension business as well as a onetime reserve adjustment in japan in the us underwriting results were essentially in line with the prior year quarter the group life mortality ratio was  unfavorable to the prioryear quarter of  but below the midpoint of the annual target range of  to  this is the second lowest first quarter mortality ratio for group life in  years only the first quarter of  was lower metlife holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was  and  after adjusting for notable items discussed earlier this result was favorable to the prior year quarter of  and in the low end of the targeted range of  to  finally the group nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was  favorable to the prioryear quarter of  and within the  annual target range of  to  favorable underwriting results were primarily due to renewal actions and dental and lower new claims severity and disability turning to investment margins the weighted average of the three products spreads presented in our qfs was  basis points in the quarter up  basis points yearoveryear pretax variable investment income or vii was  million up  million versus the prior year quarter driven by strong private equity and hedge fund performance product spreads excluding vii were  basis points this quarter down  yearoveryear lower core yields accounted for most of this decline overall higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately  of eps improvement yearoveryear in regards to expenses the operating expense ratio was  and  after adjusting for the notable items this quarter related to the penn treaty litigation reserves and the companys unit cost initiative the ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter of  primarily due to the sale of metlife premier client group and expense efficiencies overall better expense margins contributed approximately  of eps improvement versus the prioryear quarter i will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter group benefits reported operating earnings of  million up  and  adjustment for notable items in both quarters the primary drivers were favorable expense margins and strong nonmedical health underwriting results group benefits operating pfos were  billion up  yearoveryear driven by growth across all markets this is the high end of our guidance of  to  which excluded the loss of one large dental contract which will occur in the second quarter group benefits sales were up  with growth across all markets we saw our particular strength in the jumbo case market due to more core activity and higher closing ratios while persistency continues to be favorable retirement and income solutions or ris reported operating earnings of  million up  but down  after adjusting for notable items in the both quarters due to less favorable underwriting ris operating pfos were  million essentially unchanged yearoveryear while one q tends to be the seasonally the weakest for prt transactions we continue to see a good prt pipeline and we expect  to be an active year for transactions of all sizes our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital property  casualty or pc operating earnings were  million up  but down  after adjusting for notable items in both quarters elevated catastrophes net of prior year development reduced operating earnings by  million in both quarters nearly half of these cats were due to hail storm activity in northern texas we have taken steps to address this and as a result of our homeowner policy count in this area has declined  yearoveryear we expect the pace of decline will accelerate to additional rate increases and management actions our pc combined ratio excluding cats and private development with  modestly better than the prior year quarter of  we continue to see improvement in our noncat auto results which posted a combined ratio excluding cats in prior year development of  well below the  in the prior year quarter lower auto claim frequency was partially offset by higher severity as repair costs continue to increase on technologyladen vehicles we have been taking targeted rate increases in auto over the last  months of  to  and expect to take similar lead actions in the immediate future pc operating pfos were  million down  yearoveryear overall pc sales were down  to due to price increases and management actions to drive value turning to asia operating earnings were  million down  from the prior year quarter and  on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters volume growth and lower expenses were offset by higher reserves and taxes due the change in the japan effective tax rate asia operating pfos were  billion up  and up  on a constant currency basis pfos included in the joint ventures and ownership was up  on a constant currency basis asia sales were up  on the constant currency basis in japan sales were up  driven by foreign currency life and accident  health growth other asia sales were up  representing good growth in all markets during particularly by china with the growth of our protection business through our professional agency channel as well as a large group case in australia latin america reported earnings of  million down  and down  on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters the key drivers are less favorable underwriting due to higher claims in mexico and the impact of an assumption change in a companys chile pension business favorable market impact due to better yields in mexico and time as well as volume growth will partial offsets latinamerica operating pfos  million up  and  on a constant currency basis total sales for the region were up  on a constant currency basis driven by strong employee benefit sales particularly offset by lower pension sales in mexico emea operating earnings were  million up  and  on a constant currency basis the key drivers were favorable expense margins and volume growth while unit cost improvement is ahead of plan a meaningful portion of the yearoveryear decline expenses is related to timing and favorable items that are not expected to repeat in subsequent quarters emea operating pfos were  million essentially unchanged from the prioryear period on a  on a constant currency basis driven by growth in turkey as well as employee benefits in the uk and egypt total emea sales increased  on a constant currency basis we continue to see a favorable shift with higher margin products in the region metlife holdings which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long term care runoff businesses reported operating earnings of  million up  and  adjusting for notable items in both periods the key drivers were improves underwriting and market results metlife holdings operating pfos were  billion down  mostly due to the sale of metlife premier client group which included the companys affiliated broker dealer unit as previously guided with operating pfos declined by approximately  in  versus  corporate  other at an operating loss of  million compared to an operating loss of  million in the first quarter  adjusting for notable items in the current period the operating loss of  million this unusually low quarterly loss for corporate  other is primarily due to the incremental tax benefit of  million reflected in the earnings by source table at the bottom of page  in the qfs the incremental tax benefit is acquired by gaap accounting rules to adjust the companys overall consolidated queerly tax rate to equal the companys annual projected effective tax rate as a result it enables the consolidated tax rate to be consistent period over a period it causes corporate  other to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as with the companys effective tax rate respected we expected to be between  to  for  down from  as previously guided the primary reason is the benefit of nonus operation rates lower than the us tax rate of  brighthouse financial operating earnings were  million down  and  of adjusting for notable items in both quarters the key drivers of the earnings decline primarily related to the previously mentioned unfavorable underwriting including  million a loss of the aggregation benefit and  million from the previously discussed q  modeling changes as a reminder brighthouse financial same results within metlifes financial statements do not match the financial statements of brighthouse financial inc and related companies shown in the most recent brighthouse financial form  due to accounting timing differences brighthouse financial pfos were  billion compared to  billion in the first quarter  overall annuity sales are down  and life sales are down  mostly resulting from the suspension of sales through one distributor and lower sales in the metlife premier client group sales of the companys index linked annuity product shield level selector remain strong in the first quarter  at  million up  yearoveryear i will now discuss the cash and capital position cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately  billion at march st which is down from  billion at december st this decrease reflects the net effects of share repurchases payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses please note that first quarter cash at the holding companies include minimal dividends from our operating subsidiaries and we expect operating subsidiary dividends to increase in the second quarter consistent with our prior guidance we expect metlife to receive between  billion to  billion in dividends from brighthouse financial prior to separation subject to regulatory approvals next i would like to provide you with an idea on our capital position our combined risk based capital ratio for our principal us insurance companies excluding alico was  on an asc basis at year end  for our us companies preliminary first quarter statutory results were operating earnings of approximately  million and a net loss of  million statutory operating earnings were up  for the prior year quarter primarily due to favorable underwriting and lower operating expenses the net loss was primarily the result of losses underivatives we estimate that our total us statutory adjusted capital was approximately  billion as of march st down  from  billion at december st the decrease in statutory capital is driven by brighthouse financial with total adjusted capital or tac reduced by  billion this drop was a function of certain restructuring transaction to separation which caused the reserves to be less responsive to equity markets in the quarter several restructuring and capitalization actions are expected to occur prior to the separation which possibly impact in tac many of these have been completed in the month of april as a result brighthouse financial combined tac has increased by approximately  billion since quarter end on a proforma basis as of march st  and to give effect to our restructuring and separation related transactions including those in april we continue to estimate a buffer of approximately  billion above cte  this result in a combined pro forma rbc ratio for brighthouse financial of approximately  as of march   further details will be included in the next amendment to the form  which we expect to file in may for japan a solvency margin ratio was  as of december st which is the latest public data overall metlife had a strong first quarter in  highlighted by favorable impacts in equity markets lower expenses and solid underwriting in the us top line growth was particularly strong with sales up  yearoveryear for metlife as a whole and  for metlife on postseparation basis gaap net income was negatively impacted by net derivative losses two thirds of which were asymmetrical and noneconomic in addition our cash and capital position remain strong and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and driving at long term and create long term sustainable value to our shareholders and with that i would turn it back to the operator for your question questionandanswer session thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of tom gallagher from evercore please go ahead q  tom gallagher good morning steve just a question on the separation youve mentioned the complexity that may delay the timing just a question on that do you still feel confident in the structure of the transaction in terms of the dividends the capital for each business or do you see the delay being more administrative complexity steven kandarian hi tom nothing changes in terms of our expectations other than the timing in the timing i use the word months i didnt use the word quarters it is the complex transaction were working closely with our regulator theres a lot of information to impart we are working very diligently and providing information as fast as humanly possible but it is a large volume of information and analysis that is going on so thats whats resulted in the expected delay from what our initial thought was which was made many months ago over many quarters ago in terms of expectations around timing once you get into these transactions and you see the complexity associated with them you see what occurs in terms of the amount of work that has to get done to make sure that everything is detailed appropriately and headlines appropriately tom gallagher okay okay thanks thats helpful and then just a question on expenses to make sure i have had my head wrapped around these so john if im understanding the flow of the strategic expenses for remainco that would imply you still have another  million to  million left for the balance of the year that would come through operating and corporate that was my first question on expenses and then also on brighthouse i just wanted to get a sense for how much of the kind of annualized  million increase in expenses this year is embedded in the q result john hele the answer to your first question is yes thats why you expect for the year and could you say the second question again i quite get that tom gallagher yeah in the form  it indicates brighthouse expenses youre expected to go up  million in  versus  levels and i just want to understand how much of that planned increase is embedded in the q number is any of that or is a small amount just you know some indication of how much is in the q number john hele probably about  million of that is in q tom gallagher  million on an annualized basis john hele no  million in the quarter its… tom gallagher in the quarter building to like  million quarterly run rate john hele yeah yeah tom gallagher okay so little more than half thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ryan krueger from kbw please go ahead ryan krueger hi thanks good morning my first question was in regard to the changes you made to the derivatives program should we expect any impact to the to your ongoing benefit from some of the low interest rate hedges that would come through that would have been coming through operating earnings steven kandarian theres not a material change to the benefit that we get from those hedges of course rates are higher now so we get less benefit but those are still essentially there ryan krueger okay so no material change other than the interest rates are moving and then just secondly coming into the year you had guided to  million to  million of corporate losses excluding the expense initiative costs does that change now that you lowered your consolidated tax rate outlook john hele yeah so we expect still to be within that range but we do expect the lower tax rate for the year now ryan krueger okay all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jimmy bhullar from jp morgan please go ahead jimmy bhullar hi good morning first i just had a question on the derivatives losses obviously the derivatives loss declined significantly from q but was still relatively large so i was a little surprised with the loss in interest rates and that rates were generally flat or lowered depending on which part of the curve you look at so just wondering what caused that was that related to sales some of that depreciations or something else and then how the gaap loss in on the hedging program affected yours whether it had any effect on stat capital steven kandarian so theres a few things going on jimmy first is although the year treasury dropped a little or almost flat quartertoquarter swap rates were up a little bit so some noise from that thats asymmetrical on noneconomic but you get the gaap noise from that and you also had some strong equity market in the quarter and youve got some gaap noise in that as well we also as we pointed out had some hedge ineffectiveness in the quarter and that impacted the total gaap net income jimmy bhullar and then just in terms of the change is implemented im assuming you change from swaps to swaps and as you had discussed before but is that correct and how if you can discuss some of the other changes that you have made and whether you changed the size of the hedge program whether made it bigger or smaller steven kandarian we actually did a variety of things we were able to get some more statutory hedge accounting for some types of derivatives by changing their technique and structure we did move from two different instruments like that and we have accomplished our primary goal of making stat couple of remainco less sensitive to changes in interest rates and as you can see from the numbers and the breakouts remainco has less sensitivity across the board in terms of equities it is relatively insensitive i mean theres always movements and every time you look at these results every quarter theres a lot going on in a quarter when you have derivatives as well as variable annuities there is the time decay of the derivatives is aging the portfolio your basis risk or otherwise is going to va hedge ineffectiveness and all these get grouped together so there are sensitivities going up and down we minimize that but there always be some move movement here due to all these factors jimmy bhullar okay and then lastly just you mentioned the strong sales in asia and japan i think up to  to what extent do you view this as sort of a turn in their sales since the results had been pretty weak the last few quarters versus maybe some front selling related to the discount rate changes are going into effect in the second quarter christopher townsend so let me touch im christopher townsend here so japan sales were up  yearonyear and this driven primarily by cant see life sale growth were obliviously  as you know we made that shift from the end market volume for july the end of  beginning of  its very strong growth in asia is up  so the foreign currency business now makes up about  of alternative life sales we think that fairly consistent at the mix going forward and as the number of our competitors have pulled the end life products and change pricing for the discount rate range we think asia is being pushed towards a foreign currency life products and were very well positioned to provide that given the distribution weve got so we see that as a fairly interesting team we probably did benefit from around indiscernible product we repriced in april and as you know for the reserve discount price in the financial year and we expect sales with the full often in the second quarter overall were very comfortable in terms of japan sales but its too early to sort of break that guidance at the moment jimmy bhullar thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erik bass from autonomous please go ahead erik bass hi thank you in group benefits can you just talk about the competitive environment and where youre seeing the best opportunities and given relatively strong industry results in recent quarters youve seen any uptick in price competition maria morris hi this is maria morris first of all i just want to say we were very pleased with our group sales results in  its a competitive market as you know its always competitive but having said that id say that life and disability has been rational weve seen a little bit more of intense competition in dental especially down market but overall we feel very comfortable with the market that we are in you probably saw that we had strong growth and strong persistency weve been able to get our renewal actions and overall its been a rational market erik bass got it and then one thing to clarify just on the pace of buybacks should we expect it to slow it all until you receive the dividend payment from brighthouse and im assuming that  billion to  billion is contingent on the transaction being approved and i guess also are there any restrictions to your being in the market around the time of the transaction steven kandarian no we dont anticipate any change in the program that we put in place between our existing cash reserves and earnings we believe were on track for the program being completed by  erik bass got it ok thank you operator your next question comes from the line of sean dargan from wells fargo please go ahead sean dargan thank you and just to follow up on eriks question around the share repurchase as i understand it there was kind of a bright line test that rbc couldnt fall below  and it sounds like whatever happened with hedge losses in the first quarter didnt bring you close to that but is that  applied to the statutory entities related to remainco or are all of the current metlife steven kandarian well rbc as measured once a year and so were half of long term projections that we always knew that theres a lot of pluses and minuses as you do this restructuring unwinding reinsurance transaction to see the pieces moving back and forth and the brighthouse  of rbc we havent done the debt infusion yet from that so theres a lot of moving pieces here and you have to look and if take that into account were strongly capitalized across the board for all our businesses sean dargan okay that would be great thanks and then just on metlife holdings the results were stronger on a normalized basis than i would have thought i mean broadly speaking should we think that in quarters and where just you have  you see favorable equity market performance that metlife holdings will not run off as quickly as you guided to steven kandarian whether its a block of vas in metlife holdings and so for equity markets we had better fees on an ongoing basis and that will continue to be one of the factors sean dargan okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john nadel from credit suisse please go ahead john nadel thank you good morning my question about the group insurance business steve its been a long time since and since i can remember you sort of starting off the conference call talking about or highlighting that business given your size and scale there particularly at the large case market is there anything beyond further economies of scale that you think you could gain from a large acquisition within that business line and relatedly why do you think youre seeing more success particularly in the jumbo case market has competition declined there or have you just gotten a bit more aggressive steven kandarian john the first part of your question we always look at any opportunities out there in the marketplace and the group business is one of which we have a very favorable view going forward and its been a strong part of our company for many decades so if theres opportunities in the marketplace to make an accretive acquisition we certainly be quite interested in looking at that maria you want to take the second part of the question maria morris sure in terms of where weve been investing in group insurance i think were seeing the benefits of our investment in our growth so as an example weve been investing in our voluntary benefit platform and so were seeing large groups as well as medium sized groups really gravitate toward carriers both for their core benefit programs and to offer voluntary benefits to their employees toward a carrier like metlife where were in a position to do that weve talked historically about benefiting as an example from the exchanges where were in some cases the only nonmedical carrier on the health exchanges and i think going forward the other place we really put investments in our ability to ensure that employee records are secure so a lot of work in our security platforms thats been very helpful at market as weve look to bring on new group life and disability business as well john nadel so maria is it fair to say that when you talk about really strong growth in sales at the jumbo case market that a good chunk of that is actually voluntary not employer paid maria morris its actually both i would say that weve had a very strong sales quarter up and down the market so double digit growth in the jumbo market but weve had high single digit growth in the regional market and as you know smart market is actually not seasonally first quarter focused but even there weve had strong growth weve had growth in both our core business and our voluntary business our voluntary business is up double digits from a sales perspective so overall very strong sales quarter group john nadel thank you and then a question for john on the change in the hedging strategy implemented if both brighthouse and remainco can you give us some senses to the duration of the program that youve put in place now and how often some of these hedges need to roll im just trying to understand how the new instruments compare with some of the older hedges im not sure if you even still have them that had extended into the s john hele so on remainco the duration is about the same and its basically some longer term hedges mainly in that brighthouse is like a one to three year type restructuring of hedges that theyre doing and theyve made significant progress to get their hedging done now so if you think about future sensitivities we point out look at the form  that was recently published the sensitivity to va as well as you ulsg in there and you can see both on a stat and a gaap basis with expect to senses should be going forward john nadel no i understand that that disclosure is there i was just trying to understand duration and you know maybe the risk of having to roll john hele so for balances is about one to three years john nadel thank you operator your next question comes from the line of suneet kamath up from citi please go ahead suneet kamath thanks just want to start with the stat capital i guess it was down about a  billion from year end despite not taking any dividends out so john can you just walk the mechanics in terms of why the capital was down john hele is going down  million from  million to  million and as i said most of those brighthouse financial and they had some of the restructuring costs less sensitivity to the reserves the total of cte  which is what theyre really hedging to in their strategy is still as a buffer when we take into account all the transactions that will happen so on a pro forma basis but as of march st you are seeing partway through the restructuring and all the steps that have to happen so youve seen that sort of the low point and is  as i said in my script its up significantly from march st and there will be a whole series of further that have to happen to get there so we gave you sort of the pro forma view of it and expect to be in like a  rbc pro forma for all that as of  if all that had happened as of march  suneet kamath okay and just another question on the update form  to the changes or that the debt to capital of brighthouse is now going to be  and then cte  buffer has gone from i guess around  billion to  billion to  billion so can you just discuss why  what drove those two changes john hele so the first form  all the calculations the values as well as all the core assumptions and projections were all done as of june th last year and the updated form  as of december st and things change a lot between june th and december st so theres a series of changes and i think brighthouse will be a dynamic company and how they manage their business and thats the reason for that still strongly capitalized and will provide good value over time to shareholders suneet kamath okay and just one last clarification question if could on the  roe target for brighthouse is that the guidance for sort of out of the gate or is that more of a longer term expectation john hele i think what happens with brighthouse is for the next little while it is about that type of range because of just how kind of gaap works and there  their key focus is to build up overtime to reduce the hedging cost to start getting cash out of the company and thats the key focus is to run it mainly on statutory basis suneet kamath okay thanks operator and your final question today comes from the line of humphrey lee from dowling  partners please go ahead humphrey lee good morning and thank you for taking my question just to follow up on john does question regarding kind of the appetite for group market acquisition given your capital position like what like what size of the transaction would you be more comfortable doing it with kind of seeking external capital john hele hi humphrey well first of all we certainly will have some capital in reserve for acquisitions but please remember that we do acquisitions of larger size like the travelers deal back in  the alico deal in  we would access the capital markets for any funds necessary above and beyond we hold at the holding company and it is just important to reiterate our philosophy on acquisitions they have to make sense strategically in terms of what we are planning for the company going forward direction in businesses we want to be in and second of all they have to be creative for shareholders and create shareholder value have to earn more than their cost of capital and any point in time when there is an acquisition opportunity we look at the capital markets which of course is to raise capital in all kinds of returns would expect from acquisition including synergies and we make a determination in terms of what were willing to pay for that business humphrey lee got it and then just a housekeeping question do you have any updates regarding the dividends to offer in some of your debt cost right now steven kandarian well we do not believe that this will be a factor going forward we have steps that we can take if we need to adjust for this so thats something that we can plan for if we need to execute it humphrey lee got it thank you operator and at this time there are no further questions so ill now turn the call back over to mr hall john hall thank you everybody and well talk to you throughout the quarter good bye operator ladies and gentlemen this conference will
