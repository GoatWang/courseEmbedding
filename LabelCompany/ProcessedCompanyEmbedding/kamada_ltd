protein therapeutics company focused on orphan indications today announced that the company has withdrawn the marketing authorization application maa for its proprietary inhaled alpha antitrypsin aat therapy for the treatment of alpha antitrypsin deficiency aatd with the european medicines agency ema  following extensive discussions with the ema during recent months kamada concluded that the ema does not view the data submitted to date as sufficient for approval of the maa and that the supplementary data needed for approval requires an additional clinical trial   while the posthoc data provided by the company from the european clinical trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in lung function the ema was of the opinion that an overall positive conclusion on the effect of inhaled aat to treat aatd could not be reached based on that posthoc analysis and that the treatment of aatd patients with inhaled aat should be further evaluated in the

on the substantial data set obtained to date the extensive discussions with the ema and fda as well as key opinion leaders in aatd kamada has a strong understanding of the indication the method of treatment with an inhaled product and the key regulatory guidelines   “while we are disappointed that the withdrawal of our maa extends the timeline for the potential approval of inhaled aat for aatd in europe we remain committed to the continued development of this product” said amir london chief executive officer  “based on the successful us phase  study concluded late last year and the positive lung function data from the european phase  studies we believe that inhaled aat has the potential to be a safe and effective treatment for aatd an area with significant unmet medical need  we appreciate the strong support we continue to receive from patients and clinicians as well as the transparent discussions with the ema and look forward to moving ahead with a us phase  pivotal clinical trial once approved as expeditiously as possible which would allow us to utilize the supplementary data to be obtained from that study in order to resubmit our maa to the ema at an appropriate time thereafter”   “importantly kamada is the first and only company to date that has developed and completed a pivotal clinical program of an inhaled formulation of aat for the treatment of this lifethreatening orphan disease” continued mr london  “we are confident that the significant clinical and regulatory experience we have gained during recent years in the development of our inhaled aat
