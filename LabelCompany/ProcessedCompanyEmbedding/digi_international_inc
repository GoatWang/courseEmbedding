parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

contains forwardlooking statements that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions these statements often can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as anticipate believe estimate looking forward may will expect plan project should or continue or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or similar terminology among other items these statements relate to expectations of the business environment in which the company operates projections of future performance perceived marketplace opportunities and statements regarding our mission and vision such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions among others these include risks related to the highly competitive market in which our company operates rapid changes in technologies that may displace products sold by us declining prices of networking products our reliance on distributors and other third parties to sell our products delays in product development efforts uncertainty in user acceptance of our products the ability to integrate our products and services with those of other parties in a commercially accepted manner potential liabilities that can arise if any of our products have design or manufacturing defects our ability to defend or settle satisfactorily any litigation uncertainty in global economic conditions and economic conditions within particular regions of the world which could negatively affect product demand and the financial solvency of customers and suppliers the impact of natural disasters and other events beyond our control that could negatively impact our supply chain and customers potential unintended consequences associated with restructuring or other similar business initiatives that may impact our ability to retain important employees the ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies associated with acquisitions or divestitures and changes in our level of revenue or profitability which can fluctuate for many reasons beyond our control these and other risks uncertainties and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the united states securities and exchange commission including without limitation our annual report on form k for the year ended september   and subsequent quarterly reports on form q and other filings could cause the companys future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf many of such factors are beyond our ability to control or predict these forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date for which they are made we disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise presentation of nongaap financial measures this release includes adjusted income from continuing operations adjusted income per diluted share from continuing operations and ebitda from continuing operations each of which is a nongaap measure we understand that there are material limitations on the use of nongaap measures nongaap measures are not substitutes for gaap measures such as net income for the purpose of analyzing financial performance the disclosure of these measures does not reflect all charges and gains that were actually recognized by the company these nongaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles we believe that nongaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures additionally we understand that ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect our cash expenditures the cash requirements for the replacement of depreciated and amortized assets or changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs we believe that providing historical and adjusted income and income per diluted share from continuing operations respectively exclusive of such items as reversals of tax reserves discrete tax benefits and restructuring permits investors to compare results with prior periods that did not include these items management uses the aforementioned nongaap measures to monitor and evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and to gain an understanding of our comparative operating performance in addition certain of our stockholders have expressed an interest in seeing financial performance measures exclusive of the impact of matters such as the impact of decisions related to taxes and restructuring which while important are not central to the core operations of our business additionally management believes that the presentation of ebitda from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue is useful because it provides a reliable and consistent approach to measuring our performance from year to year and in assessing our performance against that of other companies we believe this information helps compare operating results and corporate performance exclusive of the impact of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired ebitda from continuing operations is used as an internal metric for executive compensation as well as incentive compensation for the broader employee base and it is monitored quarterly for these purposes for more
