compare the legacy of one of the greatest boxers of all time with abraham who has at least  years of career ahead of himi compare only their fighting style and some other things as both were considered small for their division but they made sure to ko any opponent both considered short and with reach disadvantage but again they made sure to keep ko any opponent both strong as bullsboth have this one punch which can cause a ko against almost anyone chini think that abraham so far might be superior on this one to rocky since he has never been knocked downbut is too soon to tell  defense and stamina both like trains they keep going and goingsomeone said aa has stamina issuesboth defense is very underrated i believe most important both classy and very respectfulcheck the statement aa made for taylor and his injury “i was very sorry when i heard about him spending the night in hospital i want to defeat my opponents in the ring but i do not want to harm them the health is the most important thing and i am very happy that jermain is doing fine it was an honour to fight himnow that i know that jermain is okay i can start to celebrate my success great guy like rocky

abrahams case his power comes in either hand as opposed to marcianos who main weapon was his right hand or susie q as he called it indomitable will you name it he has it sources macehualli

and the stocky frame they both seem to be able to throw punche from all the angles but from what i seen from the tape rocky liked to stand in front of his opponents put his head in their chest and bang away they dont fight like that much anymore seabiscuit ·  years ago  thumbs up  thumbs down report abuse comment add a comment submit · just now its just you again bro but i have to admit abraham is impressive i consider him the best european fighter active today i would like to see a pavlikabraham fight it would be a barn burner for the short time it lasted blogbaba ·  years ago  thumbs up  thumbs down report abuse comment add a comment submit · just now i actually agree with you on this i think they are very similar in their approach to a fight both really have a huge amount of confidence that their will and punching power will beat whoever they take on they both use a constant pressing style it isnt a bum rush attack but its just very methodical  and when they land they try and do damage with every punch i think this is a good comparrison peter h ·  years ago  thumbs up  thumbs down report abuse comment add a comment submit · just now is this a joke they may fight the same style but rocky marciano is a legend and arthur abraham havent proven a thing by knocking out overrated taylor if he beats kessler then we can talk arriba la raza ·  years ago  thumbs up  thumbs down report abuse comment add a comment submit · just now fair comparison i suppose but rockys stamina was one of the best of all time possibly the best for any heavyweight ever and abrahams is ok at best probably closer to questionable john b ·  years ago  thumbs up  thumbs down report abuse comment add a comment submit · just now rocky was not great abraham will be exposedall taylor had to do

messenger close sean ingle seaningle tuesday  november   est first published on tuesday  november   est muhammad ali could talk and jive all he liked his opponent far bigger than any he had faced in the ring was pulverising him during a few feverish months in  ali was stripped of his heavyweight title slung into jail and had his boxing license ripped up all for the crime of refusing to take a single forward step – the step that signalled willing induction into the us army ali insisted he had no quarrel with the viet cong but much of white america particularly in the south did with him they roared for his blood the man had taken his title his liberty and his livelihood and then a machine spat in his face it was murry woroner a short chunky balding advertising executive from miami who was among the first to grasp that marrying fantasy with nascent computer technology was a licence to print money while alis career was being parked in a pallid wasteland for nearly four years the best years of his fighting life woroners was accelerating from first to fifth his idea was simple a fantasy radio boxing tournament to determine the best heavyweight of all time with a twist the results would be calculated by a secondgeneration ncr  computer packed with k of handmade core memory and the icy dispassion of an implacable neutral soon it had  million listeners a flattering  sports illustrated piece entitled and in this corner  ncr  hailed the tournament as one of the most astonishing marketing successes in radio history woroner it added brought to our wondering ears via radio and computer the alltime heavyweight tournament and championship fight he reduced  magnificent fighters from john l sullivan to muhammad ali to keypunch perforations fed them into a national cash register  computer and let them fight the bareknucklers v the gloved sluggers the rigid standers v the dodging dancers the quick v the dead from the computer readouts he produced breathless blowbyblow broadcasts peddled the tapes to  stations the world around and after  elimination bouts let it be known last december that computer fighter no rocky marciano had knocked out computer fighter no jack dempsey in the th round of the finals woroner incidentally was not someone acquainted with hubris we could do more than sports he told sports illustrated much more wars hitlers germany against the roman empire napoleon versus alexander the great how about election campaigns george washington versus franklin roosevelt abraham lincoln against george wallace and debates socrates takes on karl marx thoreau against jeanpaul sartre why not why not but before woroner could solve every pub argument in history ali hit him with a m lawsuit for defamation the ncr s circuit boards had calculated that ali would have lost in the quarterfinals to jim jeffries – a fighter ali dismissed as historys clumsiest most slowfooted heavyweight the government had stolen his title he fumed and now woroner was taking his good name this being boxing an accommodation was reached woroner offered ali  to film a fantasy fight against marciano and he accepted he was short of money and options – i was in the deepfreeze part of my exile and there was no thaw in sight he confessed in his autobiography – and the super fight was born the rock returns  september  rocky marciano knocks out joe walcott in the th round of their world heavyweight title bout in philadelphia photograph corbis by the time rocky marciano faced ali he had not fought for  years he was  balding and had a bad back retirement had been better for his wallet than his waistline the energy burnt with women other than his wife a timid counter to his binges on rich italian food and lack of exercise marciano had remained active in other ways following his final fight against archie moore in  tv presenting product endorsements restaurant chain business sausage company owner even wrestling referee he tried them all he kissed the cheeks of made men and did deals with spaccones who saw him coming from blocks way marciano always feared a return trip to the cloying poverty of his upbringing but m in ring earnings an addicts craving for more and an aversion to paying for anything – he even used wires to avoid putting a dime in public phone boxes – ensured that was unlikely to happen willie pep the great featherweight and friend of marciano once told how he tried to buy a round while out with rocky and some wealthy men in a baltimore nightclub i figured id take care of the next round pep told marcianos biographer everett skehan but then i saw rocky was squirming under his seat the next thing i knew he kicked me under the bar after the pair excused themselves from the group marciano told him im not gonna spend any money and i dont want you to spend any dont make me look bad willie pep remembers rocky was a tough guy with a buck he earned it the hard way and was determined to keep it he had this crazy crazy need for cash his accountant frank saccone said hed reach in his pocket and pull out checks that were all tattered ive seen him give away checks for   im talking big money he didnt even associate that with money to him a check was just a piece of paper but if he had  in  bills there was no way hed give any of that away he believed in green stuff but while there were milliondollar siren calls from promoters marciano resisted the temptations to slip the gloves back on his  record with  knockouts remained pristine and unimpeachable still he missed the spotlight and loved risk which is why the idea of a fight with ali might have appealed – especially when he knew the dice were loaded if you want to live a full life then live dangerously he wrote in one notebook champs are not never supposed to play safe playing against the clock jab and move in another jab and move wasnt something marciano ever practised he was as subtle as a sledgehammer his footwork wrote the associated press reporter whitney martin consists of moving forward in a direct line to a point where he is within cannonading range moore was just as blunt rocky didnt know enough boxing to know what a feint was he never tried to outguess you he just kept trying to knock your brains out it was the marciano way he was a modestsized heavyweight – ft in tall around  st and with a in reach the smallest of all the heavyweight champions – who poweredup his genetics with a fordian work ethic an iron will and a wreckingball of a right hand – his suzie q his left hook was almost as crushing and one sparring partner described getting hit by a single marciano blow as equivalent to four from joe louis no mean puncher himself the pulitzer prize winning writer red smith called marciano the toughest strongest most completely dedicated fighter who ever wore gloves adding fear wasnt in his vocabulary and pain had no meaning while don turner who has worked with the likes of larry holmes and evander holyfield still speaks of marciano with awe my first professional trainer was charley goldman the man who guided marciano he says we used to sit and talk about rocky marciano all the time he had as much determination as any fighter ever there was no quit in him at all he knew what his limitations were and he made up for them by working as hard as any fighter who ever lived once a boxer starts cheating in training he cant be great adds turner marciano never cheated in training out of the thousand or so days that he was champion ill bet he was in the gym and working hard for all but  of them if there was a problem in training camp it was that they had trouble getting sparring partners because marciano hit them so hard he wouldnt even take a phone call during the  days before a fight thats how focused his mind was time has not been kind to marcianos reputation he is regarded as a secondtier champion too small too crude too hittable in his time though he was accepted as one of the greats it helped that he also embodied the postwar american dream if an undersized son of a poor italianamerican shoemaker could make it anyone could the super fight  and now this alltime heavyweight championship fight is ready to go and theres the bell and heres the commentator guy lebow … rock marciano muhammad alicassius clay in this the classic championship fight and uniquely the two only undefeated heavyweight champions of the world im rather staggered by the size propositions marciano about ft  cassius clay about ft  perhaps a little bit more marciano is the shortest man cassius has fought and marciano is looking at the tallest man he has fought … facebook twitter pinterest in july  the month that neil armstrong took one giant leap for mankind and technology marciano and ali stepped into a gym with blackedout walls on the north side of miami and boxed  oneminute rounds they too were supposedly guided by computers marionettes punching and parrying to the whims of the ncr  like the fantasy heavyweight tournament two years earlier the outcome of the marciano v ali contest would apparently be based on data collected from  boxing experts who – according to sports illustrated – had filled in sheets that took  rating factors ranging from the obvious speed susceptibility to cuts ability to throw a left to the sublime hardness of punch killer instinct courage this data was fed into the computer which whirred and chugged before finally spitting out its verdict the magazine made the process sound rigorous and illuminating woroner or lebow interviewed every living fighter … with the exception of gene tunney who declined to be involved it wrote from all this they compiled as encyclopaedic an accumulation of boxing trivia and technicalities as anyone had ever put together they knew how often and where each fighter cut his opponents where he was cut most often himself how many punches and what kind he usually threw in a round what pattern pace and rhythm he preferred what blows hurt him most how many fouls he had committed it was largely spin as ali later admitted in his autobiography there was no computer telling us what to do instead they laboured around the ring avoiding head punches and mostly tapping at each others stomachs a duvet of flab embraced alis midsection and his jabs contained the spite of a wellfed labrador marciano who had lost lbs in case his opponent took liberties was more serious but a new toupee which he believed made him look wellgroomed and youthful further turned this curiosity towards cartoon he looks like an undersized hoodlum from dick tracy at one point the pair were exchanging blows when alis jab flicked the back of marcianos head and scooped up his toupee cut cut cut the camera shouted marciano watch the piece later he asked his friends you dont think hes doing it on purpose no rock his friends assured him its just an accident well hed better start aiming those punches better rocky said rock was really upright about the toupee alis trainer angelo dundee said he had this guy in new york that made his toupees i remember when he got the first one mingia it was terrible it looked like a dead cat i said rocky watch out the thing might get up and run away sadly the scene didnt make the final edit the theatre is further enhanced by knowing that the blood from marcianos cuts to his nose and forehead which he develops in the fight is ketchup wrote ali my glove never hit his face his glove never hit mine … the promoter asks me if i can think of some ending and i plan the one that is actually used i show rocky how to hit me and i fall as though its real we have seven different endings – some with me winning some with rocky winning some segments we fake so good they are left untouched by the editors ali has a point with the knockout sequences which are realistic enough and there are moments where a fight hints at breaking out especially in the th where ali connects with a series of playful flicks that get a snorting marciano swinging widely mostly though the action was sloppy and forgettable i think it was marciano who threw the first real punch woroner said later they had been fooling around when marciano suddenly let one go to the midsection ali followed with a shot to the head but the fighters respected each other and apologized for these slips and afterwards ali commented that marciano had surprised him a friendship was forged outside the ring marciano the bashful white man who served his country in the second world war and ali the brash afroamerican draft dodger found themselves getting on famously through all the fakery something is happening between us ali wrote in his autobiography i feel closer to him than any white fighter in the trade we talk fighters talk in the way only friends can blood talk nittygritty talk our work is phoney but out friendship has become real throughout filming ali referred to marciano as champ and in his autobiography he wrote rocky was quiet peaceful humble not cocky or boastful adding that he deserves his place as one of the greatest of the great heavyweights marciano meanwhile called ali the fastest man on wheels but as the fraud came near an end it was plain that neither of us both heavyweight champions liked the idea of being dramatized as defeated by the other – especially in a fake fight – and we were both on edge admitted ali one afternoon i unleashed a string of lightningfast jabs that kept coming almost the entire round rocky was amazed and said i never seen a fighter with hands that fast the pair separated on good terms a month later marciano was dead when the threeseater plane he was travelling in from chicago to des moines crashed into an oak tree in the middle of a cornfield it was the evening before his th birthday the aftermath muhammad ali was still barred from the ring when the film was screened in  photograph hulton archivegetty images on  january  the super fight was shown as a onetimeonly offering in  cinemas across the united states and a further  in canada mexico and europe the result was more closely guarded than the gold in fort knox according to time magazine but some sniffed the future in the prevailing wind as arnold davis the philadelphia inquirer reporter told ali that computer is no fool you wont submit to white americas old image of black fighters you wont even submit to white americas army youre barred from the ring stripped of the title and on the other hand here is the real white hope the undefeated world heavyweight hero of the postjoe louis days … every selfrespecting madeinamerica computer knows how to add that up you know what they want he added they want your ass whipped in public knocked down ripped stomped clubbed pulverised and not just by anybody but by a real great white hope we need marciano to be able to club you into submission theyll dig up the old heroes to say we had real redblooded white men in those days that could handle niggers like this a white ghost against a black ghost … fantasy – but a lot of people live on fantasy the end is supposed to be a mystery to whom marciano will beat you bloody and it will sell like hell in south africa to say nothing of indiana and alabama others did more than smell the result in advance they knew it as skehan put it one thing is certain rocky never thought he would lose he had refused millions to make a comeback in the ring there was no way he would risk losing a fight to a computer for a few thousand dollars just before marciano died just three weeks after filming his brother peter asked him how do you think youll do in that fight im a winner in  said marciano grinning after the plane crash peter phoned woroner concerned that the end would be changed he neednt have worried the result was exactly as his brother had forecast during the fight marciano was bloodied put down and behind on points before coming back to win by knockout in the th round – an unimaginative regurgitation of his first championship bout with jersey joe walcott ali watched the fight in a crowded philadelphia picture house saw his left arm sagging on the middle rope as marciano lifted his hands in celebration as the computer delivered its verdict rocky marciano wins by ko in  seconds knockout came on a combination of two rights and a left hook muhammad ali though game could not withstand marcianos final attack ali did not land a single effective punch this round and he felt shame i saw myself on the ropes being destroyed by marciano in one of the artistic endings few actors could equal he wrote but some people thought it was real some sat stonestill some booed and yelled some cried … i felt like i had disappointed millions all over the world it left me ashamed of what i had been doing i had gone over the country promoting the series as fair and accurate especially the marciano v ali show his trainer angelo dundee was more sanguine to err is a machine he joked why did people believe the whole grand sham partly because they wanted to of course but this was also the era when man shot for the stars and moonwalking was a reality not a dance technology was taking on allcomers and winning its dimensions were uncertain its boundaries unclear – perhaps using it to solve sporting hypotheticals wasnt so farfetched of course the super fight didnt settle the debate it merely reset it it matters little but in a hypothetical ali v marciano encounter most would make a prime ali – the ali that dismantled cleveland williams before inactivity snatched much of the skip and slip from his legs – a strong favourite but marciano would have had a punchers chance and he certainly was a puncher speaking to howard cossell on the wild world of sports in  ali paid his friend and acting partner a generous tribute saying ooh he hit hard … but i truly think on my best day and his best day i would have beaten him probably not knocked him out i think he was better than joe frazier put it that way and you know what joe frazier did to me he wasnt as great as me he wasnt as beautiful as me – everybody know that he added but i dont know whether i could have beaten him with his style of boxing he could have outpointed me he could have knocked me down i did a computer fight with him when he was an old man and just pretending and my arms were sore just from joking with him after the film was shown ali called the super fight a sham and a hollywood fake on the dick cavett show he was right even so woroner responded with a m lawsuit claiming that another computer fight – this time involving sugar ray robinson and the frenchman marcel cerdan – had fallen through because sugar ray had lost faith in the computer soon everyone else had too in september  the ncr  predicted that joe frazier would suffer a sixround defeat to bob foster in their forthcoming heavyweight title fight no one else did for frazier was lbs heavier and swarming towards his prime the fight was a mismatch frazier stalked his prey before connecting with a left hook of such velocity that it twisted fosters body like a spinning top and injured his ankle before knocking him out  seconds into the second round reality had caught up with fantasy woroners idea was bust but with the super fight having taken at least m in gate receipts he walked away a rich man ali meanwhile was getting ready to head out of exile and fight for real again the last great age of the heavyweights was about to begin topics boxing the forgotten story of muhammad ali blogposts share on facebook share on twitter share via email
