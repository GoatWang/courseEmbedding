turner resetaa font size print court of appeals of kentucky terry williams appellant v ralph william turner individually and in his capacity as executor of the estate of james frank turner ralph william turner individually and in his capacity as executoradministrator of the estate of evelyn turner the estate of james frank turner and the estate of evelyn turner appellees no –ca––mr     decided june   before stumbo taylor and thompson judgesjonathon c lee harlan ky for appellant otis doan jr harlan ky for appellees opinionterry williams appeals from findings of fact conclusions of law and judgment of the harlan circuit court dismissing as untimely his complaint to enforce a claim against decedents estate williams sought to enforce against the estate of james frank turner a land contract to purchase a parcel of real property situated in harlan county kentucky in dismissing the action special judge james l bowling jr determined that williams complaint was not filed within  days after the mailing of a notice of disallowance as required by krs  we conclude that williams never served the estate or its executor and find as ineffectual his service on an attorney who represented the executor in a separate proceeding in district court accordingly we affirm the judgment on appealon september   terry williams filed a claim in harlan district court as creditor against the estate of james frank turner the claim alleged that williams entered into a land contract to purchase a parcel of real property from james turner “mrturner” and his wife evelyn turner “mrsturner” the turners died about one week apart in january on january   ralph william turner in his capacity as executor of mr turners estate moved for leave to deny the claim after williams did not appear or otherwise respond to the motion the harlan district court granted the motion and williams claim was denied williams did not file a claim against the estate of mrs turnerwilliams claim against the estate was denied by way of a letter mailed to him on january   on march   williams filed the instant complaint to enforce a claim against decedents estate against ralph turner both individually and as executor and against the james frank turner estate williams alleged that in consideration for valued work he performed for mr and mrs turner williams was to receive various payments including one lot of land owned by the decedents as well as various water rights williams sought a judgment in the amount of  as well as specific performance of the land contract and attorney feeson april   ralph turner et al moved to dismiss the complaint as a basis for the motion turner argued that williams had provided insufficient process insufficient service of process failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and noncompliance with krs  with respect to the statutory argument turner maintained that williams did not commence the action within  days of the written notice denying the claim specifically turner argued that commencement of an action occurs only with the filing of the complaint and the issuance of a proper summons and delivery by the sheriff turner maintained the delivery of the complaint by a constable and without a summons upon hon sidney b douglass attorney for the estate of james frank turner in the prior district court proceeding was not proper service additionally turner maintained that mr douglass was without authority to accept service for the estate or its executor and that a complaint may be served only by the sheriff or certified mail and not by a constableafter hearing arguments on the motion the harlan circuit court rendered its findings of fact conclusions of law and judgment sustaining the motion on january   in support of the judgment the court determined that when williams filed the complaint on march   four summons were issued at that time by the harlan circuit court clerks office and given to plaintiffs counsel the court found that delivery of the complaint was attempted on mr douglass by constable and was not accompanied by a summons it further found that it was only on april   and after the motion to dismiss and motion to quash service of process were filed that plaintiffs counsel served the complaint and summons on mr douglass by utilizing the sheriff additionally the court determined that at no time was the defendant ralph william turner personally served by any means in either his individual capacity or in his capacity as executorin applying krs  to the foregoing the harlan circuit court determined that the action was not commenced within the  day statutory period and therefore was timebarred the action was dismissed and this appeal followedwilliams now argues that the harlan circuit court erred in sustaining the appellees motion to dismiss he first maintains that service upon hon sidney douglass was proper as douglass was the attorney of record for the estate of james frank turner and for executor ralph william turner williams also argues that krs  does not designate any other individual as agent for service of process in this circumstance he notes that as executor ralph william turner is a resident of raleigh north carolina and because krs  requires a designated agent in the kentucky county where the probate administration is pending service upon douglass was proper and the trial court erred in failing to so concludewe find no error in the harlan circuit courts conclusion that attorney douglass was not a proper agent to receive process on behalf of the estate or for ralph william turner either individually or in his capacity as executor krs  governs the appointment of a personal representative in probate matters and states in relevant part thatthe application of a nonresident shall include the designation of a resident of the county where administration is pending as his agent for the service of process in any action against him as personal representative or personally provided that such personal action must have accrued in the administration of the estatewilliams acknowledges that douglass was not designated as agent for the service of process he contends however that douglass “became” the agent because no agent was otherwise designated as required by the statute and because executor ralph william turner resided in raleigh north carolina we do not find this argument persuasive and cannot conclude that a partys counsel becomes the de facto service agent by default when the statutory designation has not been met williams points to no case law or other authority that transforms legal counsel into a legal representative for service of process as required by krs furthermore douglass represented turner and the estate in harlan district court probate proceedings but not in the instant action this means that williams sought to accomplish service on turner and the estate in the instant action by serving turners counsel in a separate action in a different court we find no basis in the law for accomplishing service in this manner“an action shall be deemed to commence on the date of the first summons or process issued in good faith from the court having jurisdiction of the cause of action” krs  see also kentucky rules of civil procedure cr  which provides that a “civil action is commenced by the filing of a complaint with the court and the issuance of a summons or warning order thereon in good faith” in the absence of a showing of a valid excuse for a delay a summons issued by the clerk and delivered to the plaintiff is not deemed to have been “issued in good faith” within meaning of krs  and cr  until the summons is given to the sheriff or other proper officer to be served wooton v begley  sw d  ky in the matter at bar however turner was never served either individually nor in his capacity as executor and no warning order was issued the good faith analysis described in wooton is implicated when there is a delay in serving the defendant “the question then is whether wooton can be considered as having caused the summons to be issued in good faith when he held it for three days beyond the limitation period without delivering it to the sheriff for service” wooton  swd at in the matter before us however we never reach the question of whether a delay in delivering the summons was made in good faith as turner was never served because he was out of state and no warning order was issued implicit in the statute and civil rule we believe is the notion that the summons must be directed to the defendant and to a place he can be served that did not happen herein as the summons were directed to the office of attorney douglass thus and arguendo even if the instant action were properly commenced by operation of krs  and cr  turner was never served no warning order was issued and for the reasons stated above we cannot conclude that douglass was turners process agentthe appellees motion to dismiss was grounded on cr  and their claim that the action failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted since such a motion is a pure question of law a reviewing court owes no deference to a trial courts determination and reviews the issue de novo littleton v plybon  swd   kyapp even when considering the pleadings in a light most favorable to williams id we find no error in the harlan circuit courts determination that williams did not commence the underlying action within the statutory period as the defendant in this action was never served directly or through an agent nor brought within the jurisdiction of the court by the issuance of a warning order the matter was properly dismissed for the foregoing reasons we affirm the findings of fact conclusions of law and judgment of the harlan circuit courtrespectfully i dissent i believe the timely filing of a complaint good faith issuance of summons and delivery to a constable for service of process upon douglass was sufficient to commence the cause of action in this case all occurred within  days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance of williams claimafter filing the complaint on march   and the issuance of the summonses williams counsels office immediately tendered the complaint to a constable who then immediately served the complaint upon mr douglass inadvertently the summonses were not served with the complaint turner contends service was improper because it was served by a constable no summons was served and douglass was not designated to receive service of processalthough the result reached by the majority is premised only on the conclusion that douglass was not turners process agent i briefly address turners remaining contentions and first clarify a constable is authorized by statute to serve process krs  providesconstables may execute warrants summons subpoenas attachments notices rules and orders of court in all criminal penal and civil cases and shall return all process placed in his hands to the courts or persons issuing them on or before the return day noting the time of execution on themmoreover a nonresident applicant petitioning to be appointed as personal representative of a probate estate must designate a resident of the county where administration of the estate is pending as agent for service of process in any action against him as personal representative or personally krs  here turner did not designate an agent for service of process therefore i am convinced that douglass as counsel of record and resident of the county of administration became the proper agent for service of process for matters relating to the estatekentucky rules of civil procedure cr  provides “a civil action is commenced by the filing of a complaint with the court and the issuance of a summons or warning order thereon in good faith” good faith in the rules context indicates “something less than perfection or complete accuracy above all it means not to take advantage of not to deceive not to be underhanded” roehrig v merchants  businessmens mut ins co  swd   ky “if when the summons was issued the plaintiff had a bona fide unequivocal intention of having it served presently or in due course or without abandonment the summons was issued in good faith” id at there is no evidence that turner lacked good faith under the facts presented i would reversefootnotes  cr  addresses constructive service it provides that “if a party sought to be summoned is a an individual who is a nonresident of this state and known or believed to be absent therefrom ․ the clerk shall forthwith subject to the provisions of rule  make an order upon the complaint warning the party to appear and defend the action within  days”  record at p stumbo judge taylor judge concurs thompson judge
