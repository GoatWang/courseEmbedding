of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as well as our annual report on form k for the year ended december   overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed in april  by enervest to acquire produce and develop oil and natural gas properties our general partner is ev energy gp a delaware limited partnership and the general partner of our general partner is ev management a delaware limited liability company we operate in one reportable segment engaged in the acquisition development and production of oil and natural gas properties and all of our operations are located in the united states as of march   our oil and natural gas properties were located in the barnett shale the san juan basin the appalachian basin which includes the utica shale michigan central texas which includes the austin chalk area the monroe field in northern louisiana the midcontinent area in oklahoma texas arkansas kansas and louisiana and the permian basin as of december   we had estimated net proved reserves of  mmbbls of oil  bcf of natural gas and  mmbbls of natural gas liquids or  bcfe and a standardized measure of  million current price environment oil natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically these prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile in late  prices for oil natural gas and natural gas liquids declined precipitously and prices remained low through  and most of  while prices showed some improvement during the second half of  and the beginning of  they have continued to fluctuate factors contributing to lower oil prices include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions of the world particularly the middle east lower forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with excess global supply actions taken by the organization of petroleum exporting countries and the strength of the us dollar in international currency markets factors contributing to lower natural gas prices include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities higher levels of natural gas in storage and competition from other energy sources prices for natural gas liquids generally correlate to the price of oil and accordingly prices remain lower than historical levels and are likely to continue to directionally follow the market for oil in the three months ended march   these low prices negatively affected our revenues earnings and cash flows and continued volatility in prices for oil natural gas and natural gas liquids could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity continued volatility or further declines in prices could also have a significant adverse impact on the value and quantities of our reserves assuming no other changes in our development plans as specified by the sec the prices for oil natural gas and natural gas liquids used to calculate our reserves were the average prices during the year determined using the price on the first day of each month the prices utilized in calculating our total estimated proved reserves at december   were  per bbl of oil and  per mmbtu of natural gas which was significantly lower than forward strip prices had we used the forward strip prices at december   through december   we estimate that the present value discounted at  per annum of estimated future net revenues of our proved reserves would have been approximately  higher and that our reserves on an mcfe basis would have been approximately  higher than our reserves calculated using sec prices our response to the current price environment given current forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production hedged at lower prices beginning in  relative to previous years we have taken additional steps going forward into  to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility these steps include � focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating and capital costs � increasing our capital spending budget to    million from  million in  in an effort to maintain current production levels � maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment which includes continuing to assess the appropriate distribution levels every quarter � continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of longlife producing oil and natural gas properties such as our eagle ford acquisition in january  and � further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of capital including farmouts production payments and joint ventures or potential monetization of acreage during  the board of directors of ev management elected to suspend distributions to unitholders for all four quarters of  the board of directors also elected to suspend distributions for the first quarter of  the company continues to generate positive distributable cash flow albeit at significantly lower levels than in previous years the board of directors will continue to evaluate on a quarterly basis and may elect to reinstate the distribution at the appropriate time when commodity prices and operating cash flows have increased to a level that can support a sustainable distribution as of may   we have  million outstanding under our credit facility and  million of our senior notes due  outstanding for a total of  million and we have over  million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity and cash on hand please see note  to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in item  condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited contained herein for additional information regarding our liquidity business environment one of our primary business objectives is to generate sufficient excess cash flow that will allow us to reinstate a stable distribution which we will grow over time the amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash generated from our operations which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on among other things � the prices at which we will sell our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production � our ability to hedge commodity prices � the amount of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas we produce and � the level of our operating and administrative costs in order to mitigate the impact of lower prices on our cash flows we are a party to derivatives and we intend to enter into derivatives in the future to reduce the impact of price volatility on our cash flows although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our future production through march  a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices at which we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future we have mitigated but not eliminated the potential effects of changing prices on our cash flows from operations for those periods an extended period of depressed commodity prices would alter our acquisition and development plans adversely affect our growth strategy and our ability to access additional capital in the capital markets and reduce the cash we have available to pay distributions which may require us to further delay our ability to reinstate our quarterly distribution the primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability our ability to make accretive acquisitions the success of our drilling program and our inventory of drilling prospects in addition as initial reservoir pressures are depleted production from our wells decreases we attempt to overcome this natural decline through a combination of drilling and acquisitions our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions in excess of production we will maintain our focus on the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals any delays in drilling completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact our production which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and as a result cash available for distribution we focus our efforts on increasing our reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for longterm operations our future cash flows from operations are dependent upon our ability to manage our overall cost structure

increase in impairment of oil and gas properties partially offset by a  million increase in total revenues a  million favorable change in gain on derivatives and a  million decrease in lease operating expenses oil natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for the three months ended march   totaled  million an increase of  million compared with the three months ended march   this was the result of an increase of  million related to higher prices offset by a decrease of  million primarily related to decreased natural gas and natural gas liquids production lease operating expenses for the

dda rate per mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates dda was  per mcfe in the three months ended march   compared with  per mcfe in the three months ended march   general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march   totaled  million a decrease of  million compared with the three months ended march   this decrease is primarily the result of  million of lower equity compensation costs and  million of lower fees paid to enervest under the omnibus agreement general and administrative expenses were  per mcfe in the three months ended march   compared with  per mcfe in the three months ended march   in the three months ended march   we incurred proved property impairment of  million related to oil and natural gas properties located in the midcontinent area and the permian basin and leasehold impairment charges of  million in the three months ended march   we incurred leasehold impairment charges of  million gain on derivatives net was  million for the three months ended march   compared with  million for the three months ended march   this change was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices the  month forward price at march   for oil averaged  per bbl compared with  at december   and the  month forward prices at march   for natural gas averaged  per mmbtu compared with  at december   the  month forward

the three months ended march   decreased  million compared with the three months ended march   due to  million from a lower weighted average longterm debt balance partially offset by  million from a higher weighted average effective interest rate liquidity and capital resources historically our primary sources of liquidity and capital have been issuances of equity and debt securities borrowings under our credit facility and cash flows from operations our primary uses of cash have been acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and related assets development of our oil and natural gas properties distributions to our unitholders and general partner and working capital needs in response to continued price volatility we have taken a number of actions to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility and as of may   we have over  million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity and cash on hand however given current forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production hedged at lower prices beginning in  relative to previous years we have taken additional steps going forward into  to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility these steps include those outlined in overviewour response to the current price environment for  we believe that cash on hand proceeds from sales of assets net cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our capital budget and satisfy our shortterm liquidity needs we may also utilize borrowings under our credit facility and various financing sources available to us including the issuance of equity or debt securities through public offerings or private placements to fund our acquisitions and longterm liquidity needs our ability to complete future offerings of equity or debt securities and the timing of these offerings will depend upon various factors including prevailing market conditions and our financial condition longterm debt as of march   we have a  billion credit facility that expires in february  borrowings under the facility may not exceed a borrowing base determined by the lenders based on our oil and natural gas reserves as of march   the borrowing base was  million and we had  million outstanding in april  the borrowing base was decreased to  million although the borrowing base under the credit facility was reduced we believe we will maintain sufficient liquidity however should prices decline significantly from current levels the borrowing base could be reduced again in future redeterminations which would impact our liquidity at the end of first quarter of  the leverage covenant in our credit agreement changes from a senior secured debt to ebitdax ratio to a total debt to ebitdax ratio based on current forward commodity prices at the end of first quarter of  we project that we would likely have a total debt to ebitdax ratio in excess of the level prescribed in the most recent ninth amendment of our credit agreement and therefore we would not be in compliance with our leverage covenant at the end of the first quarter of  noncompliance with this covenant would be an event of default and could result in the acceleration of all our indebtedness under the credit agreement if the lenders under the credit agreement were to accelerate the loans outstanding thereunder we would also be in default under the indenture governing the senior notes in which case the lenders under the indenture could accelerate repayment of the senior notes and we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts due under the credit agreement and senior notes as of march   we have  million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our  senior notes due april  as of march   the aggregate carrying amount of the senior notes due  was  million as of may   we have  million outstanding under our credit facility and  million of our senior notes due april  outstanding for a total of  million for additional information about our longterm debt such as interest rates and covenants please see item  condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited contained herein cash and
