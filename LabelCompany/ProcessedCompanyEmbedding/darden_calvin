landon thomas jrjan   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story at the celebritypacked wedding of star jones reynolds the television talk show host last november calvin r darden jr seemed on top of his game with his flashing smile and his perpetually trilling cellphones mr darden a yearold stockbroker worked the reception area at the waldorfastoria  huddling with dave winfield the former baseball star bantering with samuel l jackson the actor and introducing the actress angela bassett a former client to a friend of hisfor mr darden who knew the groom al scales reynolds from their early days as merrill lynch brokers it was the same heady blend of celebrity glitz and wall street money that had fueled his rapid career ascentbut a month later his fantasylike world of fast cars basketball stars and highstakes finance would shatter when the manhattan district attorney announced his indictment accusing him of stealing  million from some of his previous firms  smith barney wachovia and aic ltd one of canadas largest mutual fund companies  as well as an yearold womanaccording to the indictment mr darden used the money from the elderly investor to splurge on a multimilliondollar home in glen cove ny to which he then added a  aquarium stocked with sharks and a movie theater that cost at least that much if convicted mr darden whose father is a top executive at united parcel service could serve up to  years in state prison advertisement continue reading the main story as if that were not enough mr darden is facing the possibility of two other lawsuits one would be from nelly the hiphop star who invested  with mr darden in  that remains unaccounted for according to people who have been briefed on the case the other would be from latrell sprewell the nba star who says he gave mr darden  to invest last fall after a chance meeting six months after mr darden had been fired from his last job that sum too has not been returned according to mr sprewells representative continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the story of calvin ramarro darden jr seems outsized in nearly every way from the accusations leveled to the personalities involved in a civil case that preceded the indictment last year wachovia and aic contended that mr darden had forged documents and promised  yet failed to deliver  a client roster that included shaquille oneal mr sprewell ms bassett and mr jackson as well as more than  senior ups executives according to mrs reynolds neither she nor her husband who remains at merrill ever had financial relationships with mr dardenmr darden who turned himself in to the authorities and is free on  million bail  put up by his father  declined to comment for this article his next scheduled court appearance is on feb  but he could be summoned to court as soon as this week a person familiar with the case said he is trying to replace his original lawyer with a higherprofile criminal attorney among those he has spoken with is benjamin brafman who has represented p diddy and michael jackson i dont see in calvin a young man who woke up one morning and decided to be a criminal said mr brafman who emphasized that he has yet to accept the caseno one disputes that mr darden started out with the best intentions to be a successful broker but as his string of deceptions grew people involved in the investigation say mr dardens actions took on the quality of a ponzi schemeas his business career began to fail these people say he would take money from one investor to pay off the next until the whole enterprise eventually collapsed these people say that a  million loan from aic for example went to pay off cheryl james another onetime client of mr dardens and a member of the rap duo saltnpepa and that the  from mr sprewell went to the yearold investorequally astonishing though is how large financial institutions could lend mr darden a broker with less that six years of experience and a belowaverage production record  million in six months without closely examining his finances his career history or whether the celebrities were actually his clientswall street firms have been desperate to diversify their overwhelmingly white ranks and to tap into the lucrative niche of africanamerican entertainers to that end firms have engaged in bidding wars for brokers with ties to these celebritiesmr darden was clearly caught up in the swirl he was ambitious and savvy enough to drop a name like shaq and take the millions thrown at him in return but unable to cement enduring financial relationships advertisement continue reading the main story many aspects of the case remain unexplained while the civil suit against mr darden states that he never delivered his list of famous clients nelly and mr sprewell gave him  million to invest that has not been returnedbut the fallout has been brutal reinforcing pernicious racial stereotypes former associates saysome people are so enthralled with celebrity they will do anything to get a piece of it said marvet britto a publicist who represents mr sprewell and has represented mrs reynolds and ms bassett you can have enormous talent but at some point your integrity needs to step in ms britto said unfortunately as africanamericans there is always a microscope on what we do something like this sets us backmr darden stands a strapping foot his baby face and eagertoplease demeanor give him the quality of a high school valedictorian an avid churchgoer he prays each morning and night his friends say adding that he has donated more than  to charitiesstill his love for the high life is undisguised besides his  million mansion he owns a lamborghini murciélago a mercedesbenz  and a porsche turbothose familiar with mr dardens case liken him to stephen glass the writer for the new republic whose string of artfully conceived yet mostly madeup magazine articles resulted in a successful career as a journalist before his employers discovered his deceptions like mr glass they say mr darden has an almost desperate quality to tell people what they want to hear  whether they are his parents his employers or the homeless person on the street to whom he gave  in cash late last yearmr dardens friends say that he was courted aggressively by financial firms since his days as a student at morehouse college he seemed an ideal candidate in many ways his father who had started as a loader at ups and had risen to senior vice president of its united states operations had become one of the most wellregarded africanamericans in corporate america his father will retire this spring and is expected to step down from the ups board as well he remains a director at target and cocacola enterprisesin  after a year at salomon brothers the junior mr darden joined merrill lynch and aced the training program there his friends say but he had an unexceptional career at merrill lynch those familiar with his employment there say with the bulk of his business deriving from his fathermr dardens career at merrill shifted into overdrive when ups went public in november  suddenly his father and his fellow executives many of whom the younger mr darden had known for years became millionaires raising his profile both inside and outside the firm recruiters saw in him a promising young broker with rich corporate and celebrity relationships who could also lend a muchneeded dash of racial diversity they wined and dined him at new yorks best restaurants and strip clubs advertisement continue reading the main story according to associates of mr darden the one name he mentioned more than others was shaquille oneal such relationships gave him instant credibility in pitching his services as a money manager to africanamerican entertainers in fields from sports to music among the clients he claimed to represent were the neptunes the hiphop production team that represents snoop doggbut people familiar with the case say he never had a business relationship with mr oneal shaq was the carrot said ms britto who said she met mr darden through one of her clients cuttino mobley the nba player cuttino said this guy is amazing he made shaq millions of dollars plus calvin was instantly legitimized by his fathers name that got him in the doormr oneals agent did not return calls asking for commentsmith barney won the derby and mr darden joined it in  receiving what would be his first socalled signon bonus a loan of  such loans are common practice within the industry used as bait to poach brokers from one firm to another the sums are in effect a leveraged bonus when the broker hits his agreedupon production number the loan is forgiventhis loan according to people familiar with the case would represent the first of mr dardens deceptions the indictment says that he misrepresented his production figures at merrill when he secured the bonus newsletter

email view all new york times newsletters see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime in many recruiting situations all a broker needs to do is show his suitor a piece of paper listing his client assets and annual commissions and because the firm is so eager to bring him on it will make the loan after a perfunctory background check that is exactly what mr darden did in late  when wachovia financial services the independent broker arm of wachovia securities came knockingmr dardens career at smith barney had not taken off although his father signed up as an investor mr darden was less successful in persuading other ups executives to follow suita smith barney executive testified that mr darden never managed more than  million in assets or produced more than  in commissions his numbers put him in the lowest tier of smith barneys brokersaccording to testimony by wachovia executives however mr darden submitted a printout from smith barney stating that he controlled more than  million in assets and generated commissions of close to  million a year figures that would have put him in the top percentile of the firms brokers based in new york on the basis of that sheet mr darden was hired in april  and given a  loanbut at wachovia as at smith barney mr darden made no immediate impact his father followed him as a client but that was about it according to court papers mr darden generated  in commissions from april to september  a far cry from the commission target of  million he was expected to meet in order to have his  loan forgiven advertisement continue reading the main story again mr dardens ups connections and ties with celebrities helped solve his problems in the summer of  michael leechin the founder of aic the canadian mutual fund company was looking to get into the highnetworth market in the united states with a specific focus on athletes and entertainers according to forbes magazine mr leechin is worth more than  billion making him one of the wealthiest africanamericans in north americarunning into mr darden in new york mr leechin who knew of his father embarked on a campaign to hire him he invited him to his companys headquarters in toronto flying him to lunch in his personal sikorsky helicopterwell aware of mr dardens passion for sports cars he took him for a spin in his bright red enzo ferrari a rare car that costs more than  million for those lucky enough to get a chance to buy one according to friends of mr dardenmr darden was in awe of it all according to his friendshe was also bowled over by mr leechins ragstoriches story and entrepreneurialism born poor in jamaica mr leechin emigrated to ontario where he worked as a bouncer before he began selling mutual funds in the s working out of a bmw that he could not afford by the mids he had bought aic and after that became one of canadas richest menthere is a term in the hiphop community that mr dardens friends say aptly describes the attraction the two men had for each other game recognizes game meaning that each man saw a little bit of himself in the otherduring this time mr darden formed his own independent company called black umbrella with the aim of investing in small enterprises including a minorityowned condom companyand mr darden did not undersell himself according to court papers he showed aic the same position sheet from smith barney that he had submitted to wachovia this time though the sheet showed his assets under management to be  million again according to court papers he promised to deliver clients like nelly mr sprewell mr oneal and others he also asked for a bigger signon loan   million  which aic wired to him on oct  mr darden began to spend copious amounts of money on oct  he closed on the expansive home in the wealthy community of glen cove according to his real estate lawyer he took out two separate mortgages for more than  million and put down  as a down payment two days later he wired  million to his father according to court papers advertisement continue reading the main story as he was throwing around money his debtors were gathering in november wachovia sent him a letter asking him to repay in full the  or face legal actionand at aic as at wachovia the clients whom mr darden had promised did not materialize nor did any executives from ups save for his father friends of mr darden say aic did not provide the necessary logistical support he needed to persuade his corporate clients to move their accounts to aicaics patience quickly wore thin in january  mr leechin asked mr darden why he had not brought in any accounts and mr darden explained that his assistant had lost the transfer papers court papers say in march with aic demanding results mr darden flew to toronto and promised to deliver  clients by the end of the monthaic declined to wait on march  mr leechin sent a letter to mr darden terminating him and demanding repayment of the  million court documents show that mr darden never shirked his debtors he just told them that he could not paystill his mounting legal problems did not put a crimp in his spendthrift ways in march his travels took him from los angeles to las vegas to fort lauderdale fla where he made a  down payment on a gallon saltwater aquarium  feet long and  feet high he also dropped  at an art gallery in new yorkthe aquarium was delivered in april and stocked with  worth of tropical fish and four black tip reef sharks each three feet long and costing  the sharks however made quick work of the fish it cost mr darden  a month to service the tank and feed the sharks their prescribed diet of salmon and flounder filetsfor a few months mr darden could enjoy the giant aquarium in his living room people who know him say that amid all the stresses it soothed him to be able to come home collapse on one of his white leather couches and take in the aquatic spectacle throughout it all he spoke to his mother and father twice a day these people sayin june  however when a judge attached his assets mr darden found it increasingly hard to maintain his lifestyle i will suffer extreme personal and financial hardship if this attachment is granted he said in an affidavitbut the court disagreed within months mr darden had to cut his expenses among other things he stopped paying the service that fed the fish and cleaned the tank when two of his sharks died in october mr darden made a frantic phone call to the service promising to pay them if they came to his house and removed the rotting sharks advertisement continue reading the main story they were lying there dead on the bottom and other fish were eating them said joseph caparatta the president of new york aquarium service who came in to
