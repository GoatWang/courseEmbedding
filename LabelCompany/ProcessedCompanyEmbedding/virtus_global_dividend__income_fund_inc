into returns the aim is to measure the manager’s skill fund loads or sales charges aren’t included in the calculation of returns either each fund’s return is measured against those of all funds in its lipper category that leads to a percentile ranking with  the highest and  the lowest which is then weighted by asset size relative to the fund family’s other assets in its general classification if a family’s biggest funds do well that boosts its overall ranking poor performance in a big fund can have a big effect on the ranking finally the score is multiplied by the weighting of its general
