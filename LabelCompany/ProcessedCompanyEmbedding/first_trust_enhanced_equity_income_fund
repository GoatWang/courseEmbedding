funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed products monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for

months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods past results

sizes and styles a portfolios ownership zone™ is derived by plotting each stock in the funds portfolio within the proprietary morningstar style box™ the shaded area represents the center  of the funds assets and it provides an intuitive visual representation of the area of the market in which the fund invests a centroid plot in the middle of the ownership zone represents the weighted average of all the funds holdings a fund that is concentrated will have a small ownership zone relative to the area of the style box and broadly diversified fund will have an ownership zone that stretches across many sizes and style over a period of time the shape and location of a funds ownership zone may vary the model for the fixedincome style box is based on the two pillars of fixedincome performance interestrate sensitivity and credit quality the three interest sensitivity groups are limited moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high medium and low these groupings display a portfolios effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the funds risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio the sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities while the distribution rate reflects the fund’s past dividends paid to

change in interest rates with respect to individual bonds for example a duration of  years indicates that the price of a bond will risefall by approximately  if rates in general fallrise by  typically bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes bond statistic average life in years expressed in years average life is time weighting the expected principal payments taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments in general it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity eg mortgages mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the funds portfolio bond statistic average yield to maturity a weighted average of all the funds bond holdings yield to maturities yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity based on its price and coupon assumes that coupon payments can be

total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses

the general condition of the relevant stock market or when political or economic events affecting the issuers or their industries occur the fund may write sell covered call options on all or a portion of the equity securities held in the funds portfolio the use of options may require the fund to sell portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment or may cause the fund to hold an equity security that it might otherwise sell use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses there is no guarantee that the issuers of the equity securities in which the fund invests will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will
