during a general decline in the textile industry after world war i at this time hathaway was run by seabury stanton whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the depression after the merger berkshire hathaway had  plants employing over  workers with over  million in revenue and was headquartered in new bedford however seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade accompanied by large layoffs in  warren buffett began buying stock in berkshire hathaway after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill eventually buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the companys financial situation was not going to improve in  stanton made an oral tender offer of  ⁄ per share for the

this lower undercutting offer made him angry instead of selling at the slightly lower price buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire stanton which he did however this put buffett in a situation where he was now majority owner of a textile business that was failing buffett initially maintained berkshires core business of textiles but by  he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments berkshire first ventured into the insurance business with the purchase of national indemnity company in the late s berkshire acquired an

received the tender offer in writing but the tender offer was for only  ⁄ buffett later admitted that this lower undercutting offer made him angry instead of selling at the slightly lower price buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire stanton which he did however this put buffett in a situation where he was now majority owner of a textile business that was failing buffett initially maintained berkshires core business of textiles but by  he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments berkshire first ventured into the insurance business with the purchase of national indemnity company in the late s berkshire acquired an equity stake in the government employees insurance company geico which forms the core of its insurance
