tactical income shares expense ratio  wbii currently sits at  million in assets under management presently ranking it as the sixth largest “multiasset” fund in that specific category behind etfs such as mdiv first trust multiasset diversified income expense ratio   million in aum aor ishares core growth allocation expense ratio   million in aum and several other ishares “allocation” funds in spite of seeing some mild outflows yeartodate  million out wbii debuted in late august of  so it still falls short of its three year anniversary once it hits the threeyear mark the fund will earn a morningstar ranking which has proven important in the past in the “actively managed” etf segment from what we have seen wbii is a “fund of funds” in the sense that it invests in other etfs within its investment methodology as we can see from current fund literature that top holdings in the fund include fixed income etfs from ishares vanguard powershares spdrs and pimco for example fund literature states that the investment mandate is “to provide investors with a wealthbuilding investment strategy that provides low volatility low correlation and an optimal blend of bear market capital preservation and bull market return the fund is active in an effort to reduce risk to protect capital and tactical in an attempt to find the best global investment opportunities wbii typically invests in incomeproducing debt and equity securities of foreign and domestic companies” presently we see the asset class breakdown inside of wbii as heavily favoring us fixed income securities with  of the portfolio residing there followed by lesser allocations to us listed equities  international fixed income securities  cash  and preferred stocks  disclaimer the content of this article is excerpted
