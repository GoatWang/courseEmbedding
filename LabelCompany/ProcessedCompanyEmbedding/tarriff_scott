thank you lisa and good morning everyone so this was a record quarter for eagle driven by bendeka and ryanodex with sequential and yearoveryear growth in revenue and profitability we continue to pursue the strategy we outlined at year end and the company is committed to successfully execute on that strategy i remain confident that this will be another transformative year for eagle with ongoing progress net revenue increased to  million which continues to be driven by the growth in bendeka our bendamustine hydrochloride injectable marketed by teva which reached a record  market share and of course ryanodex sales and we delivered another strong quarter of growth in net income with eps of  per diluted share while investing in our rd programs and scaling our commercial organization to support the launch of ryanodex for exertional heat stroke this year if approved and advancing multiple additional development programs while we are not providing formal guidance for  we believe that the fullyear analyst estimates are consistent with our expected performance that said we are increasing our spend on additional rd projects and product launch activities during the second quarter because of this investment q eps will be lower than current analyst consensus the second quarter will also be the last quarter during which there will be an overlap between our thirdparty sales force licensing agreement and the growth in our own sales force as the licensing expenses will be eliminated in subsequent quarters importantly our q spend should have a positive impact in return on our business beginning in q with our expected launch of ryanodex and continue for the remainder of  as part of our overall strategy and to maximize the value of our growing asset portfolio we are advancing the development of our ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication program and fulvestrant and adrian hepner our chief medical officer and the eagle team have made progress to prepare for the four clinical studies i mentioned on our q call fulvestrant ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxications the third indication for ryanodex the lead product we are developing in conjunction with amri and a potentially fourth product to build our pipeline and secure the future of the company we are now about  months through the year and eagle is achieving the milestones we laid out on our yearend call lets review those and why we believe eagle is poised for strong  on a sequential basis bendeka royalties were up  million over q we continue to see market share expansion for bendeka which grew to  as of the end of the first quarter and for which we now received a  royalty during the quarter we extended the patent protection of our bendamustine portfolio with a total of eight newly issued patents this brings the total number of issued patents to  of which  are orange book listed and we remain committed to protecting the longevity of the product we continue to make significant progress towards advancing our pipeline and launching ryanodex for exertional heat stroke if approved let me first update you on our ryanodex program during the first quarter we achieved a significant milestone the fda granted priority review for the nda we submitted for exertional heat stroke ehs is a significant unmet medical need many patients may have longterm neurological damage organ damage and technical difficulty we are preparing for the launch of this important indication for which there is no approved drug treatment currently available with anticipated pdufa date of july  of this year we continue to align resources and plan for product launch were building a  person sales team to support the launch of ehs if approved all of which will be in place by the end of this month this would be our first self launch product and the first of several labeled extensions were exploring for ryanodex were obviously pleased with the  million in q sales from our mh indication with the sales team of only  with the added internal sales strength and the anticipated second indication for ryanodex we expect our dantrolene sales to continue to grow in  we anticipate reaching several additional important achievements and milestones in  based on what we laid out at year end the clinical trial dosing for ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication indication which we broadened to include severe organ dysfunction and damage following our preind meeting with the fda will begin shortly we expect to start dosing our first subject next month currently we consider this a phase  study and were starting to recruit now for it but please note that this program may role into a pivotal phase  study program and we believe we can recruit all of the required patients over the next six months as everybody knows we start building our ryanodex acid with malignant hyperthermia which is doing quite well were hopeful that these potential exciting indications will be meaningful to patients and to the company we are also currently working on a few new indications for ryanodex in addition to those that we’ve previously disclosed the nature of these indications will provide us with additional near and midterm opportunities for which the market sizes are meaningful i would also note that we remain committed to further approvals and licensing agreements for ryanodex exus as you can see we expect to continue expanding the value of ryanodex by adding further indications and expanding our reach into new territories all of which we will discuss in greater detail as the year progresses our fulvestrant work continues fulvestrant is an exciting opportunity to improve patient care and could be a significant source of revenue for eagle were recruiting sites and expect to dose our first patients within the next couple of months we remain very excited about this opportunity fulvestrant could well be a  billion worldwide product by the time we come to market representing a very meaningful opportunity for us going forward likewise we see a potentially significant opportunity for our pemetrexed formulation and await the fdas decision in october of this year turning to eagle biologics we continue to evaluate opportunities in the space where we are developing innovative formulations of several significant biologics we believe that we have a strong platform from which to partner with ebiologic innovators and biosimilar companies to improve their existing pipelines into biobetters enabling better patient friendly delivery of biologics and potentially improving bioavailability we will keep you apprised of developments with eagle biologics throughout the course of the year as well id like to end my prepared remarks by reminding everyone that we are committed to unlocking the full value of our growing portfolio of assets for the benefit of our patients employees and shareholders were implementing a strategy and action plan that positions us for a successful product launch this year with ryanodex for ehs and a path forward for product introductions from our deep rd pipeline our strong financial position ensures that we have the resources necessary to execute our strategy and with that ill turn our call over to david riggs our cfo to update you on our first quarter results david david riggs thank you scott for the first quarter of  our revenue totaled  million compared with  million in the first quarter of  the revenue mix consisted of product sales royalty revenue and license and other income overall total net product sales reflecting all eagle products increased  million to  million during the quarter driven primarily by net sales of  million in ryanodex and  million in bendeka royalty income increased to  million compared with  million during the first quarter of  reflecting increased bendeka sales and our royalty rate of  during the first quarter of  compared to  in q of  when bendeka was first launched license and milestone income for the first quarter of  were approximately  million milestone achieved upon teva reaching  million in cumulative bendeka sales we feel confident in our ability to meet our top line goals for the year keeping in mind that our revenue in  will be largely impacted by tevas marketing activities for bendeka the launch  successful launch of ryanodex for ehs and new opportunities that may go over the course of the year on the expense front rd expenses for the first quarter of  were  million compared to  million in the first quarter of  the  million increase is primarily due to the increase in spending for the manufacture of batches  development batches for fulvestrant which in part we plan to use for clinical testing later this year we continue to expect our rd expense to be in the range of  million to  million this year largely driven by our planned clinical studies if we opt to run additional study during the year rd spend may increase sga was  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the prior year quarter sales and marketing expenses and personnel related expenses grew in accordance with our prelaunch activities for ryanodex or ehs and accounted for  million of the increase for the quarter for  we continue to expect sga to be in the range of  million to  million a  million to  million increase for the year we anticipate that a higher portion of our total operating expenses will be reflected during the second quarter of  as we complete our obligations under the  our agreement with spectrum pharmaceuticals that ends at the end of july prepare for the launch of ryanodex for ehs at the end of july if approved and begin clinical trials for both fulvestrant and ryanodex for meth and ecstasy intoxication we should see a more normalized level of spending in our operating expenses during the third and fourth quarters of the year earnings before taxes in the first quarter of  were  million net tax expense for the quarter was  million up  effective tax rate which brings us to q  net income of  million or  per basic and  per diluted share compared to net a net loss of  or  per basic and diluted share in q of  as part of our stock repurchase plan we purchased  million worth of our shares in the first quarter of  and have now repurchased  million or  shares since the third quarter of  we believe this reflects an effective use of our growing cash position and is in the best interest of shareholders we ended the first quarter of  with a  million in cash and cash equivalents an  million in net accounts receivable  million of which was due from teva this represents an increase of  million in cash and cash equivalents and net accounts receivable compared to december   company had no outstanding debt with that i’d like to thank you for your continued support and open the call for questions operator please go ahead and open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we will take our first question from david amsellem with piper jaffray please go ahead your line is open david amsellem thanks just a couple first on pemetrexed on that product my understanding is that you have yet to be or not been sued by lilly here so i wanted to get your thoughts on what to expect here going forward are you going to be in a position to launch shortly after approval if assuming that it is a timely approval and how should we think about what your strategy is there and what your thoughts are on the competitive dynamics there scott tarriff thanks david good to hear from you so pemetrexed as we mentioned it’s filed we have a pdufa date at the end of october and the best way to describe it is that we’re obviously doing everything we can to optimize the value of the asset we really cant comment past this at this time and its a fluid situation just keep in mind that it ebbs and flows and were doing everything possible to find the appropriate value in the product david amsellem okay and then just as a followup and this is on ryanodex and i may have missed this early since i joined the call a little late but can you talk about the study or the path forward in druginduced hyperthermia and can you just remind us when you think you’d be in a position or what’s the earliest timeline for when you think youd be in a position to file the snda in that indication scott tarriff yes thanks david yes ryanodex for amphetamine overdose specifically ecstasy and meth is really pretty exciting and so what we commented here this morning is that were getting ready to start dosing patients probably have the first patient dose next month already if all goes well the expectation is that we will have the study completely recruited in the next six months right so that’s before this year if all goes well it will either be a phase  study or a phase  study we will get back with the fda and we will followup on the timelines after that but what were trying to do is have all the patients recruited now this year and then file as quickly as we possibly can after that david amsellem so just to be clear as the fda communicated to you that a single study in that indication would be sufficient for filing scott tarriff yes at this point what transpired david is we had our preind meeting with fda obviously we met with them we brought into the view of what that clinical trial would look like and now we’ve decided to go and recruit those patients and now either via phase  or pivotal study we will start collecting the data we will meet with them again and they will have a better answer for you but we believe we have a very good handle on the situation and we expect to have the study completely enrolled in a very reasonable amount of time david amsellem okay thank you scott tarriff thank you very much operator we will take our next question from randall stanicky with rbc capital markets please go ahead randall stanicky great scott i just have a couple can you first comment on what the specific pluses and minuses are of potentially having a new partner selling bendeka if teva was to sell it to oncology business and maybe walk through the contractual protections in the event of a change of control that you have there and then i’ve a followup scott tarriff yes thanks randall so look teva is our partner for oncology for bendeka i dont know anything beyond that they are doing an outstanding job obviously sure we’re all very pleased with the fact that they reach  market share now and we can see the growth that weve had in our royalties at  level this year compared to last year and certainly last quarter all i can remind everyone is that bendeka is the largest product in that division and im sure if they do divest anyone who acquires it is going to be acquiring it largely for this wonderful asset that we’ve built so i’d imagine that anybody if anybody took over that division they would feel the same way about it id also remind everyone that there are certain diligence items if you will in the contract that would require any potential future owner to live up to those same obligations so we’re not very concerned  in fact we’re not concerned at all the product continues to do very well teva is putting significant amount of resource behind it and we have record  market share randall stanicky are those obligation related to selling and marketing spend or number of reps or a combination of both scott tarriff it is a dollar amount randall stanicky it is okay and then my followup here is can you just comment on the timeline as it currently stands on fulvestrant if thats changed from we’ve previously talked about an april  nda filing time line and obviously priority review is important and specifically scott how many months is enough in terms of getting out ahead of generics and feeling like you can maximize that market opportunity scott tarriff yes so look randall good question on fulvestrant everything is on target were doing everything we can to get the product to the market in the timeframe that weve outlined its interesting question its obviously a growing product its  we think it could be a billion dollar product worldwide by the time you get to  and lets remind everyone what weve done to the product right the current product has two very viscous castor oil based  ml injections that need to be injected over  to  minutes painful and with a warning attached to the product about  associated with the number of sticks and the formulation and here we come along hopefully if we’re successful and we cut the number of injections from  to  we reduced the volume from  ml to  ml so we’ve reduced the volume in half our im injection should be no different amount of pain than a typical im drug and if were correct then we’re able to take the warning label out and receive a unique jcode we really would have by far the better product in a very large market better for patients and for the people that actually have to deliver the drug in colleges and oncology nurses and so even if the period of time if we launched after generics or we launched before generics and generics eventually came to the market i think based on all of that that i just described this product should do extremely well regardless in a very significant market and so obviously were trying everything we can to get the product to the market prior to generics coming to the market but even if we wound up being late then we still think we have a very wonderful opportunity ahead of us randall stanicky do you think given the safety differentiation and potential lack of black box do you think theres clinical support for astra assuming you are to partner with astra pulling the older version and promoting your improved version scott tarriff yes there is no black box and its really impossible to predict randall i think the point is that if we were successful with the plan weve outlined we certainly would have by far the better product on the market and you can see lets use bendeka as an example right the products coexist on the marketplace but bendeka is just such a better product than the old treanda we’ve  share now and so i think that youll see a similar type of marketplace unfolding if we brought fulvestrant to the market with or without a partner and so if you continue to innovate and bring out the better products i think the market just takes care of itself and all the physicians that weve spoken to about the product and the research that weve done we feel quite confident that people would far prefer to dispense the product that weve outlined than the current product that’s on the market randall stanicky okay that’s great thanks scott scott tarriff thank you operator operator instructions we will go next to tim lugo with william blair please go ahead tim lugo thanks for the question just a followup on fulvestrant can you discuss the clinical program again im not sure if i came on a little late may be you discussed that earlier how many patients what’s the duration and how long you’re going to be following outcomes to come up with enough safety events that would differentiate label scott tarriff yes thank you tim so as we stated those patients are going to start to be recruited very soon and i don’t think its going to take a unusual amount of time to get the product completely recruited i would think its in our plan from the time we start recruiting to the time we go through the  months of stability for the product we should be able to recruit all of our patients at that point theres probably about a day followup after the last patient is recruited and i don’t know probably   patients is what were thinking at this point all very achievable in the timeframe that we’ve laid out tim lugo okay great and for the additional candidates amri and the other can development when do you think you’re going to disclose those scott tarriff you know i think towards the end of the year as the year rolls along tim we will have more product information today on the call i just spoke briefly about additional indications of ryanodex that we havent discussed yet that could be extremely meaningful to us and so as the year goes by and as we have the discussions with the fda and as we have our patent situations in place as we always do we will speak a little bit more to you tim lugo okay and for the exertional heat stroke indication you’re going  your pdufa date is midq will we have to wait for q to see a ramping in ryanodex revenue scott tarriff well we will have it launched on the day of the approval and we will start the program the  reps will be all be on board this month they will be out promoting both mh and then upon approval ehs and well see those sales shortly after launch and we will report back obviously as soon as we’re able to tim lugo okay i guess for malignant hyperthermia what do you think the percentage is the penetration now scott tarriff what we have well over a  hospitals now somewhere between a  i think and  or so and if you think there are  hospitals right theres our market share and that’s with about right a dozen people moving up to  now and the intent would be that with the additional salespeople the mh indication should continue to grow and then assuming the ehs approval on time in july we think were positioned well with  people to hit the gates quickly expanding the number of vials that  or  hospitals stock and then continuing to have new hospital stock to product in both the operating room and the emergency room tim lugo okay and maybe a question for david it looks like accounts receivable was up a bit especially over your cash levels can you just talk about cash collections and how we should expect that the trend in the next couple of quarters david riggs sure tim well i think what i want to do is assure you that none of those receivables are late we’ve been getting remittances mainly from teva our largest ar source on a timely regular basis and yes they’re higher but we did earn a  million milestone which is in there and there was some inventory replenishment that went into that bucket along with just normal royalty revenue so not to worry its a higher balance but it should work itself down in q tim lugo okay great and actually before i hop off sorry for all the questions the undisclosed candidate is that part of the reserve folks down in boston scott tarriff no no tim lugo okay all right well thanks a lot scott tarriff thank you tim operator and we will take our next question as a followup from randall stanicky please go ahead randall stanicky hey scott thanks just two quick followups first on pemetrexed im not sure how much you’re able to comment but as we get closer to pdufa if we dont see a settlement with lilly what legal or at risk launch options do you have given that you havent been sued but that threat certainly could be lingering and then i just wanted to clarify on guidance when you mentioned that your  that your expected performance is consistent with the analysts  forecast are you talking about both revenue and eps thanks scott tarriff yes thanks randall to the alimta question we really cant comment any further theres just so much activity that’s going to take place over the rest of the year on alimta its just going to  as i keep saying the ebb and flowing if we have anything tangible that we can tell you we will we will just watch the situation just know that we are doing everything we can to find the appropriate value on that asset and in terms of guidance when we made that statement were thinking mostly about the eps number but you can see from q our top line continues to do rather well we had a very good first quarter and  months for the year were very pleased with the way the business is running from a commercial standpoint david pernock is here in the room with me right now and hes just been doing an outstanding job of preparing for the launch and bringing the sales forward on the product so we do have in the market so we just feel good about  all the way around as we move forward randall stanicky great thanks again operator it appears we have no further questions at this time i will return the floor to scott tarriff for any additional or closing remarks scott tarriff yes thank you operator thank you everybody for being on the call i know its a bust day today really appreciate and hope to speak to everybody again shortly with more information thank you

lisa and good morning everyone in  we significantly enhanced eagle’s longterm value it was a transformative year and i’m pleased to report that we continue to see significant momentum in our business our revenue grew  to  million and fully diluted eps grew to  per share largely due to our readytodilute bendamustine product bendeka launched in january of  with our commercial partner teva bendeka now commands a  share of the bendamustine market exceeding our joint goal of  we are pleased with teva’s ability to rapidly convert the market with bendeka and expect it will continue and which will contribute significantly to our financial performance for many years to come a driver of growth in  earlier in the year teva provided bendeka guidance of  million to  million for  which did not include an increase in products while their fourth quarter results were at the low end of the range from what we see so far this year we are comfortable with their range and realize that we are only eight weeks into the quarter but as of today bendeka net sales during these first eight weeks are running ahead of the first eight weeks of last quarter and don’t forget we have a full quarter of a  royalty compared to  last quarter in q of last year we received a  million milestone payment for the jcode and  million in royalty this quarter we have now qualified for a  million sales bonus triggered by cumulative bendeka sales reaching  million since its launch todate we have earned a total of  million in milestones related to bendeka there is significant cash flowing to eagle from this relationship and we’ll shortly discuss how we’ve elected to put our growing cash position to work while we continue to focus on investing in our future with the cms decision to issue unique jcode which went into effect in january of this year outpatient facilities and physicians that administer bendeka now have reimbursement coding clarity which we believe will make it easier for patients to access the product and support further growth in market share this combined with  issued or allowed patents protecting our bendeka portfolio todate  of which have been issued  of which are orange book listed and the successful outcome to a legal challenge to  of the  we believe the hurdle for any anda challenger is high and as we continue to file additional patents the patent protections for the bendeka family of products will continue to strengthen therefore we expect a long life cycle for bendeka supported by its multiple benefits to patients and providers and protected by a growing patent portfolio extending from  through  we also made significant progress this past year to advance our pipeline our most significant nearterm opportunity is in expanding the ryanodex label to include indications for the treatment of exertional heat stroke and ecstasy and metamfetamine intoxication as approved today ryanodex for malignant hyperthermia is a solid component of our portfolio our sales force of only about  people continues to increase ryanodex’s share of the dantrolene market substantially in  sales increased  to  million compared to  physicians understand this benefit in treating malignant hyperthermia which we believe will gain adoption of future ryanodex indications if approved we are confident in the growth of the molecule especially since we will be quadrupling our sales force from  reps to approximately  reps in january of this year we completed the nda submission for ryanodex for ehs and we requested priority review for this severe and debilitating condition that can cause longterm neurological impairment and organ damage for which there is no approved drug treatment currently available if grated as anticipated the pdufa date for a decision on the nda would be july of  later this year if ryanodex is approved for the treatment of ehs we could be the first to market with a potentially transformational therapy for the treatment of ehs in emergency settings that ameliorate brain damage and organ impairment david pernock will address our commercialization plans in more detail shortly remember we believe ehs is significantly underreported and there may be approximately  cases of ehs annually in the united states beyond ehs we also made progress exploring the potential ryanodex to treat ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication clinical studies are currently underway at the nih in december we had a positive preind meeting with the fda during which the fda suggested broadening the indication to evaluate severe organ dysfunction and damage planning and execution of a pilot clinical study is underway we anticipate beginning a pilot study as soon as possible followed by a pivotal study starting in q of this year both opportunities address debilitating conditions in sizable populations for who no drug treatment options are available today we are pleased that we were able to reduce our royalty obligations for ryanodex from  all the way down to  this will enhance our future earnings on the product in  we also acted to identify longerterm opportunities to replicate our successful product development and commercialization strategy we are working on an innovative formulation of fulvestrant and are very proud of the work we are doing here this is eagle’s first product completely developed inhouse showcasing our formulation and clinical knowhow the currently marketed formulation requires two large im injections to deliver the monthly recommended dose it contains castor oil and a warning has been added to the label concerning painful injections sciatica neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy the injections can last  to  minutes each our unique formulation contains no castor oil and only requires one monthly injection allowing for alternating the injection site every month therefore our belief is that we can eliminate the current warning in the label by conducting the appropriate clinical trial as a result of these improvements we hope to achieve the unique jcode just like we did with bendeka we filed an nda for our readytouse pemetrexed in formulation in december which was just accepted for filing it has a pdufa target date of october  of this year importantly we also established a foothold in the biologics space with our acquisition of arsia therapeutics renamed now eagle biologics our plan to partner with key biologic innovators and biosimilar companies to improve their existing pipelines into biobetters you will hear more about biologic strategy over the course of the year in addition to building our product portfolio we are focused on optimizing our strong financial position we acted to accelerate spend in rd and sga during the fourth quarter where it made sense so that we would be better positioned for  and  at the end of  cash and cash equivalents were  million accounts receivable were  million we remain debt free and we repurchased approximately  million of eagle stock and since commencing the program authorized in july of  eagle has purchased more than  shares totaling approximately  million or over  of our stock to answer the question of what we are doing with our cash we are accelerating our rd where possible and buying back our stock if our rd continues to perform as it has then our stock buyback will prove to be even more positive we plan to remain focused on shareholder return and believe we have been very good stewards of our cash our average purchase price is slightly more than  per share and we are quite pleased with our investments i’d like to also mention that as eagle builds an attractive portfolio of injectable assets that address a large market opportunity we continue to strengthen our management team i’m very pleased that david pernock a longtime business partner and friend and industry leader with exceptional commercial track record of bringing blockbuster drugs to the market has transitioned from our board of directors to lead our commercial team as president and chief commercial officer david has hired team members with extensive industry experience to assist in the launch of eagle products with mike moran and sherry korczynski reporting to david along with the extended team i am very confident that eagle will be well positioned to commercialize our products beginning with ryanodex for exertional heat stroke if approved as we move through the rest of the call you’ll hear from david riggs our cfo about our performance last quarter and during the year including the accelerated and nonrecurring expenses in q and expense guidance for  david pernock will then discuss the upcoming ehs launch and adrian hepner will discuss our clinical activities before i turn the call over to them let me leave you with a few thoughts about this year we believe  will be another transformative year for the company we expect to have another strong quarter here in q bendeka royalties are running ahead of q and we have earned a  million sales milestone this quarter we expect to have a person sales team to support ehs if approved and other products as they become market ready while our rd focus in  was on formulation development we’re now shifting our rd efforts to a clinical focus our inhouse formulation team will continue to deliver results with the development of pemetrexed and fulvestrant adrian’s team is preparing to run up to four clinical studies this year as we continue to build our pipelines and secure our future this includes fulvestrant the ecstasy and met intoxication as a third indication for ryanodex the lead product that we are developing in conjunction with amri and potentially a fourth study that you’ll learn about as the year progresses with that i’d like to turn the call over to david riggs our cfo to update you on our fourth quarter and full year financial results david david riggs thank you scott i’d like to start by pointing out that after we received the great news on the jcode for bendeka we were in the  million milestone we decided to accelerate spending in both rd projects and sales and marketing activities this spending amounted to approximately  million for the quarter and brought total operating expenses for the year up to our previously given expense guidance of  million to  million now i’ll go into the detail for the fourth quarter of  our revenue totaled  million compared with  million in the fourth quarter of  the revenue mix consisted of product sales royalty revenue and license and other income overall total product sales reflecting all eagle products increased  million to  million during the quarter driven by net sales of  million in ryanodex  million in bendeka and  million in docetaxel royalty income increased to  million compared to  in q  due to the launch of bendeka license and other income during the fourth quarter of  increased to  million compared to  million in  again due to bendeka we received a  million milestone payment from teva in q of  related to the new jcode and  million in q of  related to receiving the approval for bendeka from fda for the year total revenue increased  to  million consisting of  million in product sales  million in royalty revenue and  million in license and other fees on the expense front rd expenses for the fourth quarter of  were  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  the  million increase is due primarily to the increase in spending on fulvestrant and other accelerated and nonrecurring expenses keep in mind historically our average rd expense excluding the employee expenses during the first three quarters of  was approximately  million a quarter approximately  million of this  million in spending during the fourth quarter was related to accelerated and onetime expenses to advance our programs with  million in other rd expenses during the quarter this puts us in line with our average quarterly rd spend in the fourth quarter we elected to accelerate rd spending on fulvestrant a molecule we believe has significant value recording  million in development spending as a result we now have much of the development costs out of the way our fulvestrant spending in  will largely be related to running the clinical study registration batches associated with the product will be reflected however in our q numbers in q we recorded  million of nonrecurring filing fee expenses related to pemetrexed we spent  million in the fourth quarter to accelerate a project with amri moving the lead product forward and lastly we recorded a onetime  million raw material writeoff from one of our development projects for the year rd expense was  million compared with  million in  looking ahead to  we expect our yearly rd spending to be essentially flat the maturity of our rd spend will shift from formulation development to clinical expense as we move the company to a more robust and clinically focused commercial organization we may run as many as four clinical trials this year as scott mentioned the nature of rd expense in  will be substantially different from that – the  million was spent in  we nevertheless plan to be in the range of  million to  million in  this includes  million to  million earmarked for our biologics division if we opt to run additional clinical studies during the year rd spending may increase that will become clear as the year progresses back to our  expenses sga was  million in the fourth quarter of  compared to  million in the prior year’s quarter ga remained essentially flat for the quarter sales and marketing expenses and personnelrelated expenses accounted for the bulk of the  million increase and grew largely in accordance with our prelaunch activities for ryanodex for ehs here again we are able to utilize our growing cash position to accelerate  million in spending from ryanodex for ehs marketing activities for the year sga expenses increased to  million due to overall expansion of the business for  we expect sga to be in the range of  million to  million a  million to  million increase in  as we’ve mentioned before we don’t expect to renew the spectrum contract when it expires in july the money we save will not be a complete offset but will be a substantial one against the cost of building our own sales force as we prepare for the launch of ryanodex for ehs we expect that even with launch expenses our ryanodex franchise will have a positive pl effect in  as you saw in our fourth quarter results sales of ryanodex for malignant hyperthermia were  million we think this market still has room to grow particularly as we expand our sales force from  to  people we anticipating stocking for mh and ehs in  even with added expense for our internal sales force we expect ryanodex to have a positive pl effect and we are setting ourselves up for a very good  i’d like to point out that included in operating expenses in  is approximately  million related to stockbased compensation expense that’s a  increase over the same period in  we estimate that stockbased compensation expense will increase to approximately  million in  next let’s talk about our changing tax landscape which affected both fourth quarter and full year  for the full year the company recorded a net tax benefit of  million included in this amount is a reversal of our valuation allowance which has been carried against the company’s net deferred asset consisting primarily of net operating losses based on our current profitability expected in future profits we believe it is likely that these tax numbers will be utilized as i have previously said the company expects to be a taxpayer going forward as a us company we expect to record tax rates at statutory rates earnings before taxes in the fourth quarter of  were  million the net tax benefit for the quarter was  million which brings us to q  net income of  million or  per basic and  per diluted share compared to net income of  million or  per basic and  per diluted share in q of  earnings before taxes for the year was   million and the net tax benefit for the year was  million this brings us to net income of  million or  per basic and  per diluted share compared with net income of  million or  per basic and  per diluted share in  on august   the board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to  million as scott has said previously i’ll add a little bit to this we repurchased  million during the fourth quarter of  and a total of  million throughout the end of  we’ve now repurchased approximately  million or over  shares of stock we believe this reflects an effective use of our growing cash position and it is in the best interest of shareholders we ended  with  million in cash and cash equivalents  million in receivables with approximately  million due from teva and don’t forget we have a  million milestone payment due from teva related to the bendeka sales milestone thank you with that i’ll turn it over to david pernock david pernock thank you david i’m very pleased to be on the call and my role in eagle as president and chief commercial officer as an eagle board member i became deeply involved in the company’s pipeline and prospects which made a decision to take this position straightforward i am confident in eagle’s future and glad to be onboard in this capacity to ensure a successful commercial launch for our next product ryanodex we are working diligently to prepare for our first selflaunch product which if approved will be first in class and the only drug in the market for treatment of exertional heat stroke there is a high clinical need in the market we believe that if approved by the fda our ryanodex formulation for exertional heat stroke will feel that need ineffective treatment can lead to severe neurological complications and even death as many as  of patients with exertional heat stroke experience longterm neurological damage with ryanodex once approved we believe practitioners will be able to treat heat stroke patients from the inside out we know that the brain heats up faster than the body and is more likely to have sustaining damage from exertional heat stroke elevated temperature can lead to calcium dysregulation that lead to cell damage and cell death in the brain we believe our formulation by modulating the ryanodine receptors in the brain which are intracellular calcium release channels may contribute to restoring calcium homeostasis arresting the excitotoxicity cascade and ameliorating brain damage we know that external cooling methods alone are not sufficient to shutoff the receptors our goal is to help protect patients from a longterm impact of exertional heat stroke by including ryanodex with the current standard of care to accomplish this we plan to increase our internal sales force to  we’ll be targeting the top  hospitals and the military we also plan to work with large major influencers and stakeholders to change treatment guidelines and protocols medical education will play a significant portion of what we do to inform the market cooling while important is clearly not enough more must be done we will be launching a public relations campaign to raise awareness that a drug option is available to treat exertional heat stroke let me just remind you that we submitted the product to the fda in january we’re awaiting fda approval and are hopeful for a decision in this july i am proud to highlight that dr julian bailes is a driving force who shed light on the issue of concussion in the nfl is now working with eagle in an advisory role his efforts formed the basis of the movie concussion which described a devastating impact of brain injury suffered by football players many of those afflicted by ehs are young athletes in the prime of their lives and as i said a moment ago those that survive ehs attacks often have brain damage dr bailes is passionate about the negative impact of ehs on the brain and we are fortunate that he will serve as a consultant at eagle as we work to raise public awareness of this condition this is an important product for eagle with the potential to be a significant addition to our portfolio as david riggs mentioned with the spectrum sales force deal ending here we expect our direct sales expense as we build our team to be substantially offset by that savings with additional expenses largely attributed to our direct marketing efforts this is an important launch for eagle demonstrating our ability to commercialize products without partnering and we also plan to allocate the necessary resources to ensure its success we believe that building our own internal commercial team of approximately  builds strength in the marketplace and open new opportunities for the future to sum it up there’s a clear unmet medical need with life threatening consequences we believe we have the right product candidate to fit that need we are building the organization for a successful launch in anticipation of approval we believe ryanodex has the potential to treat mh ehs and other hyperthermic conditions including those induced by drugs such as ecstasy and methamphetamines but more importantly our ryanodex portfolio will be profitable this year i look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year with that i’ll turn the call over to adrian who will discuss some additional pipeline opportunities adrian hepner thank you david as scott and david mentioned we are also exploring the potential for ryanodex in treatment hyperthermia induced by ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication which may lead to neurological complications and brain injury this will be a very important selfindication for ryanodex as over  emergency room visits annually are related to ecstasy and meth use just in the united states we are working jointly with the national institute on drug abuse part of the national institutes of health in our effort to address this growing public health problem nida began a pivotal animal study during the summer of  initial data shows that animals with ecstasyinduced hyperthermia treated with ryanodex had a greater decrease in brain temperature compared to animals treated with the control only we are very encouraged with the results and filed a prenda meeting with the fda in december in the meeting the fda suggested expanding the indication to evaluating severe organ dysfunction and damage such as renal and liver impairment in patients with mdma and methamphetamine intoxication which we plan to do it’s important to keep in mind that while the ryanodine receptors play a major role in the brain these receptors are also widely found throughout the human body we do not believe a full clinical trial will be required to support the efficacy of ryanodex for this indication at this time we are planning a pilot clinical study to maximize the strength and quality of our pivotal trial we anticipate that a single robust control and well powered clinical trial may be sufficient for filing the nda a pilot study will start as soon as possible with a pivotal study anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of this year as scott and david noted we have also advanced our trial to develop an innovative formulation for fulvestrant for use by breast cancer patients the currently marketed formulation requires two large intramuscular injections to deliver the monthly recommended dose it contains castor oil and a warning has been added to the label concerning painful injections sciatica neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy the injections can last  to  minutes each our unique formulation contains no castor oil and only requires one monthly injection allowing for isolated injection sites every month therefore our belief is that we can eliminate the current warning in the label by conducting the appropriate clinical trial our innovative formulation and simplified dose regimen may offer competitive improvements for the market to convert and this product could be an important addition to the longterm value of our business these are just two of the products we are balancing we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year with that i will turn the call back to scott scott tarriff thanks adrian in my opening remarks i indicate that  was an important year for eagle market share grew and bendeka now holds a  share of the bendamustine market we achieved major milestones and just met another surpassing  million in cumulative bendeka sales since launch we strengthened our ip with a total now of  issued or allowed patents we accelerated development of fulvestrant we submitted an nda for ryanodex for exertional heat stroke and initiated studies with the nih for ecstasy and meth intoxication we submitted an nda for pemetrexed which has been accepted for filing by the fda we entered into the most attractive drug market in the world with the formation of eagle biologics and we managed our money and maximized shareholder return by accelerating to expand in q and repurchasing our stock as we look at the year ahead in  we are poised to be even more significant than in  bendeka will continue to be a solid contributor to our earnings with an additional  million in milestone payments from teva reflecting in our performance this year we anticipate an fda decision on two nda submissions ryanodex for ehs which could be as early as july and pemetrexed with a pdufa date of october  of this year we will be scaling our commercial organization to prepare for its first selflaunched commercial product if approved we will pursue opportunities to apply the eagle model to the growing field of biologics by improving delivery and partnering with an innovator or with those developing biosimilars and importantly we have additional pipeline opportunities that we will discuss as the year progress i am very proud of the work our team has accomplished in creating products that improve people’s lives and deliver value to our shareholders i’m very more excited about the additional value in our pipeline that we plan to unlock in the coming months thank you for your support and for joining us this morning operator please go ahead and open the line for questions thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from the line of david amsellem with piper jaffray please go ahead david amsellem so a few questions here first on ryanodex on the clinical program in druginduced hyperthermia can you provide and maybe it’s too early to do this but can you provide details on what the design of a controlled pivotal trial will look like and then secondly on pemetrexed is it your expectation that you’re going to get sued by lilly and maybe walk us through how you’re thinking about that from a legal perspective and then lastly i know we asked these questions a lot but this is on the big bag i haven’t asked it in a while but any plans there regarding the big bag on bendamustine and is that something that may be in the cards down the road thanks scott tarriff hi david thank you very much let me take your questions if you don’t mind in reverse order look big bag we’re thrilled with how it’s doing  share of this market exceeds our expectations we started out slow we were hoping for  then we moved the target up to  and now we’re at  and quite frankly we think it’s going to continue to grow they’re doing everything that we asked for great partners the product is building well the feedback that we’re getting from patients and physicians has been wonderful as well and i don’t think there’s any need in the short term to do anything with the big bag i think where it plays a potential role and we’ll just have to see how we feel about it is ultimately when generics come to the market if we want to use the big bag to keep that  of the share that we can if we’re going to lose but for heaven’s sakes we have all the way until the end of  to worry about that so short answer nothing imminent about big bag as it relates to pemetrexed you’ve been involved we’ve all been involved in these things before you heard we described it previously when you’re trying to get to the market it’s interesting isn’t it how our marketplace has evolved over time we just have a better product it’s going to be a rollercoaster of a ride to figure out how we get the product to the market once it’s approved we feel really strongly about moving through the review cycle with fda over the next  months and expect to have a positive action at the end of october we really can’t comment on litigation on what may happen other than there’s just going to be a lot of activity between now and the time that we ultimately bring the product to the market lastly let me ask adrian if he can comment on the ryanodex clinical design size of the dih program adrian hepner thank you scott we are working with the fda and with clinicians experts in this field to decide the best study and as we said during the call we are planning to run a pilot study first to really make our pivotal trial as strong as conclusive as possible with that being said the study will be utilized in the current standard of care which will be standardized across every single clinical site involved in the study all patients will receive that as they should of course and the ryanodex will be added in a randomized manner to the patients that belong to that treatment group with that being said there are multiple factors and multiple measurements and several data we can use to really assess all the damage and of course the brain disorders associated with that it’s well known that druginduced hyperthermia especially associated to indiscernible as these two that we are planning to study produce severe kidney damage muscle damage liver damage and devastating population disorders of course on top of these issues come a confusion and many other neurological disorders so all these are going to be taken into account in a holistic manner to assess how a patient progresses from the moment he’s admitted into the study throughout the conclusion of the study scott tarriff thank you adrian david i should add one more point that i neglected in your big bag question also keep in mind that we believe that in  over  bendeka royalty will grow pretty significantly for us it’s a pretty good growth driver and when you think about it we now going into the year with this  market share right from the beginning of the year and so another reason not to worry about big bag into  david amsellem thank you operator thank you we’ll go next to the line of randall stanicky from rbc capital markets please go ahead randall stanicky great thanks scott on ryanodex for exertional heat stroke for investors who are looking at this and looking at the upcoming launch which is going to be new and unique unmet need it’s obviously a new category can you just walk through the selling process of the  reps who are they going to be selling to are these pt committees how should we think about the uptake here in order to set expectations appropriately and penetration and how quickly can that happen scott tarriff randall i’m going to turn that over to dave pernock let me remind you just upfront we have basically three categories we have the military we have the hospitals and we have the ambulances all playing a part in this but i think this is best for david to go and respond to david pernock thank you scott randall to address your question our primary focus is going to be on emergency rooms and the military for the most part during the first core parts of the launch a couple of factors to keep in mind is that even military is potentially a very large purchaser of our product as well because exertional heat stroke is one of the leading causes of death and longterm injury in military outside of – what happens on battlefield so we work the government exclusively we’re in the process of hiring a really high talented team there and we have a good plan going forward in terms of the emergency room we’re working with emergency medicine physicians often times our sports medicine physicians are involved in helping influence guidelines with emergency room medicine physicians and also neurology sometimes has a key role too therefore it’s important for us to bring dr bailes onboard importantly our reps will be calling on the top  hospitals focusing on topdown approach and we think we have a compelling need where fortunately that we already are formulary in a considerable amount of hospitals with mh which we think helps ease the formulary process for us we’re just adding another indication it’s not so easy compared to getting a new product approved through formulary as far as formulary process for those hospitals over the platform formulary process the way i look at it from all the experience i’ve had in launching many many products in the industry is that we have a very unique opportunity here and that we have no product to displace no company to fight against on the formulary battles because there isn’t anything for exertional heat stroke we’ll be the first and only product ever approved in the world for exertional heat stroke and there’s a high unmet medical need there not only is there a huge emotional component being able to help these unfortunate patients that have a heat stroke that are otherwise healthy we have a very unique selling proposition here and we have very very strong clinical data and i think that’s testament to the fact that we hope to get approval by the end of july so we’ll be ready to go we’ll be working on educational programs we’ll have programs to help build awareness of the disease state with a longterm impact of the disease state prior launch we’ll be having a lot of public relations efforts so dr bailes will be available to the media upon launch and the brand’s spokesperson and we will be able to cover  hospitals i think very efficiently and very effectively with the sales force in place randall stanicky thank you david on the assumption that you’re approved in july how do we think about contribution or ramp obviously i would assume that a military sale that could come early given the july timeframe but in terms of the ramp in terms of sales to hospitals and other groups is this going to be an educational process such that we should from an expectations perspective step back and say well there’s going to be a little bit of a selling process here and think about that as a  ramp or can you get out there quick and start penetrating earlier scott tarriff randall that’s really a very good question i’m going to turn that over to david again but before let me just remind you that what we’ve said today we almost had  million right  million of ryanodex sales in q and it’s growing nicely and so we’re still growing the mh market very very well we’re going from the  reps to the  reps so we just feel good about the ongoing growth of the product we do believe it’s a very large product out over several years as i’ve said before that’s the disconnect that we see and that’s the primary motivation that we’ve had since august to buy back our stock as it relates to the second half of this year and the first six months of launch what we’ve committed to so far is remarking that we expect that the pl for ryanodex will be positive this year with this added expense that we have in the launch year and if we do a really really good job and we have a nice profitable franchise in  that should set us up for really – what we think is a really very positive    beyond with this product and then you’ll layer on the new indications beyond this and so that’s the way we’re thinking about it david other comments david pernock i agree they add on to what scott said randall keep in mind a couple of things this is a transformational first of class product we’re going to get a lot of attention very quickly from emergency room physicians in particular and then there’s going to be a strong push on their half as advocates and as other companies have with our very talented sales organization to get the product out and get the products on formulary which means that we’re likely to get a lot of stocking let’s not forget that the typical dose is going to be  milligrams per kilogram and if every hospital stocks six to eight vials that’s a big number so we think people want to get ready they want to get ready for usage in  but we’ll benefit from a lot of stocking we also think that the stocking of ehs will help to even accelerate the stocking for mh because hospitals – once the product is viewed as an umbrella product for the treatment of all hyperthermia conditions hospitals want to train their staffs on how to use one product for all hyperthermia conditions including mh and ehs together so we think one indication helps strengthen the other that’s sort of the strength and the beauty of having wide portfolio products too and our sales organization is particularly indiscernible and skilled at hospital formulary processes most of the people we’re hiring are from hospital sales background for major companies and they know how to get to the formulary process and again this is an atypical situation because we’re not trying to knock another competitor off so we’re not – company a is not fighting company b it’s eagle and eagle alone and the only treatment out there is use some water so all we have to do is get hospitals to agree to use in conjunction with water we have very good safety profile with ryanodex too so we think that this will be much easier than other additional pharmaceutical launches so we’re very excited about it and we’re going to make it happen randall stanicky helpful color thanks guys scott tarriff thank you randall operator thank you we’ll go next to the line of irina koffler from mizuho securities please go ahead unidentified analyst hi this is andrew geller ph on for irina thanks for taking my questions so thinking about ehs reimbursement if a patient is treated by an emt in an ambulance if they’re brought to the hospital is there an existing pay and pathway in either setting or will eagle need to petition for a special payment michael moran very good question as far as reimbursement we’ve obviously studied this issue very thoroughly and we’re very happy with the results we find upon extensive research first of all our initial targets are largely going to be emergency rooms and physicians and ambulances will be somewhat of a partner for those ambulance services that are affiliated with the hospital but was in vertical integration and some of the very large ambulance companies we would be very successful with this product getting established with the emergency room physicians first military equally and then basically in the following year on totally ambulances we just want to say that’s twofold one is that for reimbursement point of view when a product is administered in the emergency room or in any hospital setting we’re very confident we’ll have no issues with reimbursement and likewise in military if the product is administered first in an ambulance and they’re not affiliated with the hospital you’re going to need different coding for that so we’ll be working on that in  as we apply through the process we’ll hopefully have those in place sometime before  season once we have the appropriate reimbursement code setup which takes some time to get then that opens up the opportunity to go to ambulance services we also believe that again since the treatment of heat stroke hasn’t changed since the roman empire that there’s need for a pharmacological intervention and so we think that we will be able to hopefully positively influence key stakeholders to influence guidelines to suggest that the simple thing to do and a most awful thing to do on behalf of patients is to add ranitidine ph to the standard of care so with guidelines in place reimbursement codes in place we think that operation in administration of ryanodex will be much easier to do a little bit down the road but at the meantime focus on hospitals and military there’s plenty of money to be made there and plenty of lives to be saved unidentified analyst all right thank you very much operator we’ll go next to the line of tim lugo from william blair please go ahead tim lugo thanks for the questions and thanks for all the ryanodex color i guess one more will the military be buying ahead of the summer it seems like their buying patterns would perceive the formal indication by the fda and maybe can you talk about the fourth study which may be initiated later is that – i might have missed this but is that a ryanodex indication and if so is that an acute or more of a chronic condition and also is that included in the rd guidance david pernock i’ll take the first part so basically just taking about the military obviously we can’t promote to military until we have product approval so we don’t expect any sales or any orders prior to getting our drug approved and then largely – when we speak of the military what i’d like to point out is there is – military has all the extended arms and tentacles in military for example national guard coast guard all these types of opportunities that emerge so we’ll be working at the appropriate times with the four forces in the military we’ll be working with every aspect of military agencies and groups to protect every possible person in services as far as the heat stroke just as an example national guard often times gets a call to – takes a flight for response and things of that nature and obviously that’s a very ripe opportunity for exertional heat stroke so we’re working with the appropriate agencies at the right point in time to encourage them to stockpile or to across the indiscernible product for them so if  national guards have been called to wyoming in the middle of summer flight for response we’ll be able to supply ryanodex whenever they need it so all these are different aspects that we’ve clearly brought through and we’ll be implementing as best we can but we’re bound by the same fda regulations with talking to military as well as civilian population so we’ll abide by all those guidelines scott tarriff tim in the conversations that we’ve had our objective here at eagle is to make sure that every military personnel around the globe has access to ryanodex if they need it and that is our first and foremost goal of the discussions we’re having let’s see where it ultimately takes us but clearly that’s what we’d like to see we think this drug is so very important for our military and we’re doing everything we can to make sure that there is appropriate supply available throughout the world and then i think the clinical question adrian if you don’t mind taking it adrian hepner sure scott so regarding the fourth study as we are growing our pipeline and expanding our clinical capabilities wall we are planning also to explore other therapeutic areas especially those will high unmet need where first in class will also be required to really address some devastating disorders and i look forward to providing more information in the near future scott tarriff tim the guideline – the guidance question is i think in the range that david provided to us we’re in pretty good shape with what we have planned internally there are other opportunities that are coming along in adrian’s area and in the formulation area if we’re fortunate enough to make movement on some of these other thoughts we have we may need to add to the range but right now i think we were very careful in how we provided guidance this morning tim lugo okay understood and maybe just a quick bendeka question i think when the initial guidance came out it seem like most on the street were just assuming the competitive products were hurting the franchise and the frontline it sounds like january and february shipments have been strong and obviously pricing wasn’t taken last year so overall how should we expect the kind of volume basis for bendamustine let’s call it over the next three years scott tarriff it’s a little bit hard to tell we’ve analyzed and we’ve had some outside experts analyze it we’ve listened to our partners we think the bendamustine market generally speaking is down a little bit lowsingle digits there’s a lot of reasons why bendamustine is still the product of choice in the category so we don’t see major differences we think that there is pricing powers totally outside of our control but in our models we actually have over a threeyear period of time bendeka flat to up not down when you take into account but again it’s outside of our responsibility but i’ll point out again that in our models we see bendeka as a growth driver certainly in  to take a shortterm approach to it going into january with a  plus share and we’re seeing that we have the  royalty now instead of the  clearly the opportunity for growth in  is pretty meaningful and we’re just really pleased where we are this year tim lugo understood thanks for all the clarity scott tarriff thank you tim are there any other questions operator there are no further questions at this time i would like to now turn the floor back over to scott tarriff for additional or closing remarks scott tarriff with that i would just like to say thank you i know it’s been a busy day for everyone thank you for spending the time with us obviously we’re enthusiastic about our business going forward we are doing everything we can to improve shareholder value it’s a very important focus and i’m sure we’ll be speaking quite a bit over the weeks going forward and again thank you operator wed like to thank everybody for their participation on todays conference call
