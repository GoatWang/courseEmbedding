videos tv photos profiles podcasts battleground send news contact us john cena talks not turning heel current wwe product being away from the company injured by marc middleton  april   source rolling stonejohn cena recently spoke with rolling stone for an indepth piece on his wwe career acting and more the full article is at this link and also contains comments from nikki bella below are highlights vince mcmahon and the wwe product im a yearold man id much rather it be a program geared toward me whether thats tv or sometimes even more graphic than that which is what i like for one thing profanity brought fire out of people with personalities that backed the language its very difficult to say oh youre being poopy especially when theyre meant to be fighting words and now if someone starts to bleed the referee intervenes to stop the bleeding but before youd just let it fly blood is one of the things that made fights cool like you knew it had gotten serious i understand why we dont do it anymore vince has been a coach to me a father figure a boss and a friend and his goal and my goal are the same to make the company be as big as it can be but yeah the blood is one thing i miss his injury and rehab its been two and a half months since the surgery and  rehab visits so far and im already doing things they said would take nine months i was antsy on day four being away from the product just makes me want it even more sure ok its very easy to get too caught up and not to mention the blur between real and not i mean anyone who brings up the word fake with me is truly ignorant of what we do we entertain were tv that develops right in front of you as it happens people think we are who they see thats kind of true but not i mean were as real as fake can get like im superman but im not although a lot of people in the business dont know when to turn the switch off i do and im john not turning heel look your job as a superstar is to manipulate the audience and try to tell your story i like the dynamic of the audience every single night its different but whats weird is that im a good guy because of all the kids and parents who like me and a bad guy because i wont turn heel which actually makes me both good guy and bad guy in one person check out the full interview with cena at this link follow marc middleton on twitter at thisismarc got a news tip or
