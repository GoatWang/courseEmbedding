advertising slogan “fill it to the rim — with brim” those ads haven’t been shown in years and brim itself has been off retail shelves since the s yet depending on how old you are there’s a fair chance that there’s some echo of the brim brand in your brain that’s no surprise given that from  to around  general foods spent tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to get it there but general foods disappeared into the conglomerate now known as altria which also acquired kraft maker of maxwell house with much smaller sales than that megabrand brim soon disappeared — except perhaps for a vague idea of brim that lingered and lingers even now in the minds of millions of consumerswhat’s that worth a small company in chicago called river west brands figures that it’s definitely worth something and possibly quite a lot the firm did its own research a year or so ago and claims that among people over the age of  brim had  percent “aided national awareness” what this means is that if you ask people anywhere in america if they have ever heard of brim about  out of  will say yes if true that’s potentially a big deal building that level of recognition for a new brand of coffee — or anything else — from scratch would involve an astronomical amount of money a great deal of time or bothmarketers like to talk about something called brand “equity” a combination of familiarity and positive associations that clearly has some sort of value even if it’s impossible to measure in a convincing empirical way exploiting the equity of dead or dying brands — sometimes called ghost brands orphan brands or zombie brands — is a topic many consumerproducts firms large and small have wrestled with for years river west’s approach is interesting for two reasonsone is that for the most part the equity — the idea — is the only thing the company is interested in owning river west acquires brands when the products themselves are dead not merely ailing aside from brim the brands it acquired in the last few years include underalls salon selectives nuprin and the game maker coleco among others “in most cases we’re dealing with a brand that only exists as intellectual property” says paul earle river west’s founder “there’s no retail presence no product no distribution no trucks no plants nothing all that exists is memory we’re taking consumers’ memories and starting entire businesses” advertisement continue reading the main story the other interesting thing is that when earle talks about consumer memory he is factoring in something curious the faultiness of consumer memory there is opportunity he says not just in what we remember but also in what we misremember continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story river west is a young company and few of its ideas have been directly tested in the marketplace the revival of brim for instance has yet to crystallize into a plan with real manufacturing and distribution partners but river west is starting to bring some familiar names back into the consumer realm it is thanks to river west that you can buy nuprin again at cvs the firm has also played a role in the return of eagle snacks to some grocerystore aisles in late january drugstorecom began accepting orders for salon selectives which is also making its way into  stores including every rite aid in america and grocery chains like winndixie and pathmark and by way of a deal with river west phantom a canadian hosiery manufacturer is pushing a new version of underalls to departmentstore and boutique clients in the uswhether these brandreanimation efforts pan out as a successful business strategy or not they offer an unusual perspective on the relationship between brands and the brain by and large examinations of successful branding tend to focus on names like harleydavidson apple or converse which have developed “cult” followings such cases are misleading though because they are not typical of most of what we buy a great deal of what happens in the consumer marketplace does not involve brands with zealous loyalists what determines whether a brand lives or dies or can even come back to life is usually a quieter process that has more to do with mental shortcuts and assumptions and memories — and all the imperfections that come along with each of those thingsriver west’s offices on the th floor of the chicago board of trade building are sprinkled with the bricabrac of obscure products a quisp cereal box ipana toothpaste packages duz detergent bottles on a wall of paul earle’s office is a framed fivefootbythreefoot sheet of uncut “wacky packages” stickers — those s tradingcardsize brandparody images that rendered the word crust in the style of the crest logo for example earle has a midwestern everyman quality about him he’s compact with a big and friendly let’sgetalong voice and a penchant for deadpan jokes only his designereyeglass frames deviate from his overall demeanor photo credit photograph by andrew bettles earle loves brands they are not mere commercial trademarks to him but pieces of americana he seems not just nostalgic but almost hurt about the fate of the “castoff brands” of the world “if commerce is part of the american fabric then brands are part of the american fabric” he said to me on one occasion “when a brand goes away a piece of americana goes away”earle’s professional entanglement with branding began at saatchi  saatchi where he was a cog in a gigantic ad agency working for gigantic clients like general mills and johnson  johnson that was in the mids and he saw what happened as conglomerates merged brands that didn’t have the potential for global scale got squeezed to the bottom shelf or out of existence he was attracted to the idea of working with “noncore” brands but when he figured out that bigagency economics made it impractical he left saatchi and went to the kellogg school of management at northwestern university and then took a brandmanagement job at kraftat kraft he observed the same mergersandconsolidation process from a different angle and he seems to have found it equally frustrating “these are american icons with loyal consumers” he says “it’s not their fault a  billion company doesn’t like them anymore consumers like them” he sees reviving brands as “a civic mission” of sorts “if it weren’t my job” he said “it would be my hobby” he says this in a way that sounds not just plausible but hard to doubteven so he has set out to make this particular civic mission turn a profit while he recognizes that a given brand might not be able to survive in the portfolio of a multinational different sorts of business models might work to sustain it as surely as the ownership of brands has consolidated through one megamerger after another the consumer market seems to be moving in the opposite direction with an individualismfueled demand for almost unlimited variety earle’s theory is that such demand means room for brands like the ones river west owns and his idea is facing its most significant test to date by way of the reanimation of salon selectives advertisement continue reading the main story helene curtis began selling this line of shampoos in  and sales shot past the  million mark within a year or so it was one wall street enthusiast claimed at the time “probably the most successful haircare launch in the history of the universe” heavily advertised the brand was a pioneer of the sales pitch now routine of a “salon” product available for home use unilever bought helene curtis in  acquiring a new batch of cosmetic shampoo and deodorant brands that had to be integrated into those the conglomerate already offeredit’s often hard to pin down the exact moment a brand disappears because a product can linger on retail shelves for quite a while before it’s sold down or otherwise liquidated but by the early s salon selectives had become a casualty of brandportfolio consolidation a few years later river west acquired what was left of it intellectual property like the trademarks and the original formulasriver west’s partner in the salon selectives effort is called ssb which has five fulltime employees coordinating the efforts of various subcontractors manufacturers packagemakers out of river west’s offices selective beauty is run by gene zeffren a former top executive at helene curtis with a phd in chemistry earle and zeffren are partly motivated by the belief that there is a core of salon selectives fans out there who miss their product and are eager to buy it again you would think then that the goal would be to give those consumers their old brand back just as it once was and sure enough when i visited anne west the chief marketing officer of the new salon selectives there was an array of pink plastic bottle samples in her office part of an attempt to match the old color as closely as possible she showed me a video in which a surprising number of randomly confronted chicagoans asked if they remembered salon selectives responded by singing the jinglethen she showed me storyboards for new salon selectives ads which were not much like the original ones at all she went on to explain that while the bottle color would be the same its shape would be different the reintroduced line also includes a number of new products and the products are now more aggressively marketed as “customizable” by hair length thickness texture etc than they were in the earlier incarnation then there’s the apple scent west said fans of the brand in its heyday frequently cited that signature smell as one of the things they missed most about the shampoos so the new version will have an apple scent — but even that was being tweaked and “updated” the bottom line is that salon selectives isn’t coming back just as it used to be but sort of as it used to bewest figures that fans of the brand who are nostalgic for their longlost product just need to know that it’s back but the real point now is to attract younger customers who probably never used the stuff the name “salon selectives” might sound familiar to them so the strategy must balance that familiarity with something that makes the product seem fresh and novel later west sent me the new salon selectives ads now running on vh lifetime and other cable networks the spots do not announce the return of a favorite old brand or even allude to the fact that salon selectives was ever gone in one a woman escapes from prison and immediately washes her hair the cop who confronts her admits that she doesn’t look like an escaped con but punch line as if she “just stepped out of a salon” this is followed by glimpses of the pink bottles and a quick “mix and match” pitch and then at the very last second a snippet of the familiar old jingle rerecorded west calls this snippet a “button” and it clearly aims to function as the slightest mental nudge this is something you know about photo credit photograph by andrew bettles among river west’s various projects this is actually one of the more conservative in testing the boundary between the positive associations of a familiar memory and the attractions of novelty there’s less room to test that boundary because salon selectives hasn’t been “dormant” all that long at least some fans of the old apple scent are going to have opinions about the “updated” version much will depend on specific associations with a product — which is not the same thing as a brand brands aren’t quite so tangible so quantifiable that’s what’s interesting about themone of paul earle’s professors at kellogg was john f sherry jr now at notre dame who has devoted some study to “retromarketing” and “the revival of brand meaning” in  he wrote an article with stephen brown of the university of ulster and robert v kozinets of kellogg on the subject for the journal of customer behavior “retromarketing is not merely a matter of reviving dormant brands and foisting them on softhearted dewyeyed nostalgiastricken consumers” they asserted “it involves working with consumers to cocreate an oasis of authenticity for tired and thirsty travelers through the desert of massproduced marketing dreck”i wasn’t entirely sure what that meant but sherry turned out to be more straightforward in conversation “there’s no real reason that a brand needs to die” he told me unless it is attached to a product that “functionally doesn’t work” that is as long as a given product can change to meet contemporary performance standards “your success is really dependent on how skillful you are in managing the brand’s story so that it resonates with meaning that consumers like” advertisement continue reading the main story the holy grail example of brand reanimation is the volkswagen beetle which a few years ago rose from dormancy and became a hit all over again in an updated form that was both nostalgic and contemporary the reintroduced beetle layered “nostalgic reassurance” over modern functionality “it’s a brand that’s memorable for a lot of different reasons” sherry said “but largely because it evokes this past that never was — that was morally superior or simpler an era of better craftsmanship that kind of thing”such abstract notions are much on display at the licensing international expo an annual event at which the owners of cultural properties — tv shows movies cartoon characters — meet with makers of things and try to negotiate deals granting them a paid license to use the properties to add meaning and market value to whatever things they make it is a good place to contemplate the business potential of “the brand” in freefloating form unmoored to any product or company that may have actually created it a surprising number of the symbols represented at the expo held last summer in new york were simply brand logos spam for instance had its own booth imc licensing was there on behalf of its clients oreo altoids dole and oscar mayer at one point i encountered a person dressed up as a can of lysol which is represented by the licensing companyanother firm that represents a number of consumer brands is the beanstalk group which staked out a rather large chunk of floor space at the expo complete with a coffee bar and about  tables owned by omnicom group beanstalk is the licensing firm for a wide range of cultural properties from harleydavidson to andy warhol to the united states army none of these are dead brands of course but beanstalk’s track record with converting brand meaning into revenue is the reason paul earle was at the licensing expo beanstalk was exploring strategies to revive the coleco and brim brands as essentially licensing foddermichael stone the president and chief executive of beanstalk has a refined sense of the licensing business and how consumer brands fit into it he knows what many people think the business boils down to i make plastic lunchboxes and you own the rights to reproduce images of spiderman how about a spiderman lunchbox stone cheerfully explained to me that this is merely a “decorative” form of licensing and that’s not his game as a point of contrast he told me about beanstalk’s involvement with stanley works the venerable maker of hand toolsstanley hired beanstalk about nine years ago stanley conducted “consumer permission research” to try to determine where the stanley brand could go “i remember looking through the focusgroup tests and there was a guy who absolutely swore that he had a stanley ladder in his garage” stone paused “stanley never made ladders” this is an excellent example of what “brand equity” really means in the marketplacein contrast to the fanaticaldevotion theory part of the point of most branding is very specifically to circumvent conscious thought psychologists use the word “heuristics” to refer to the mental shortcuts and rules of thumb that allow us to resolve the various routine problems of everyday life without having to make a spreadsheet for every trivial decision brand owners want a way into your purchase heuristics often it is not so much a matter of say a stanley works fanatic seeking out all products bearing that trademark it’s a matter of looking for a product and choosing one with a particular trademark that for whatever reason we find acceptable this is not brand loyalty it’s brand acquiescence photo credit photograph by gaslight ad archives we’ve all seen the stanley name for instance and by and large we trust it we have a general idea of stanley that fits into our hardwarestore purchase heuristics but there is a great deal of imperfection and vagueness in these thought processes and that is good news for a licensor it suggests that there’s potential — or “permission” — for the stanley name to migrate onto new productswhat beanstalk did not do when it took on stanley as a client was recommend investing in a ladderproduction facility and hiring a bunch of workers plus a sales force to blitz potential retail channels stanley works as a company has actually been moving in the opposite direction closing factories and outsourcing its manufacturing since the s instead beanstalk worked out a licensing deal with werner which was already the biggest maker and distributor of ladders in the country “they needed another brand because they couldn’t expand the werner brand anymore” stone said so werner started making and selling ladders with the stanley name on them this gave werner a way to get more shelf space reach more consumers and make more sales what it gave stanley was its name on a new product and a licensing fee beanstalk has worked out many such deals hooking up the stanley brand with manufacturers of work gloves and boots power generators and a variety of other things that stanley never made and does not make now advertisement continue reading the main story too many such deals or the wrong kinds can boomerang this happens with some regularity in the fashion world when a famous designer name gets spread over so many products with so little regard to quality that the entire image of the brand sinks still if you see a ladder made by stanley you may well think well there’s a name i can trust what you’re trusting though isn’t stanley workers in stanley factories upholding stanley traditions and values under the watchful eye of stanley managers what you’re trusting is stanley’s recognition that a badly made ladder with the stanley name on it could be highly damaging to the stanley brand you are trusting stanley’s recognition of the value of its

back around to beanstalk’s ideas for river west’s brands particularly brim stone mentioned white cloud white cloud is a brand of toilet paper once owned by procter  gamble p g also owned the charmin franchise so eventually it let the trademarks on white cloud expire these were then acquired by an entrepreneur who worked out a licensing deal with walmart to make white cloud an exclusive walmart product it became essentially a store brand but infused with equity of massmarket familiarity it’s very doubtful that the typical white cloud buyer is aware that the product is available only at walmart it’s also very doubtful that p g which would surely prefer that its charmin didn’t have to compete against a brand that p g itself created will let anything like that happen again if it can possibly help itthis is essentially the situation that river west brokered with the nuprin brand which was a dead line of ibuprofen painkillers once upon a time backed by the widely known “nupe it” ad campaign its trademarks were acquired by river west and sold to cvs where it is back on the shelves as a stealth store brand and presumably enjoying better margins than it would if like a traditional store brand it competed solely on low price not trustworthybrand familiarity my read was that this is what stone thought should happen to brim — and that earle had mixed feelings believing perhaps that brim could come back as something bigger even stone seemed at least somewhat intrigued with the possibilities of licensing a brand that was familiar but dead “with stanley we have to be careful — this is a famous brand we have to do everything right and mitigate all the risks” he says “but with brim the risks   ” he paused “there really are no risks”this brings us to earle’s ideas about the potential upside of faulty consumer memory maybe for instance you’re among those who remember brim but do you also remember that it was a decafonly brand that’s actually why you could “fill it to the rim” river west’s research found that many who recall the brim brand have forgotten the decaf detailthe relationship between brands and memory faulty or no is a specialty of kathy latour an associate professor at the university of nevada las vegas in one of her most interesting studies she worked with elizabeth loftus a memory specialist and now a professor at the university of california irvine and a third researcher rhiannon ellis to take the issue to its logical extreme what if for example an advertising campaign “implanted memories into consumers of things that never happened”the researchers found that subjects presented with a fake disney world ad inviting them to “remember the characters of your youth mickey goofy    ” were significantly more likely to say they recalled that as children they had met “a favorite tv character at a theme resort” than those who didn’t see the ad the fascinating thing was what happened when they repeated the experiment tweaking the ads to include bugs bunny who of course is not a disney character at all about  percent of subjects subsequently claimed that as children they shook hands with bugs bunny at a disney theme park repeated fakead exposure apparently led to higher falsememory rates in a separate study loftus asked subjects with bugs in their memories what exactly they recalled about this incident of these  percent recounted shaking bugs’s hand and more than a quarter specifically recalled him saying “what’s up doc”earle says that this imperfection of memory can be used to enhance whatever new brim he comes up with this is “a benefit of dormancy” he says the brand equity has value on its own but it can be grafted onto something newer and perhaps more innovative “consumers remember the kind of highlevel essence of the brand” he says “they tend to forget the product specifics” this he figures creates an opening it gives the reintroduced version “permission” to forget that decafonly limitation as well and morph into a full line of coffee varieties “ ‘fill it to the rim with brim’ stands for fullflavored coffee” earle says with a chuckle “fill it to the rim — it’s great stuff” photo river west brands is helping revive three ghost brands that had largely disappeared from store shelves  underalls formerly owned by hanes  salon selectives last owned by unilever  eagle snacks once owned by anheuserbusch credit top and middle left gaslight ad archives bottom left and right top to bottom river west brands llc and affiliates finding the deceased brands that consumers are likely to remember — sort of — is a process that can begin of all places in the library earle spent hours going through old issues of people time glamour and other magazines “looking for brand names that sounded familiar but that i hadn’t seen lately” this results in many many possibilities that don’t work out for one reason or another but every so often the process yields an underallsearle was intrigued with underalls produced by hanes from about  to the mids underalls was once a prominent brand advertised aggressively “ok america — show us your underalls” it spawned “flanker” brands like summeralls winteralls and slenderalls it was unique and memorable a good brand “you see the memorabilia on ebay” earle says “that’s usually a good indicator” advertisement continue reading the main story by way of markettools a research company river west asked  women ages  to  to answer an online survey about hosiery brands about  did so and among these  percent had heard of underalls among those who recognized the brand about threequarters remembered the “show us your underalls” tagline promising but river west needed a partner to actually manufacture and distribute whatever the new version of underalls might beit found that partner in phantom a hosiery maker based in toronto phantom’s main product line is called silks the dominant hosiery brand in canada the company also manufactures a number of store brands phantom wanted to get into the crowded us hosiery market says svetlana sturgeon vice president of sales and marketing for phantom and it made a certain amount of sense to leverage a name far more familiar to american consumers than silks would be sturgeon jokes that at first she did not want to admit at meetings that she remembered the brand “i’m much too young for that” but she didthe point of the original underalls was that they combined panties and stockings into one undergarment “they were the pioneers in the whole idea of eliminating panty lines” is how sturgeon puts this in early brainstorming sessions phantom and river west tried to come up with “the most expansive but credible definition” of the brand earle says in this case that turned out to be “intimateapparel solutions” which means anything you wear under something else that’s “functional and fashionforward” sturgeon says this includes camisoles and bras and other things the original underalls never sold the san francisco design firm thinc came up with a new graphic identity and packaging ideas that referenced classic elements of the old ads but radically updated them new slogan “lovely underneath it all” with the prototypes complete sturgeon has begun the process of meeting with boutique and departmentstore buyers in the hope of getting products into stores at least on a test level in the fallbrand familiarity alone guarantees nothing sears owns several wellknown brand names — kenmore craftsman diehard the sears name itself — and is viewed by wall street as a basket case multinationals routinely go through cycles of acquiring and creating brands and then paring back when inevitably some underperform a tiny number of hardcore loyalists not only doesn’t mean a whole lot when reviving a brand it might be a problem because those people do remember a number of the more cultish devotees of the vw beetle in fact forthrightly rejected its reanimated version as a fraud in that case those consumers were marginalized by a far wider buying public who weren’t such sticklersand really something like the beetle is actually a special case it wasn’t just a wellknown product it was a cultural icon on a level that very few products or brands ever achieve river west is trying to reanimate brands that are sort of familiar but don’t have anything like a vw level of builtin cultural capital to draw on if there is a cult of brim out there somewhere it’s pretty small and very quietwhat river west really wants is to bring back these brands in a way that not only builds on their former popularity but also manages via the skillful management of what we do remember and what we don’t to transcend it this would be quite a trick a few months after he returned from the licensing expo earle more or less dropped the strategy of turning brim into a glorified store brand these days he’s talking about finding a “really innovative” coffeemanufacturing partner who could make the brim brand an umbrella for groundbreaking but unspecified coffee advances that would work in the general market not just one chain he sounded almost protective of the brim idea and possibly a bit frustrated that he hadn’t hit on the way to bring it back “brim is within our company one of our bestknown brands” he said to me at one point “in fact it’s our absolutely bestknown brand so expectations are high”later he added “the strength of a dormant brand is we can remake this however we want the challenge is we can remake this however we want” eventually earle introduced me at his office to scott lazar chief executive of another river west partner reserve brands which is overseeing the revivification of eagle snacks i’d never heard of the brand but i was assured that plenty of midwesterners knew it eagle had once been owned by anheuserbusch and was the beer maker’s way into the saltysnack market dominated by fritolay its most well known product it seems was the honeyroasted peanut particularly in tiny bags given out as snacks on airlines anheuserbusch eventually pulled the plug selling its equipment to fritolay and the trademarks to procter  gamble in the mids lazar said that while the new eagle has acquired those trademarks the new and expanded product line consists largely of snacks that the old eagle never made with names like “poppers” and “bursts” these are rolling out in a variety of grocery stores across the country lazar tried to give me about six large bags of samples but i demurred on account of limited luggage spacei ended up with two bags which earle and i took downstairs to the bar at the ceres cafe it was crowded and loud filled with big chicago men who in some cases had spent the day screaming on the chicago board of trade floor and who in all cases were not shy we found a place to sit plopping the eagle snacks in front of us and one man after another leaned into our space and pointed at the bags and boomed “eagle” big hands reached toward the bags to get a scoop of snacks that the old eagle had never made and at the time were not in stores and big voices declared “i remember those” continue reading the main story
