oncotype dx prostate cancer test was developed to help men newly diagnosed with earlystage prostate cancer to make the most informed treatment decision for their individual disease including active surveillance  the vast majority of men currently diagnosed with lowrisk prostate cancer undergo surgery or radiation treatment although there is only a three percent chance that their disease will become lifethreatening in response to this issue genomic health’s biopsybased multigene test has been clinically validated to predict aggressive cancer at the time of diagnosis helping to identify those men who need immediate surgery or radiation therapy versus those who can confidently choose active surveillance using minimal tumor tissue from the original needle biopsy the test builds on traditional clinical and pathologic factors to provide additional clinically relevant insight into the underlying tumor biology of an individual patient before the prostate is removed the result is a more precise and accurate assessment of risk which helps more men avoid the lifelong complications associated with treatments they do not need while directing aggressive therapy to those men who require immediate treatment with  prostate cancer studies including more than  patients we have developed and validated the only genomic test to assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and predict both near and longterm outcomes to enable more precise patient risk stratification and better informed treatment decisions giving physicians the confidence to place many low to intermediaterisk patients on active surveillance  it also helps physicians identify those patients who might be missed by conventional measures and who may benefit from more aggressive treatment the oncotype dx prostate cancer test is now covered for qualified patients by medicare in the united states giving nearly  prostate cancer patients the opportunity to personalize their cancer treatment go
