investments we monitor the fundamentals of the market continually to review we believe that longterm stock prices are driven by  broad fundamental metrics they are the health of the economythe profitability of the companies operating within the economymarket and individual stock price valuations today let’s do a quick review of the economy one of the broadest measures of the economy is gross domestic product gdp gdp has been growing at a moderate and fairly stable pace the last five years the chart below illustrates how the us economy has been growing between  and  on an annual basis recently the gdp growth rate has slowed down closer to the  range this is concerning if the growth rate doesn’t accelerate a reading over  is much more indicative of a healthier economy let’s break down our economy into two broad sectors first the manufacturing sector of the economy has been dwindling over time but is still important and comprises roughly  of the us economy every month the “institute for supply management” or ism reports a pmi index which highlights economic activity in the manufacturing sector a reading above  indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding below  indicates that it is generally contracting in august the pmi came in at  down from  in july the chart below highlights that the manufacturing pmi has not been below  the border between expansion and contraction since february of  secondly we need to look at ism’s pmi index for the allimportant services sector of our economy the us service sector slowed to a sixyear low in august according to ism the pmi index on the service sector came in at  for august down from  in july that’s still growth but it’s the lowest reading since february  when the index pulled out of contractionary territory for good following the  financial crisis see the chart below highlighting service sector pmi readings the august slowdowns in both the manufacturing and services sector of the economy point to a potential anemic gdp growth rate again in the rd quarter of  in fact chris williamson chief economist of markit says “taken together the manufacturing and services pmis are pointing to an annualized gdp growth rate of a mere  suggesting that those looking for a strengthening in the rate of economic growth will be disappointed once again monthly data can be volatile especially during the summer but we’ll certainly be keeping an eye on upcoming economic reports to determine if the august slowdown was an outlier or a trend gradient investments llc  home gradient investments

hits new record highs only to be followed by more record levels this should be a euphoric time for investors where bull markets typically end in tragedy instead investors remain overly cautious expecting something disastrous at any moment the longer investor nervousness continues the longer this bull market will run the economic data fully supports the bull market the political and social headlines are successfully distracting investors from what really matters corporate earnings the stock market is celebrating a strong first quarter of corporate earnings and earnings estimates for the second quarter look even better add to this low unemployment rates stable interest rates benign inflation and most of all a healthy consumer and we have a recipe for record breaking days on wall street stock returns were positive around the globe in the second quarter as emerging markets and international developed stocks outperformed us stocks international markets are in the midst of a solid run offsetting some recently troubled years a recent acceleration in overseas economic growth and compelling valuations is being reflected in international stock prices the us market had been riding the technology wave through early june when the tide turned for a brief moment growth stocks are crushing value stock investing in the first half of the year energy has been the primary laggard as oil prices found their way to the low end of a recent  a barrel range a widely anticipated federal reserve rate hike came as advertised after their midjune meeting the federal reserve is on a quarterly mission to raise shortterm interest rates and return to a normal monetary policy the fed funds target rate now sits at  in addition to adjusting monetary policy the fed also must reduce their inflated balance sheet by selling trillions of bonds they purchased during the multiple post financial crisis quantitative easing programs this process will begin later this year and will take years to unwind expect relative stability in bonds as rates remain low but inch higher over time the year us treasury finished the quarter with a  yield after reaching a low yield for the year of  in june the yield curve continues to flatten as the short end reacts to the fed rate hikes and the long end celebrates low inflation credit spreads are locked in at the tightest levels of the year thanks to the strong equity market and a healthy risk appetite from investors investment grade spreads and high yield spreads remain very tight helping these sectors outperform the overall bond market interest rates are low stock prices are high and this scenario will likely continue well into the third quarter stock prices will be supported by a new round of earning releases which comes on the heels of the best earnings quarter since  expect more good news on this front with credit spreads tight and interest rates low don’t expect too much from bonds in the second half of  the first half of the year has exceeded our fixed income return expectations so flat returns in the second half would be a win stocks should continue to ride high on the corporate earnings train markets by the numbers

alltime highs publicly traded companies are just beginning to report sales and earnings for the second quarter of  over the next couple of weeks we will be watching for a number of data points within

sp  in fact sp earnings were in decline for four quarters mid  to mid with the drop attributed to just one sector energy for the first quarter of  we saw earnings growth of  we expect  growth in the second quarter we currently expect earnings growth to accelerate in the second half of this year providing a strong foundation for the stock market looking further out consensus earnings growth of nearly  is expected for  according to factset as seen in the chart below source factset earnings insight as of july   a company’s earnings growth is not the only driver of a stock’s price however in fact a study by mckinsey  co showed that a  beat had virtually no impact of the price of a company stock five days after the earnings announcement often companies will guide analysts’ expectations down prior to the quarterly report in an effort to create a beat…managing expectations some might say more important we believe is the quality of earnings and management’s outlook versus current expectations we look for sales and earnings growth from core operations not boosted by onetime events or shifts from one quarter to the next we want to see expanding operating margins not an earnings benefit from a onetime item such as a lower tax rate investors should be encouraged by management’s discussion of rising orders or new technology that will grow the business over the longer term is the sector showing greater growth characteristics than most have expected management sentiment around improved operating efficiencies or a more suitable capital structure are other positive factors that can drive stock prices higher yes a series of disappointments will impact the price of a stock over time the disappointments would create distrust in management’s ability to accomplish their goals similarly a pattern of significantly exceeding expectations will lead to stock price outperformance however a single disappointment if accompanied by an improved short andor long term outlook can result in positive stock price performance we believe we are in a period of rising earnings which tends to be positive for stock prices stay tuned  mckinsey  co strategy  corporate finance   past

successful investors are not who you think they are if you ask people who the most successful investors are you get responses like warren buffett of berkshire hathaway john neff formerly of vanguards windsor fund or george soros the famous hedge fund operator however some of the most successful investors from a riskreward perspective are the large university endowment funds this group includes universities with endowments larger than  billion such as yale university and harvard university large endowment funds have consistently beat the market on a riskadjusted basis these funds diversify away from traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds by investing in lesser known asset classes such as currency private equity commodities and absolute return strategies these lesser known asset classes have the capability to deliver profits over a business cycle the same opportunities are now available to individual investors via lowcost publiclytraded etfs within our endowment series endowment series flyer gradient laddered income one of the most effective investment strategies available to fund future cash flow needs is to build a bond ladder the gradient laddered income strategy is constructed by purchasing diverse fixed income instruments that mature at regular intervals from three to seven years out after the nearest security matures the proceeds are reinvested into a new year or they are spent to cover planned expenditures the fundamental investment theme behind a bond ladder is diversification by maturity it also curbs reinvestment risk as the portfolio produces a steady stream of cash flow maturity specific etfs and other liquid investment vehicles are now available to the individual investor allowing for liquidity lowcost and diversification all within a particular maturity year the gradient laddered income strategy is a unique custom portfolio combining the best of bond mutual funds and individual bonds to create yield and immediate cash flow laddered income flyer gradient covered call the covered call portfolio uses etfs as the underlying investment vehicle the allocation is unique in that the etfs used are approximately  percent growth  percent bond and  percent inverse to the stock market we then actively manage a monthly covered call strategy on the underlying etfs to generate additional cash flow and reduce investment risk the covered call portfolio complements an existing fixed income strategy while focusing on conservative risk adjusted returns the inverse position provides a natural hedge against the markets movements and therefore reduces overall risk and provides downside protection the covered call portfolio is an ideal solution for the client looking for an incomeproducing portfolio with upside potential and downside protection covered call flyer gradient absolute yield the gradient absolute yield portfolio invests globally for high current income this is a diverse portfolio with the flexibility to seek out the asset classes providing the most attractive yields in the global marketplace gradient investments employs a broad based approach to identify high yielding securities across multiple asset classes as a multiasset portfolio it can freely move between high yield bonds equities emerging market debt master limited partnerships preferred stocks senior bank loans and other investments to access global income the gradient investment team seeks the most attractive asset valuations to insure high income and broad diversification to lower portfolio volatility the gradient absolute yield portfolio solves a major dilemma many investors face today – how to generate meaningful income in a low interest rate environment traditional sources of income such as certificates of deposit savings accounts or bonds no longer keep pace with inflation this globally diverse portfolio goes beyond traditional fixed income classes and is keenly focused on generating high current income absolute yield flyer gradient fixed income series fixed income assets are often misunderstood but at gradient we understand the complexities of investing in bonds our fixed income portfolios are carefully designed for longterm investors seeking current income through a diversified approach the main goal of the fixed income program is to provide investors with current income and relative price stability by building diversified portfolios across all fixed income sectors our investment strategy uses a bottomup fundamental research approach to identify solid fixed income investment opportunities producing a reliable income stream with relative price stability fixed income series flyer gradient precious metals historically precious metals such as platinum silver and gold have been a source of stability and an extremely effective tool in uncertain economic times owning a diversified portfolio of precious metals as a part of an overall investment strategy can act as a hedge against market turmoil there are numerous ways to purchase and own precious metals and owning a portfolio of exchange traded funds etf and no load mutual funds provides several distinct advantages over the physical possession of these metals such advantages include diversification liquidity and pricing and custody additionally owning a portfolio etfs and no load mutual funds allows for investing in precious
