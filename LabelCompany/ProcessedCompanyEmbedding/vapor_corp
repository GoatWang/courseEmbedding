tried ecigarettes this number is up  from  currently about  of all adults have tried vapor smoking which is nearly double the estimate in  a number of trends including legality social acceptability health reasons cost effectiveness increased awareness and increased variety are driving the growing adoption of ecigarettes while legislators banned tobacco cigarettes in public places across the nation ecigarettes are not as regulated some cities such as new york chicago and long beach have placed similar prohibitions on the use of ecigarettes to the prohibition placed on traditional cigarettes but overall consumers can use ecigarettes in the vast majority of cities this creates significant demand for ecigarettes particularly in cold weather locations as smokers can get their nicotine fix indoors ecigarette industry participants expect a nationwide age restrictions and a restriction on tv advertising the restriction on tv advertising would be a benefit for vapor corp as the larger players are currently advertising on tv while vapor corp does not have the scale or marketing budget to advertise a ban would level the playing field ecigarettes are more socially acceptable than traditional cigarettes for many the unacceptable part of traditional cigarettes is smoke and the smell of the smoke unlike traditional cigarettes ecigarettes do not produce smoke this leads to a lower level of intrusion and a higher level of social acceptance a harris interactive survey the  american ecigarette etiquette survey confirmed the social acceptance with nearly  of americans stating someone using an ecigarette near them would not bother them ecigarettes are less of a health risk than traditional cigarettes with traditional cigarettes smokers are inhaling a number of additives that cause cancer including tar benzene formaldehyde arsenic ammonia and carbon monoxide nicotine itself does not cause cancer it is a stimulant similar to caffeine stimulants increase your heart rate speeds up other bodily functions and constrict blood vessels both are highly addictive and can cause severe withdrawal symptoms making it difficult to quit ecigarettes are more effective than patches or gum at helping smokers stop quitting as it replicates the process of smoking the process of smoking becomes almost as addictive as nicotine with some estimating  of the addiction is the process of placing a cigarette to your lips the patch carries other disadvantages such as potential visibility side effects and inability of the user to control the dosage a study conducted by the national institute for health innovation at the university of auckland showed the percentage of ecigarette quitters was higher than nicotine patches and placebo at   and  respectively the study also showed relapsed ecigarette users smoked less of the volunteers in the ecigarette group  halved their daily cigarette use by the end of the  months compared with only  in the nicotine patches group and  in the placebo group according to the center for disease control in   of adult smokers wanted to quit smoking and  attempted to quit with such a high desire to quit the effectiveness of ecigarettes and the similarities to the smoking process ecigarettes are an attractive option to quit or decrease their usage the total market for smoking cessation products such as nicotine patches and gum is estimated at  million ecigarettes are also cheaper than traditional cigarettes as illustrated above vapor corp disposable king size product is about  cheaper per puff than a traditional cigarette at an average us cigarette price of  per pack the tobacco atlas places the average pack of cigarettes at  in the us confirm the  price per pack according to vizualstatistix in  the average us smoker smoked  cigarettes a day at a consumption rate of  cigarettes per day the average smoker in the us saves  per year with ecigarettes the disposable king size ecigarette is the most expensive product over a year savings would be much more if the consumer purchased a rechargeable product or a vaporizer product on a conservative measure a smoker would save a minimum of  per year switching to ecigarettes ecigarettes are gaining increased awareness as ecigarette manufactures njoy and blu are advertising heavily njoy had a commercial during the super bowl and blu enlisted celebrities stephen dorff and jenny mccarthy to promote their products legislators banned tobacco advertising from television in  and banned from outdoor advertising in  giving a significant advantage to ecigarettes to increase appeal ecigarettes are available in a wide variety of flavors this should entice social smokers regulators banned tobacco companies from adding any flavors to traditional cigarettes the growing adoption of ecigarettes is driven by a number of trends including legality social acceptability health reasons cost effectiveness increased awareness and increased variety should continue competitive landscape there are more than  ecigarette producers the number of competitors is decreasing but competitive pressures are increasing as the large tobacco companies are entering the fray lorillard nyselo the third largest tobacco company and maker of newport cigarettes was the first to enter the ecigarette market with its april  purchase of blu in february  altria nysemo the largest us tobacco company and maker of marlboro acquired green smoke to enter the ecigarette market reynolds american nyserai the second largest us tobacco company and maker of camel entered the market in  with their own ecigarette offering vuse the increased competition from larger players will lead to an eventual consolidation in the market with  players at the end of the industry shakeout as economies of scale will be present in the market vapor corp believes there will be  large players and  second tier players with the three large tobacco players and one other player in the toptier the large fixed costs associated with marketing and potential regulatory costs will likely eliminate smaller players marketing is particularly important at the early stages of an industry life cycle when no brand has established itself as the clear leader and all companies are trying to increase brand awareness vapor corp mentions ecigarettes are seeing  repeat business pointing to a strong brand loyalty similar to the tobacco industry limited shelf space at retailers creates another important market inefficiency as the fda may ban online sales of ecigarettes the access to retail outlets will be one of the key determinants of survival the large tobacco companies will gain access given their relationships from traditional tobacco but for smaller companies this will be important to monitor as discussed earlier lorillards blu has the largest retail presence in over  retail outlets njoy is in over  retail outlets vapor corporations products are available in over  retail outlets mistic sells its ecigarettes in over  stores nationwide the recent merger between victory and finn increased the combined entities retail presence to over  stores nationwide logics ecigarettes are in  retail outlets market size electronic cigarettes sales grew from almost nothing five years ago to roughly  million in  and over  billion in  ecigarettes presence is illustrated by  of tobacco retailers carrying at least one ecigarette brand the growth in the market will continue wells fargo and bloomberg industries estimate ecigarettes sales will surpass traditional cigarettes within the next decade the us tobacco industry is a  billion industry the most optimistic scenario puts the us ecigarette market at over  billion in ten years representing a  compound annual growth rate and the global opportunity at  billion in  years assuming nogrowth in the overall tobacco market size and  cannibalization of tobacco cigarettes sales ecigarettes sales could reach  billion in  years representing almost  growth per year using a more conservative estimate of  of total traditional cigarette sales the ecigarette industry could reach  billion over the next decade or a compound annual growth rate of over  per year for the next decade a recent study by linarch research and citi placed the ecigarette market size at  billion at the end of  they estimate the market size will triple to  billion by the end of  why buy now in october  the company completed a  million private placement of common stock according to vapor corp  of ecigarette buyers are repeat buyers pointing to a brand loyalty similar to tobacco industry where customers are extremely fussy about which cigarettes they smoke first mover advantage and locking in customers are crucial to having a strong competitive position any capital to aid this goal is crucial on december   family dollar nysefdo stores across the us started selling krave® king brand of disposable ecigarette products vapors products are now in more than  retail outlets in the us and canada as mentioned above the companys store count is one of the largest in the industry distribution and the ability to gain shelf space is a key barrier to entry in the industry and vapor corp being one of the leaders in the industry with its products in more than  retail outlet gives them a very strong competitive position on december   the company announced a for reverse stock split to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement in order to seek listing of the common stock on the nasdaq capital market the company expects an up listing to the nasdaq capital market by the middle of  this will increase the number of investors able to invest in vapor corp on january   vapor corp unveiled the

purchased dragonite international in september  in october  lorillard increased its ecigarette offering and geographical presence with its acquisition of european ecigarette skycig imperials acquisition of dragonite international was an ip acquisition neither victory nor vapesticks previous owners provided revenue figures with the information available the average enterprise valuesales multiple was x given the recent acquisitions in the industry have been on an average evsales multiple of x and given the projected growth in the industry and vapor corps strong competitive position it could see revenues triple over the next  years from  million in  to  million in  placing the x evsales on projected  revenues vapor corps ev should be  million or an annualized return of  over the next  years technical analysis by harry boxer thetechtradercom vapor corp moved from under  to near  from may to december  over the flowing  months it pulled back to test the  level near the major rising channel bottom support and last week bounced off that support to get back to just under  the month rising channel and solid technicals indicate higher levels may be forth coming first vapor corps stock price needs to retest and take out of that  resistance zone if that occurs our technical price objectives are set at   and then  risks the ecigarette industry could face increasing regulation regulators have clamped down on ecigarette use in some areas of the country placing restrictions on ecigarettes similar to the restrictions on traditional cigarettes as mentioned above the ecigarette industry is extremely competitive vapor corp is competing against large tobacco companies with very deep pockets and strong political connections vapor corp has a strong competitive position based on its retail presence and product offering the most diverse of any ecigarette company to increase retail network and brand presence will take capital vapor corp may need additional funding which could dilute existing shareholders vapor corp currently trades on the otc market and its stock has limited liquidity there may be an impact to price when making large purchases and sales the expectation of listing on nasdaq will help conclusion vapor corp is a leading player in the nascent ecigarette industry the ecigarette industry could grow at  per year over the next decade due to increased adoption driven by a number of trends including legality social acceptability health reasons cost effectiveness increased awareness and increased variety vapor corp has the third largest retail presence behind blu and njoy the companys products are in over  retail outlets in the united states compared to blus store count of over  and njoy in over  retail outlets retail presence is a

news  marketing  management  vapor corp leads ecigarette market with unique brands vapor corp leads ecigarette market with unique brands march   by rory j thompson with both health concerns and smoking prohibitions rising more and more smokers are turning to electronic cigarettes to satisfy their nicotine craving which is just fine with vapor corp “we’re not only the largest electronic cigarette manufacturer in the industry but we’re also the only publicly traded one” says adam frija director of business development at the florida based company vapor corp was founded by a team of veteran entrepreneurs with extensive experience ranging from product and brand development to manufacturing and sales of various consumer products “the company’s innovative personal vaporizers offer cigarette smokers a better smoking alternative as they’re designed to allow smokers greater freedom and enable them to smoke in public places” frija says vapor corp’s products eliminate the danger of secondhand smoke to the nonsmoking community the company began by selling its products in mall kiosks and eventually expanded into wholesaling to other kiosk owners “we went from being in about five kiosks to more than  in just one year” frija says because of the exposure in malls vapor corp began to develop relationships with convenience stores independent retailers the supermarket industry and even pharmacy chains they then reached out to distributors across the country “all told it only took about three years from the beginning until now” frija says the company now focuses on the wholesaling side promoting its two biggest sellers in the personal vaporizer line the smoke  rechargeable brand and the krave disposable ecigarette “personal vaporizers are electronic devices the functional elements of which are integrated into a stainless steel shell and include a small plastic cartridge that contains an absorbent material moistened with a propyleneglycol liquid solution” frija says “that solution may or may not contain nicotine tobacco flavoring or other flavor essences an electronic airflow sensor a heating element which vaporizes the liquid in the mouthpiece so that it can be inhaled a rechargeable lithium ion battery which powers the device and certain electronic components” he adds the smoke  allows a user the freedom to smoke virtually anywhere without the flame ash tar or carbon monoxide found in traditional tobacco cigarettes because it’s rechargeable it can be used over and over again saving the smoker considerable costs in not having to buy cigarettes for smokers who want to try an ecigarette without committing vapor corp also manufactures the krave  and krave  disposable versions of the smoke  that are good for up to  and  puffs respectively “these unique electronic cigarettes are one piece units meaning there are no atomizers to screw in no filters to replace and no batteries to recharge” frija says “they’re ready to enjoy right out of the pack” once a user is done with a krave they simply dispose of the entire unit the smoke  comes in two options with everything a smoker needs to enjoy an ecigarette the fifty one duo wholesales for  to  depending on volume ordered and the fifty one trio ranges from  to  again depending on which packaging option is requested the units retail for at least double that and markups go as high as  percent depending on traffic and store location the krave and  disposable ecigarettes feature an equally high retail return there is no minimum order but frija notes that some outlets request a few units initially and then increase their order when they see how well they sell “some cigar shops order six or  at a time” he says volume discounts are available depending on how many of each product are ordered and display pieces are available for retailers who request them “krave is a pos purchase item so we have a display rack that holds anywhere between  and  pieces” frija says “we also have an inhouse graphic design department and are flexible to work with retailers as some want the signage narrower taller or wider to fit their specific needs” for new customers vapor corp will work with them to get the best possible pricing “we do have tiered distribution and pricing is based on volume” frija says “right now brick and mortar mom and pop and convenience stores are seeing a lot of traffic with the krave” he adds vapor corp is constantly introducing new packaging as word of the product spreads “we have both gift sets and starter sets for new customers” frija says “they contain everything a smoker needs to experience this new technology” for more information vapor corp  w hallandale blvd suite  hallandale fl  tel  toll free  fax  email adamfrijavaporcorpcom
