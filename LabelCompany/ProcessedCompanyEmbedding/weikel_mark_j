rehearing andor transfer to supreme court denied march   lawrence g crahan judge the may department stores company may appeals a judgment declaring that its former employee mark j weikel weikel would not be in violation of the noncompetition provisions of his employment contract by accepting a position with victorias secret stores inc vss we affirm weikel was employed by may as chairman of its foleys department store foleys division in  weikel and may entered into an employment agreement agreement whereby weikel would render personal services to foleys from may   until april   later extended to april   in the agreement weikel agreed to the following provision at all times while you are employed by may and for two years after your employment terminates you will not directly or indirectly i own manage operate finance join control advise consult render services to have an interest or future interest in or participate in the ownership management operation financing or control of or be employed by or connected in any manner with any competing business  the section of the agreement defining competing business provides competing business includes but is not limited to i any x retail department store specialty store or other retail business that sells goods or merchandise of the types sold in mays or its subsidiaries or divisions stores at retail to consumers or y any group of such stores or businesses or any other business that a competes for customers suppliers employees or any other resource with may or a may subsidiary division or store b is located in the united states  and c had annual gross sales volume or revenues in the prior fiscal year of more than  million  or  iii any business in the united states or another country where may or a may subsidiary or division operates a store or stores in which your duties and functions would be substantially similar to your duties and functions under this agreement and that is in material competition with may or a may subsidiary or division the agreement further provided that either party could seek a judicial determination of its rights under the agreement and that the parties would abide by their obligations under the agreement until the court entered a final judgment in the spring of  vss made weikel an offer to become its chief operating officer weikel considered this a onceinalifetime opportunity after negotiations between his counsel and vss weikel entered into an indemnification agreement with vss but he did not accept the offer of employment or sign an employment agreement the following business day weikel met with his boss drew pickman pickman to tell him of the offer from vss and to seek mays agreement that his acceptance of vsss offer would not violate the terms of the restrictive covenant or any other contractual obligations to may because vss is not a competitor of may weikel requested an immediate response because both he and vss were anxious to begin their relationship weikel pledged to continue to faithfully perform all of his duties under the agreement and offered to assist may with the transition to a new chairman of foleys pickman told weikel that he wanted him to stay and that he would work with the ceo of may to persuade him to stay pickman told weikel that he believed vss was a competitor of may and asked for more time to respond weikel told pickman he needed an answer that day because may would not agree that vss and may are not competitors weikel and vss filed the underlying declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that weikels employment by vss would not violate his agreement with may on june   upon learning of the filing of the declaratory judgment action may terminated weikel from active employment but continued to pay his salary weikel did not begin working for vss and he remained inactive pending the trial courts judgment on november   after each party submitted extensive testimony and numerous exhibits the trial court entered its judgment including findings of fact and conclusions of law the trial court found that vss is an independent subsidiary of limited brands inc and it specializes in the sale of womens intimate apparel vss is a verticallyintegrated specialty retailer that sells only a single brand victorias secret it designs its own lingerie and controls its manufacture and distribution through its own channels vss targets younger women specifically in their midtwenties who are willing to pay higher prices for the victorias secret premium brand vss markets sex appeal for the fashion conscious vss has annual sales of approximately  billion per year may and its divisions including foleys are traditional department stores that sell a broad array of products consisting of hundreds of merchandise categories and thousands of brands intimate apparel constitutes approximately  of mays overall sales mays core customers are women between the ages of  and  years old may is considered a branded business in that it sells products manufactured by others as opposed to a private label business mays biannual market share report which breaks down its market share and apparel store competitors does not mention vss vss customers are item specific and loyal to the victoria secret brand vss has developed a marketing strategy that is branddriven as opposed to pricedriven that strategy is separate and distinct from that used by may or other broadline retailers vss promotes its designer image in contrast mays business focuses on price advantage and does not trade on brand loyalty the trial court further found that vss wanted to hire weikel solely for his personal skills and not for any information or knowledge he has about may it is not interested in information he has about how may conducts its business because its business focus strategy and marketing techniques are not at all similar to mays vss does not competitively shop may or study anything may does in terms of sales products or operations vss finds such information to be counterproductive because may is a traditional or horizontal marketer whose retailing approach is markedly different from vss the trial court found no evidence that weikel had attempted to solicit or contact any other employees or executives of may there was no evidence of specific customer lists or contacts weikel would be able to use if employed by vss and no evidence weikel had divulged any confidential or proprietary information to vss weikel has signed a nondisclosure agreement with vss prohibiting solicitation of may employees or disclosure of any of mays confidential information the trial court found that the restrictive covenant in weikels agreement with may was only triggered if he went to work for a competing business it further found that may and vss do not compete in any material or meaningful way the targeted customer profiles of the two companies are completely different they do not compete for suppliers vendors or other resources vss has its own designs manufactured overseas for exclusive sale in its own stores intimate apparel is the primary product of vss but comprises only about  of mays overall sales may and vss use completely different marketing strategies vss has successfully built its company using a vertically integrated market strategy that is totally different from that used by may any confidential information possessed by weikel is not sought by vss and would not give vss a competitive edge over may the noncompetition provision of the agreement was found not to be per se unreasonable or unenforceable merely inapplicable under the facts and the law in this case because no material competition exists between vss and may although the trial court found no evidence weikel had solicited may employees or misused confidential or trade secret business information from may the provision barring such activity was found to be enforceable for one year pursuant to section  rsmo supp based on these findings the trial court entered judgment in favor of weikel and vss on their claim for declaratory relief and against may on its counterclaim for tortious interference and civil conspiracy may appeals the standard of review is the same for the three points may brings on appeal the judgment of the trial court will be sustained unless there is no substantial evidence to support it unless it is against the weight of the evidence unless it erroneously declares the law or unless it erroneously applies the law murphy v carron  swd   mo banc  the primary rule in the interpretation of a contract is to ascertain the intent of the parties and to give effect to those intentions kling v taylormorley inc  swd   moapp by definition covenants by employees not to compete with their employers after termination of their employment restrain trade in a free market grebing v first natl bank of cape girardeau  swd   moapp covenants not to compete are presumptively void and are enforceable only to the extent they are demonstratively reasonable armstrong v cape girardeau physician assocs  swd   moapp the determination of reasonableness depends upon the competing needs of the parties as well as the needs of the public grebing  swd at  these needs are  the employers need to protect legitimate business interests such as trade secrets and customer lists  the employees need to make a living and  the publics need to secure the employees presence in the labor pool id a restrictive covenant in an employment agreement is only valid and enforceable if it is necessary to protect trade secrets and customer contacts and if it is reasonable as to time and place schmersahl treloar  co pc v mchugh  swd   moapp the burden of demonstrating the covenants validity is on the party seeking to enforce it armstrong  swd at  in its first point may urges that the trial courts finding that vss does not compete with may is against the weight of the evidence and erroneously declares and applies the law in that  the covenant defines competition so as to include vss and its affiliated companies  the evidence overwhelmingly established that both companies sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intimate apparel in many of the same markets at comparable price points  there is a substantial amount of crossshopping by customers and the parties for employees as well as customers and  vss has repeatedly identified department stores as significant competitors and mays intimate apparel department considers vss as among its principal competitors we will briefly examine these contentions in turn mays first contention misstates the findings of the trial court the trial court did not find that vss and may are not competitors it found that there was no meaningful or material competition between may and vss this finding suggests that the trial court was applying definition iii of the term competing business set forth above that definition defines a competing business as one located in the same country as a may store or stores in which weikels duties would be substantially similar to his duties at may and that is in material competition with may or a may subsidiary or division the term material competition is not further defined there is substantial evidence that vss was not a business that was in material competition within the intent of the parties the trial court specifically found that mays biannual market share report which breaks down its market share and apparel store competitors does not mention vss clearly not all businesses that offer the same products broadly defined are necessarily in material competition ritzcarlton and motel  both offer lodging but few would characterize the competition between them as material mortons of chicago and mcdonalds both offer food but it is unlikely that either firm would view the other as a material competitor more importantly it is highly unlikely that an executive moving from any of these firms to the competitor would give the new employer an unfair competitive advantage which is one of the key stated purposes of the agreement at issue in this case the trial court specifically found that any confidential information possessed by weikel would not give vss a competitive advantage over may this finding is supported by substantial evidence may would apply definition i of the term competing business which includes any retailer of goods or merchandise of the type sold by may with a sales volume of  million the difficulty with this contention is that definition iii specifically defines the term as applied to employment in a similar capacity which is the situation presented in this case moreover if literally applied definition i would preclude employment by virtually every nonautomotive or hardware retailer in the united states on this record such a broad prescription would appear to be far broader than necessary to protect may from any unfair competitive advantage we find no error in the trial courts application of the more specific definition found in paragraph iii it is certainly true as may urges that the record establishes that both may and vss sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intimate apparel there was substantial evidence however that they are selling them to essentially different groups of consumers mays evidence with respect to the amount of crossshopping did not establish the percentage of customers who actually made purchases of intimate apparel at both stores and was apparently found unpersuasive by the trial court may also draws our attention to impeachment evidence it offered to establish that while not necessarily mentioning may or its divisions specifically vss has in various court proceedings internal documents and public filings identified department stores as competitors for the sale of intimate apparel the trial court however apparently found vsss witnesses and their explanations of these documents more credible more importantly however the meaning of material competition in the agreement must be based on what the parties to the agreement intended not how vss views the market in sum the trial court found that vss and may are not in material competition for the sale of intimate apparel this determination was made by the trial court after examining evidence presented by both parties and determining the credibility of witnesses before the court the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony is a matter for the trial court in re marriage of crow and gilmore  swd   mo banc  although may points to evidence presented at trial in support of its contentions the trial court may have disregarded all of the evidence favorable to may the trial court is free to believe none part or all of the testimony of witnesses herbert v harl  swd   mo banc  we hold that the trial courts findings are supported by substantial evidence are not against the weight of the evidence and do not erroneously declare or apply the law point denied in its second point may argues the trial court erred in refusing to enforce weikels covenant not to compete because the overwhelming evidence established that weikel had knowledge of and access to numerous types of confidential information concerning mays marketing pricing personnel vendor margins costcontrol efforts staffing inventory expansion plans and other data that are proprietary to may and would be useful to vss and its affiliated companies covenants not to compete are enforceable only to protect against unfair competitive use of either customer contacts or trade secrets armstrong  swd at  the missouri uniform trade secrets act defines a trade secret as a formula pattern compilation program device method technique or process that derives value from not being known and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its use and is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy section  rsmo  the protection does not extend to knowledge that is the natural product of the employment or known throughout the industry but only to trade secrets or influences over customers see renwood food products v schaefer  moapp   swd    there is no dispute that weikel did not have customer contacts which could conceivably give vss an unfair competitive advantage over may may argues that the trial court implicitly found that weikel possessed trade secrets in light of its finding that weikels nondisclosure agreement could be enforced if he misused confidential or trade secret business information we do not view this observation as a finding that weikel has any information which constitutes a may company trade secret the trial court expressly found that any confidential information possessed by weikel would not give vss a competitive advantage over may may produced three witnesses on the subject of confidential information kay piper piper mays vicepresident of the intimate apparel and hosiery department testified with respect to intimate apparel confidential information she identified four may company reports she believed might be valuable to a competitor she had never heard weikels name until the lawsuit was initiated and had no idea whether he had seen any of the reports weikel testified that he spent less than  of his time on intimate apparel matters at foleys concentrating instead on operational matters involving areas such as furniture mattresses cosmetics and shoes he had never reviewed any strategic initiatives regarding intimate apparel at foleys or may kenneth wilkerson wilkerson mays designated corporate representative regarding confidential information other than intimate apparel identified several categories of confidential information to which a chairman at may would have had access these included two sales reports the departmental operating report mays staffing system mays customer service program and human resource information wilkerson had no knowledge that weikel had any of mays confidential information in his possession and weikel testified that he did not weikel has had no ability to access such information since june  there was evidence that the confidential information to which weikel would have had access was not readily susceptible to memorization and had a limited useful life wilkerson conceded that he could not recite the actual sales numbers and figures in the sales report without having the document in front of him the intimate apparel steering committee meets six times per year to generate a business plan setting out the strategic direction for mays sale of intimate apparel those plans are updated and changed every couple of months the confidential reports identified by piper are generated weekly or monthly mays seasonal plans and forecasts discussed at the twiceannual presidents counsel and chairmans roundtable meetings cover a sixmonth period of time sales and other reports are generated weekly or monthly mays merchandising plans are generally for a sixmonth period but they are constantly reviewed and updated based on this evidence the trial court could reasonably have found that while the actual reports themselves would be potentially valuable to a competitor when issued the useful life of the reports is relatively short the fact that piper who is in charge of mays intimate apparel business has a sixmonth noncompetition agreement supports this inference the trial courts finding that any confidential may business information known to weikel would not give vss a competitive advantage over may is supported by substantial evidence point denied mays third proffered witness on the subject of confidential information was john dunham dunham the trial court initially precluded dunham from testifying as to matters designated by may and about which may had previously called wilkerson to testify the trial court did however allow may to proffer dunhams testimony and to file a posttrial memorandum as to the propriety of allowing him to testify on the same subject as the designated corporate representative it its third point may urges that the trial court erred in excluding dunhams testimony although it did listen to dunham testify during the proffer and never explicitly ruled on mays posttrial memorandum we find that dunhams testimony was cumulative and repetitive of wilkersons testimony and assuming it was excluded may was not prejudiced thereby steffen v southwestern bell telephone co  mo   swd    keller v

former employee mark j weikel “weikel” would not be in violation of the noncompetition provisions of his employment contract by accepting a position with victorias secret stores inc “vss”  we affirmweikel was employed by may as chairman of its foleys department store “foleys” division   in  weikel and may entered into an employment agreement “agreement” whereby weikel would render personal services to foleys from may   until april   later extended to april  in the agreement weikel agreed to the following provisionat all times while you are employed by may and for two years after your employment terminates you will not directly or indirectlyi own manage operate finance join control advise consult render services to have an interest or future interest in or participate in the ownership management operation financing or control of or be employed by or connected in any manner with any competing business ․the section of the agreement defining “competing business” provides“competing business” includes but is not limited to i any x retail department store specialty store or other retail business that sells goods or merchandise of the types sold in mays or its subsidiaries or divisions stores at retail to consumers or y any group of such stores or businesses or any other business that a competes for customers suppliers employees or any other resource with may or a may subsidiary division or store  b is located in the united states ․  and c had annual gross sales volume or revenues ․ in the prior fiscal year of more than  million ․  or․iii any business in the united states or another country where may or a may subsidiary or division operates a store or stores in which your duties and functions would be substantially similar to your duties and functions under this agreement and that is in material competition with may or a may subsidiary or divisionthe agreement further provided that either party could seek a judicial determination of its rights under the agreement and that the parties would abide by their obligations under the agreement until the court entered a final judgmentin the spring of  vss made weikel an offer to become its chief operating officer   weikel considered this a onceinalifetime opportunity   after negotiations between his counsel and vss weikel entered into an indemnification agreement with vss but he did not accept the offer of employment or sign an employment agreement   the following business day weikel met with his boss drew pickman “pickman” to tell him of the offer from vss and to seek mays agreement that his acceptance of vsss offer would not violate the terms of the restrictive covenant or any other contractual obligations to may because vss is not a competitor of may   weikel requested an immediate response because both he and vss were anxious to begin their relationship   weikel pledged to continue to faithfully perform all of his duties under the agreement and offered to assist may with the transition to a new chairman of foleyspickman told weikel that he wanted him to stay and that he would work with the ceo of may to persuade him to stay   pickman told weikel that he believed vss was a competitor of may and asked for more time to respond   weikel told pickman he needed an answer that daybecause may would not agree that vss and may are not competitors weikel and vss filed the underlying declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that weikels employment by vss would not violate his agreement with may   on june   upon learning of the filing of the declaratory judgment action may terminated weikel from active employment but continued to pay his salary   weikel did not begin working for vss and he remained inactive pending the trial courts judgmenton november   after each party submitted extensive testimony and numerous exhibits the trial court entered its judgment including findings of fact and conclusions of law   the trial court found that vss is an independent subsidiary of limited brands inc and it specializes in the sale of womens intimate apparel   vss is a verticallyintegrated specialty retailer that sells only a single brand victorias secret   it designs its own lingerie and controls its manufacture and distribution through its own channels   vss targets younger women specifically in their midtwenties who are willing to pay higher prices for the victorias secret premium brand   vss markets sex appeal for the fashion conscious   vss has annual sales of approximately  billion per yearmay and its divisions including foleys are traditional department stores that sell a broad array of products consisting of hundreds of merchandise categories and thousands of brands   intimate apparel constitutes approximately  of mays overall sales   mays core customers are women between the ages of  and  years old   may is considered a branded business in that it sells products manufactured by others as opposed to a private label business   mays biannual market share report which breaks down its market share and apparel store competitors does not mention vssvss customers are “item specific” and loyal to the victoria secret brand   vss has developed a marketing strategy that is branddriven as opposed to pricedriven   that strategy is separate and distinct from that used by may or other broadline retailers   vss promotes its designer image   in contrast mays business focuses on price advantage and does not trade on brand loyaltythe trial court further found that vss wanted to hire weikel solely for his personal skills and not for any information or knowledge he has about may   it is not interested in information he has about how may conducts its business because its business focus strategy and marketing techniques are not at all similar to mays   vss does not competitively shop may or study anything may does in terms of sales products or operations   vss finds such information to be counterproductive because may is a traditional or horizontal marketer whose retailing approach is markedly different from vssthe trial court found no evidence that weikel had attempted to solicit or contact any other employees or executives of may   there was no evidence of specific customer lists or contacts weikel would be able to use if employed by vss and no evidence weikel had divulged any confidential or proprietary information to vss   weikel has signed a nondisclosure agreement with vss prohibiting solicitation of may employees or disclosure of any of mays confidential informationthe trial court found that the restrictive covenant in weikels agreement with may was only triggered if he went to work for a competing business   it further found that may and vss do not compete in any material or meaningful way   the targeted customer profiles of the two companies are completely different   they do not compete for suppliers vendors or other resources   vss has its own designs manufactured overseas for exclusive sale in its own stores   intimate apparel is the primary product of vss but comprises only about  of mays overall salesmay and vss use completely different marketing strategies   vss has successfully built its company using a vertically integrated market strategy that is totally different from that used by may   any confidential information possessed by weikel is not sought by vss and would not give vss a competitive edge over may   the noncompetition provision of the agreement was found not to be per se unreasonable or unenforceable merely inapplicable under the facts and the law in this case because no material competition exists between vss and may   although the trial court found no evidence weikel had solicited may employees or misused confidential or trade secret business information from may the provision barring such activity was found to be enforceable for one year pursuant to section  rsmo supp   based on these findings the trial court entered judgment in favor of weikel and vss on their claim for declaratory relief and against may on its counterclaim for tortious interference and civil conspiracy   may appeals the standard of review is the same for the three points may brings on appeal   the judgment of the trial court will be sustained unless there is no substantial evidence to support it unless it is against the weight of the evidence unless it erroneously declares the law or unless it erroneously applies the law  murphy v carron  swd   mo banc    the primary rule in the interpretation of a contract is to ascertain the intent of the parties and to give effect to those intentions  kling v taylormorley inc  swd   moapp by definition covenants by employees not to compete with their employers after termination of their employment restrain trade in a free market  grebing v first natl bank of cape girardeau  swd   moapp   covenants not to compete are presumptively void and are enforceable only to the extent they are demonstratively reasonable   armstrong v cape girardeau physician assocs  swd   moapp   the determination of reasonableness depends upon the competing needs of the parties as well as the needs of the public  grebing  swd at    these needs are   the employers need to protect legitimate business interests such as trade secrets and customer lists   the employees need to make a living  and  the publics need to secure the employees presence in the labor pool  id  a restrictive covenant in an employment agreement is only valid and enforceable if it is necessary to protect trade secrets and customer contacts and if it is reasonable as to time and place  schmersahl treloar  co pc v mchugh  swd   moapp   the burden of demonstrating the covenants validity is on the party seeking to enforce it  armstrong  swd at  in its first point may urges that the trial courts finding that vss does not compete with may is against the weight of the evidence and erroneously declares and applies the law in that   the covenant defines competition so as to include vss and its affiliated companies   the evidence overwhelmingly established that both companies sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intimate apparel in many of the same markets at comparable price points   there is a substantial amount of crossshopping by customers and the parties for employees as well as customers  and  vss has repeatedly identified department stores as significant competitors and mays intimate apparel department considers vss as among its principal competitors   we will briefly examine these contentions in turnmays first contention misstates the findings of the trial court   the trial court did not find that vss and may are not competitors it found that there was no meaningful or material competition between may and vss   this finding suggests that the trial court was applying definition iii of the term “competing business” set forth above   that definition defines a competing business as one located in the same country as a may store or stores in which weikels duties would be substantially similar to his duties at may and that is in “material competition” with may or a may subsidiary or division   the term “material competition” is not further definedthere is substantial evidence that vss was not a business that was in “material competition” within the intent of the parties   the trial court specifically found that mays biannual market share report which breaks down its market share and apparel store competitors does not mention vss   clearly not all businesses that offer the “same” products broadly defined are necessarily in “material competition”   ritzcarlton and motel  both offer lodging but few would characterize the competition between them as “material”   mortons of chicago and mcdonalds both offer food but it is unlikely that either firm would view the other as a “material” competitor   more importantly it is highly unlikely that an executive moving from any of these firms to the “competitor” would give the new employer an unfair competitive advantage which is one of the key stated purposes of the agreement at issue in this case   the trial court specifically found that any confidential information possessed by weikel would not give vss a competitive advantage over may   this finding is supported by substantial evidencemay would apply definition i of the term “competing business” which includes any retailer of goods or merchandise of the type sold by may with a sales volume of  million   the difficulty with this contention is that definition iii specifically defines the term as applied to employment in a similar capacity which is the situation presented in this case   moreover if literally applied definition i would preclude employment by virtually every nonautomotive or hardware retailer in the united states   on this record such a broad prescription would appear to be far broader than necessary to protect may from any unfair competitive advantage   we find no error in the trial courts application of the more specific definition found in paragraph iiiit is certainly true as may urges that the record establishes that both may and vss sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intimate apparel   there was substantial evidence however that they are selling them to essentially different groups of consumers   mays evidence with respect to the amount of crossshopping did not establish the percentage of customers who actually made purchases of intimate apparel at both stores and was apparently found unpersuasive by the trial courtmay also draws our attention to impeachment evidence it offered to establish that while not necessarily mentioning may or its divisions specifically vss has in various court proceedings internal documents and public filings identified department stores as competitors for the sale of intimate apparel   the trial court however apparently found vsss witnesses and their explanations of these documents more credible   more importantly however the meaning of “material competition” in the agreement must be based on what the parties to the agreement intended not how vss views the market in sum the trial court found that vss and may are not in material competition for the sale of intimate apparel   this determination was made by the trial court after examining evidence presented by both parties and determining the credibility of witnesses before the court   the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony is a matter for the trial court  in re marriage of crow and gilmore  swd   mo banc    although may points to evidence presented at trial in support of its contentions the trial court may have disregarded all of the evidence favorable to may   the trial court is free to believe none part or all of the testimony of witnesses  herbert v harl  swd   mo banc    we hold that the trial courts findings are supported by substantial evidence are not against the weight of the evidence and do not erroneously declare or apply the law   point denied in its second point may argues the trial court erred in refusing to enforce weikels covenant not to compete because the overwhelming evidence established that weikel had knowledge of and access to numerous types of confidential information concerning mays marketing pricing personnel vendor margins costcontrol efforts staffing inventory expansion plans and other data that are proprietary to may and would be useful to vss and its affiliated companies covenants not to compete are enforceable only to protect against unfair competitive use of either customer contacts or trade secrets   armstrong  swd at    the missouri uniform trade secrets act defines a trade secret as “a formula pattern compilation program device method technique or process” that derives value from not being known and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its use and is “the subject of reasonable efforts ․ to maintain its secrecy”  section  rsmo    the protection does not extend to knowledge that is the natural product of the employment or known throughout the industry but only to trade secrets or influences over customers   see renwood food products v schaefer  moapp   swd   there is no dispute that weikel did not have customer contacts which could conceivably give vss an unfair competitive advantage over may   may argues that the trial court “implicitly” found that weikel possessed trade secrets in light of its finding that weikels nondisclosure agreement could be enforced if he misused confidential or trade secret business information   we do not view this observation as a finding that weikel has any information which constitutes a may company trade secret   the trial court expressly found that any confidential information possessed by weikel would not give vss a competitive advantage over maymay produced three witnesses on the subject of confidential information   kay piper “piper” mays vicepresident of the intimate apparel and hosiery department testified with respect to intimate apparel confidential information   she identified four may company reports she believed might be valuable to a competitor   she had never heard weikels name until the lawsuit was initiated and had no idea whether he had seen any of the reports   weikel testified that he spent less than  of his time on intimate apparel matters at foleys concentrating instead on operational matters involving areas such as furniture mattresses cosmetics and shoes   he had never reviewed any strategic initiatives regarding intimate apparel at foleys or maykenneth wilkerson “wilkerson” mays designated corporate representative regarding confidential information other than intimate apparel identified several categories of confidential information to which a chairman at may would have had access   these included two sales reports the departmental operating report mays staffing system mays customer service program and human resource information   wilkerson had no knowledge that weikel had any of mays confidential information in his possession and weikel testified that he did not   weikel has had no ability to access such information since june there was evidence that the confidential information to which weikel would have had access was not readily susceptible to memorization and had a limited useful life   wilkerson conceded that he could not recite the actual sales numbers and figures in the sales report without having the document in front of him   the intimate apparel steering committee meets six times per year to generate a business plan setting out the strategic direction for mays sale of intimate apparel   those plans are updated and changed every couple of months   the confidential reports identified by piper are generated weekly or monthly   mays seasonal plans and forecasts discussed at the twiceannual presidents counsel and chairmans roundtable meetings cover a sixmonth period of time   sales and other reports are generated weekly or monthly   mays merchandising plans are generally for a sixmonth period but they are constantly reviewed and updated   based on this evidence the trial court could reasonably have found that while the actual reports themselves would be potentially valuable to a competitor when issued the useful life of the reports is relatively short   the fact that piper who is in charge of mays intimate apparel business has a sixmonth noncompetition agreement supports this inference   the trial courts finding that any confidential may business information known to weikel would not give vss a competitive advantage over may is supported by substantial evidence   point denied mays third proffered witness on the subject of confidential information was john dunham “dunham”   the trial court initially precluded dunham from testifying as to matters designated by may and about which may had previously called wilkerson to testify   the trial court did however allow may to proffer dunhams testimony and to file a posttrial memorandum as to the propriety of allowing him to testify on the same subject as the designated corporate representative   it its third point may urges that the trial court erred in excluding dunhams testimony although it did listen to dunham testify during the proffer and never explicitly ruled on mays posttrial memorandum   we find that dunhams testimony was cumulative and repetitive of wilkersons testimony and assuming it was excluded may was not prejudiced thereby  steffen v southwestern bell telephone co  mo   swd     keller v intl harvester corp  swd   moapp   point deniedthe

terms of the restrictive covenant or any other contractual obligations to may because vss is not a competitor of may weikel requested an immediate response because both he and vss were anxious to begin their relationship weikel pledged to continue to faithfully perform all of his duties under the agreement and offered to assist may with the transition to a new chairman of foleys pickman told weikel that he wanted him to stay and that he would work with the ceo of may to persuade him to stay pickman told weikel that he believed vss was a competitor of may and asked for more time to respond weikel told pickman he needed an answer that day because may would not agree that vss and may are not competitors weikel and vss filed the underlying declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that weikels employment by vss would not violate his agreement with may on june   upon learning of the filing of the declaratory judgment action may terminated weikel from active employment but continued to pay his salary weikel did not begin working for vss and he remained inactive pending the trial courts judgment on november   after each party submitted extensive testimony and numerous exhibits the trial court entered its judgment including findings of fact and conclusions of law the trial court found that vss is an independent subsidiary of limited brands inc and it specializes in the sale of womens intimate apparel vss is a verticallyintegrated specialty retailer that sells only a single brand victorias secret it designs its own lingerie and controls its manufacture and distribution through its own channels vss targets younger women specifically in their midtwenties who are willing to pay higher prices for the victorias secret premium brand vss markets sex appeal for the fashion conscious vss has annual sales of approximately  billion per year may and its divisions including foleys are traditional department stores that sell a broad array of products consisting of hundreds of merchandise categories and thousands of brands intimate apparel constitutes approximately  of mays overall sales mays core customers are women between the ages of  and  years old may is considered a branded business in that it sells products manufactured by others as opposed to a private label business mays biannual market share report which breaks down its market share and apparel store competitors does not mention vss vss customers are item specific and loyal to the victoria secret brand vss has developed a marketing strategy that is branddriven as opposed to pricedriven that strategy is separate and distinct from that used by may or other broadline retailers vss promotes its designer image in contrast mays business focuses on price advantage and does not trade on brand loyalty the trial court further found that vss wanted to hire weikel solely for his personal skills and not for any information or knowledge he has about may it is not interested in information he has about how may conducts its business because its business focus strategy and marketing techniques are not at all similar to mays vss does not competitively shop may or study anything may does in terms of sales products or operations vss finds such information to be counterproductive because may is a traditional or horizontal marketer whose retailing approach is markedly different from vss the trial court found no evidence that weikel had attempted to solicit or contact any other employees or executives of may there was no evidence of specific customer lists or contacts weikel would be able to use if employed by vss and no evidence weikel had divulged any confidential or proprietary information to vss weikel has signed a nondisclosure agreement with vss prohibiting solicitation of may employees or disclosure of any of mays confidential information the trial court found that the restrictive covenant in weikels agreement with may was only triggered if he went to work for a competing business it further found that may and vss do not compete in any material or meaningful way the targeted customer profiles of the two companies are completely different they do not compete for suppliers vendors or other resources vss has its own designs manufactured overseas for exclusive sale in its own stores intimate apparel is the primary product of vss but comprises only about  of mays overall sales may and vss use completely different marketing strategies vss has successfully built its company using a vertically integrated market strategy that is totally different from that used by may any confidential information possessed by weikel is not sought by vss and would not give vss a competitive edge over may the noncompetition provision of the agreement was found not to be per se unreasonable or unenforceable merely inapplicable under the facts and the law in this case because no material competition exists between vss and may although the trial court found no evidence weikel had solicited may employees or misused confidential or trade secret business information from may the provision barring such activity was found to be enforceable for one year pursuant to section  rsmo supp  based on these findings the trial court entered judgment in favor of weikel and vss on their claim for declaratory relief and against may on its counterclaim for tortious interference and civil conspiracy may appeals the standard of review is the same for the three points may brings on appeal the judgment of the trial court will be sustained unless there is no substantial evidence to support it unless it is against the weight of the evidence unless it erroneously declares the law or unless it erroneously applies the law murphy v carron  swd   mo banc  the primary rule in the interpretation of a contract is to ascertain the intent of the parties and to give effect to those intentions kling v taylormorley inc  swd   mo app  by definition covenants by employees not to compete with their employers after termination of their employment restrain trade in a free market grebing v first natl bank of cape girardeau  swd   mo app  covenants not to compete are presumptively void and are enforceable only to the extent they are demonstratively reasonable armstrong v cape girardeau physician assocs  swd   mo app  the determination of reasonableness depends upon the competing needs of the parties as well as the needs of the public grebing  swd at  these needs are  the employers need to protect legitimate business interests such as trade secrets and customer lists  the employees need to make a living and  the publics need to secure the employees presence in the labor pool id a restrictive covenant in an employment agreement is only valid and enforceable if it is necessary to protect trade secrets and customer contacts and if it is reasonable as to time and place schmersahl treloar  co pc v mchugh  swd   mo app  the burden of demonstrating the covenants validity is on the party seeking to enforce it armstrong  swd at  in its first point may urges that the trial courts finding that vss does not compete with may is against the weight of the evidence and erroneously declares and applies the law in that  the covenant defines competition so as to include vss and its affiliated companies  the evidence overwhelmingly established that both companies sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intimate apparel in many of the same markets at comparable price points  there is a substantial amount of crossshopping by customers and the parties for employees as well as customers and  vss has repeatedly identified department stores as significant competitors and mays intimate apparel department considers vss as among its principal competitors we will briefly examine these contentions in turn mays first contention misstates the findings of the trial court the trial court did not find that vss and may are not competitors it found that there was no meaningful or material competition between may and vss this finding suggests that the trial court was applying definition iii of the term competing business set forth above that definition defines a competing business as one located in the same country as a may store or stores in which weikels duties would be substantially similar to his duties at may and that is in material competition with may or a may subsidiary or division the term material competition is not further defined there is substantial evidence that vss was not a business that was in material competition within the intent of the parties the trial court specifically found that mays biannual market share report which breaks down its market share and apparel store competitors does not mention vss clearly not all businesses that offer the same products broadly defined are necessarily in material competition ritzcarlton and motel  both offer lodging but few would characterize the competition between them as material mortons of chicago and mcdonalds both offer food but it is unlikely that either firm would view the other as a material competitor more importantly it is highly unlikely that an executive moving from any of these firms to the competitor would give the new employer an unfair competitive advantage which is one of the key stated purposes of the agreement at issue in this case the trial court specifically found that any confidential information possessed by weikel would not give vss a competitive advantage over may this finding is supported by substantial evidence may would apply definition i of the term competing business which includes any retailer of goods or merchandise of the type sold by may with a sales volume of  million the difficulty with this contention is that definition iii specifically defines the term as applied to employment in a similar capacity which is the situation presented in this case moreover if literally applied definition i would preclude employment by virtually every nonautomotive or hardware retailer in the united states on this record such a broad prescription would appear to be far broader than necessary to protect may from any unfair competitive advantage we find no error in the trial courts application of the more specific definition found in paragraph iii it is certainly true as may urges that the record establishes that both may and vss sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intimate apparel there was substantial evidence however that they are selling them to essentially different groups of consumers mays evidence with respect to the amount of crossshopping did not establish the percentage of customers who actually made purchases of intimate apparel at both stores and was apparently found unpersuasive by the trial court may also draws our attention to impeachment evidence it offered to establish that while not necessarily mentioning may or its divisions specifically vss has in various court proceedings internal documents and public filings identified department stores as competitors for the sale of intimate apparel the trial court however apparently found vsss witnesses and their explanations of these documents more credible more importantly however the meaning of material competition in the agreement must be based on what the parties to the agreement intended not how vss views the market in sum the trial court found that vss and may are not in material competition for the sale of intimate apparel this determination was made by the trial court after examining evidence presented by both parties and determining the credibility of witnesses before the court the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony is a matter for the trial court in re marriage of crow and gilmore  swd   mo banc  although may points to evidence presented at trial in support of its contentions the trial court may have disregarded all of the evidence favorable to may the trial court is free to believe none part or all of the testimony of witnesses herbert v harl  swd   mo banc  we hold that the trial courts findings are supported by substantial evidence are not against the weight of the evidence and do not erroneously declare or apply the law point denied in its second point may argues the trial court erred in refusing to enforce weikels covenant not to compete because the overwhelming evidence established that weikel had knowledge of and access to numerous types of confidential information concerning mays marketing pricing personnel vendor margins costcontrol efforts staffing inventory expansion plans and other data that are proprietary to may and would be useful to vss and its affiliated companies covenants not to compete are enforceable only to protect against unfair competitive use of either customer contacts or trade secrets armstrong  swd at  the missouri uniform trade secrets act defines a trade secret as a formula pattern compilation program device method technique or process that derives value from not being known and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its use and is the subject of reasonable efforts    to maintain its secrecy section  rsmo  the protection does not extend to knowledge that is the natural product of the employment or known throughout the industry but only to trade secrets or influences over customers see renwood food products v schaefer  swd   mo app  there is no dispute that weikel did not have customer contacts which could conceivably give vss an unfair competitive advantage over may may argues that the trial court implicitly found that weikel possessed trade secrets in light of its finding that weikels nondisclosure agreement could be enforced if he misused confidential or trade secret business information we do not view this observation as a finding that weikel has any information which constitutes a may company trade secret the trial court expressly found that any confidential information possessed by weikel would not give vss a competitive advantage over may may produced three witnesses on the subject of confidential information kay piper piper mays vicepresident of the intimate apparel and hosiery department testified with respect to intimate apparel confidential information she identified four may company reports she believed might be valuable to a competitor she had never heard weikels name until the lawsuit was initiated and had no idea whether he had seen any of the reports weikel testified that he spent less than  of his time on intimate apparel matters at foleys concentrating instead on operational matters involving areas such as furniture mattresses cosmetics and shoes he had never reviewed any strategic initiatives regarding intimate apparel at foleys or may kenneth wilkerson wilkerson mays designated corporate representative regarding confidential information other than intimate apparel identified several categories of confidential information to which a chairman at may would have had access these included two sales reports the departmental operating report mays staffing system mays customer service program and human resource information wilkerson had no knowledge that weikel had any of mays confidential information in his possession and weikel testified that he did not weikel has had no ability to access such information since june  there was evidence that the confidential information to which weikel would have had access was not readily susceptible to memorization and had a limited useful life wilkerson conceded that he could not recite the actual sales numbers and figures in the sales report without having the document in front of him the intimate apparel steering committee meets six times per year to generate a business plan setting out the strategic direction for mays sale of intimate apparel those plans are updated and changed every couple of months the confidential reports identified by piper are generated weekly or monthly mays seasonal plans and forecasts discussed at the twiceannual presidents counsel and chairmans roundtable meetings cover a sixmonth period of time sales and other reports are generated weekly or monthly mays merchandising plans are generally for a sixmonth period but they are constantly reviewed and updated based on this evidence the trial court could reasonably have found that while the actual reports themselves would be potentially valuable to a competitor when issued the useful life of the reports is relatively short the fact that piper who is in charge of mays intimate apparel business has a sixmonth noncompetition agreement supports this inference the trial courts finding that any confidential may business information known to weikel would not give vss a competitive advantage over may is supported by substantial evidence point denied mays third proffered witness on the subject of confidential information was john dunham dunham the trial court initially precluded dunham from testifying as to matters designated by may and about which may had previously called wilkerson to testify the trial court did however allow may to proffer dunhams testimony and to file a posttrial memorandum as to the propriety of allowing him to testify on the same subject as the designated corporate representative it its third point may urges that the trial court erred in excluding dunhams testimony although it did listen to dunham testify during the proffer and never explicitly ruled on mays posttrial memorandum we find that dunhams testimony was cumulative and repetitive of wilkersons testimony and assuming it was excluded may was not prejudiced thereby steffen v southwestern
