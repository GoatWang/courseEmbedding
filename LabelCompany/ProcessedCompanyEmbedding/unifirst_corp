memphis tn in march interviewthe interview process was as i had read a bit more cumbersome than one would expect there was an initial interview with both the sales manager and branch manager together then a followup during which i had to give a presentation on material i was given to test my stage presence and comprehension ability following that there were two phone interviews one of which was much more in depth quite enjoyable actually before i was done with the process and received an offer none of the interviews were onerous few of the questions were redundant and i was able to get a very good feel for the people for whom i would be working during the process so i knew it would be a good fit from my perspective my interviewers knew that i was interviewing them too and were very forthcoming in offering information and explaining how thing actually worked in the real world versus just giving me an idealized picture that was all rosy i accepted the position because i liked what i heard and now that i am into the rather extensive training i am eager to start sellinginterview questions how will i adapt to a sales position that is out of the office   answer question unifirst
