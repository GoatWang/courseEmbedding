pollution prevention plan and why is it needed what is an swppp and why is it neededa swppp is a storm water pollution prevention plan in most states it must be developed prior to any ground breaking activity and is required for both development and residential construction stages swppps are often required for permitting and the noi notice of intent many organizations have applied for permits without a swppp under the notion that the few paragraphs under the erosion plan on the construction plans will suffice when signing the notice of intent noi one is acknowledging creation of a swppp in states that require one swppps contains information on among other items vegetation hazardous materials endangered species best management practices bmp historical data intended sequence of events spill prevention program and wetlands the swppp shall be amended whenever there is change in design construction operation or maintenance which has a significant effect on the potential for discharge of pollutants to surface waters of the state or a ms municipal separate storm sewer systemthe swppps are kept on the job site to be referenced and amended as needed by the storm water professional inspector associated with weekly inspections classification changes and rain events what is cesswicesswi certified erosion sediment and storm water inspector is a recognized specialist in soil erosion and sediment control cesswis have educational training demonstrated expertise experience in controlling erosion and sedimentation and meet certification standards what is an noinota few preventative and proactive steps go a long way in protecting our water and our clients a noi is a notice of intent and is basically the permit application required for npdesgenerally a noi will suffice for the life of the project if for example a builder both develops land and also constructs homes it may be advisable for a builderdeveloper to create separate nois or copermittee agreements if for example they are only developing property or only constructing homes recall that the noi usually requires that a swppp be created a permit be filed and compliance with the permit be enacted this includes inspections and use of bmps alpha emc prepares packets for our clients for nois and nots to assist in filing the not is the notice of termination signifying that the construction activity is completed it illustrates the permittee has achieved final stabilization on all portions of responsible work a not is also advisable when a new operator has assumed control on all areas of the site an example as mentioned earlier would include the development of property that is sold to another group that will perform home construction only the new operator would then apply for their own noi what are the risks involved with noncomplianceseveral entities are involved with compliance and enforcement they include the epa state regulators and water management districtsfailure to comply may bring about warnings reminders and penalties in fact the epa may apply penalties up to  per violation per day with potential for retroactive applicationmost penalties will not be that significant however that does not diminish the reality of noncompliance increasingly companies are working through noncompliance issues that not only include the encumbrance of penalties but the cost of time and effort of internal and third partiesnoncompliance may come in several forms ie failure to apply for permit failure to comply with permit instructions failure to conduct weekly inspections with reports lack of bmps and improper use of bmps etcit is not uncommon for alpha environmental management corporation to speak to parties whom feel no risk or may be indifferent only to receive a call weeks later hearing of a noncompliance issue what is npdesnational pollutant discharge elimination systempolluted stormwater runoff is a leading cause of impairment to the nearly  percent of surveyed us water bodies which do not meet water quality standards over land or via storm sewer systems polluted runoff is discharged often untreated directly into local water bodies when left uncontrolled this water pollution can result in the destruction of fish wildlife and aquatic life habitats a loss in aesthetic value and threats to public health due to contaminated food drinking water supplies and recreational waterwaysmandated by congress under the clean water act the npdes storm water program is a comprehensive twophased national program for addressing the nonagricultural sources of storm water discharges which adversely affect the quality of our nations waters the program uses the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permitting mechanism to require the implementation of controls designed to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed by storm water runoff into local water bodies are inspections requireddepending on your state inspections are usually required once every seven days and within twenty four hours of a rainfall greater than  inches in a twenty four hour period blue sky to blue skythe inspection requires several points to be monitored recorded and logged as well as attached to the swppp where requireda common error in inspections is leaving the work to noncertified or nonspecialized entities that are not completely fulfilling all aspect of the inspections this includes frequency process reporting and necessary followupwith well over several dozen items that must be evaluated inspections are a critical component to the builder which places a greater need for the appropriate personnel to support such measures what are bmpsbmps are best management practices they include schedule of activities prohibition of practices maintenance procedures and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants to us waters bmps also include treatment requirements operating procedures and practice to control plant site runoff spillage or leaks sludge or waste disposal or drainage from raw material storagebmps are required to be identified in the swppp when your state requires a swppp examples include silt fencing vegetative strips hydroseeding mulching etcwhere do we go from herethe days of indifference and lack of enforcement have come to an end most companies realize this when they find themselves in

plan and why is it needed what is an swppp and why is it neededa swppp is a storm water pollution prevention plan in most states it must be developed prior to any ground breaking activity and is required for both development and residential construction stages swppps are often required for permitting and the noi notice of intent many organizations have applied for permits without a swppp under the notion that the few paragraphs under the erosion plan on the construction plans will suffice when signing the notice of intent noi one is acknowledging creation of a swppp in states that require one swppps contains information on among other items vegetation hazardous materials endangered species best management practices bmp historical data intended sequence of events spill prevention program and wetlands the swppp shall be amended whenever there is change in design construction operation or maintenance which has a significant effect on the potential for discharge of pollutants to surface waters of the state or a ms municipal separate storm sewer systemthe swppps are kept on the job site to be referenced and amended as needed by the storm water professional inspector associated with weekly inspections classification changes and rain events what is cesswicesswi certified erosion sediment and storm water inspector is a recognized specialist in soil erosion and sediment control cesswis have educational training demonstrated expertise experience in controlling erosion and sedimentation and meet certification standards what is an noinota few preventative and proactive steps go a long way in protecting our water and our clients a noi is a notice of intent and is basically the permit application required for npdesgenerally a noi will suffice for the life of the project if for example a builder both develops land and also constructs homes it may be advisable for a builderdeveloper to create separate nois or copermittee agreements if for example they are only developing property or only constructing homes recall that the noi usually requires that a swppp be created a permit be filed and compliance with the permit be enacted this includes inspections and use of bmps alpha emc prepares packets for our clients for nois and nots to assist in filing the not is the notice of termination signifying that the construction activity is completed it illustrates the permittee has achieved final stabilization on all portions of responsible work a not is also advisable when a new operator has assumed control on all areas of the site an example as mentioned earlier would include the development of property that is sold to another group that will perform home construction only the new operator would then apply for their own noi what are the risks involved with noncomplianceseveral entities are involved with compliance and enforcement they include the epa state regulators and water management districtsfailure to comply may bring about warnings reminders and penalties in fact the epa may apply penalties up to  per violation per day with potential for retroactive applicationmost penalties will not be that significant however that does not diminish the reality of noncompliance increasingly companies are working through noncompliance issues that not only include the encumbrance of penalties but the cost of time and effort of internal and third partiesnoncompliance may come in several forms ie failure to apply for permit failure to comply with permit instructions failure to conduct weekly inspections with reports lack of bmps and improper use of bmps etcit is not uncommon for alpha environmental management corporation to speak to parties whom feel no risk or may be indifferent only to receive a call weeks later hearing of a noncompliance issue what is npdesnational pollutant discharge elimination systempolluted stormwater runoff is a leading cause of impairment to the nearly  percent of surveyed us water bodies which do not meet water quality standards over land or via storm sewer systems polluted runoff is discharged often untreated directly into local water bodies when left uncontrolled this water pollution can result in the destruction of fish wildlife and aquatic life habitats a loss in aesthetic value and threats to public health due to contaminated food drinking water supplies and recreational waterwaysmandated by congress under the clean water act the npdes storm water program is a comprehensive twophased national program for addressing the nonagricultural sources of storm water discharges which adversely affect the quality of our nations waters the program uses the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permitting mechanism to require the implementation of controls designed to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed by storm water runoff into local water bodies are inspections requireddepending on your state inspections are usually required once every seven days and within twenty four hours of a rainfall greater than  inches in a twenty four hour period blue sky to blue skythe inspection requires several points to be monitored recorded and logged as well as attached to the swppp where requireda common error in inspections is leaving the work to noncertified or nonspecialized entities that are not completely fulfilling all aspect of the inspections this includes frequency process reporting and necessary followupwith well over several dozen items that must be evaluated inspections are a critical component to the builder which places a greater need for the appropriate personnel to support such measures what are bmpsbmps are best management practices they include schedule of activities prohibition of practices maintenance procedures and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants to us waters bmps also include treatment requirements operating procedures and practice to control plant site runoff spillage or leaks sludge or waste disposal or drainage from raw material storagebmps are required to be identified in the swppp when your state requires a swppp examples include silt fencing vegetative strips hydroseeding mulching etcwhere do we go from herethe days of indifference and lack of enforcement have come to an end most companies realize this when they find themselves in noncompliance others have heard the news and are actively working to create programswhen considering the scope of the situation we believe there is an opportunity to maximize effectiveness with minimal strain the facets of the process include nois swppps inspections nots bmps compliance agency interaction education program audits consultation and proper reporting just to name a fewthis is
