new tube transport system upon which many novel industry applications can be enabled and deployed we are a privately held company and have funded years of rd through private investment joint ventures strategic relationships and industry and government grants andor loans we have been fortunate to develop a substantial patent portfolio in the process whooshh is a dynamic company located in bellevue wa usa it was founded on the belief that there need to be more efficient ways to move delicate objects perishable fruit and proteins and live fish from one point to another regardless of the height to be lifted or the weight of the object to be transported the result is an object transport system that allows you to transform many of your operations and challenges many of your assumptions company

london shortly after thomas edison and nicholas tesla two great innovators battled in the war of currents between alternating current ac and direct current dc culminating in the first major ac hydroelectric plant at niagara falls in new york  years later in  elon musk has made headlines with his electric cars and his ideas of a hyperloop transport system what happened in between henry ford popularized the automobile interstate hiways were built boeing commercialized the airplane and to move information better the internet and the information superhighway was conceived transporting stuff efficiently is really important as is the clean energy to power the movement of things more efficientlywell known products for transporting people processed foods and information have been critical to our economic growth worldwide yet surprisingly industry has not much advanced the state of the art of moving live andor highly perishable product over short distances from point a to point b much is still done by hand and that which is not is often done in bulk relegating industries such as food no  and energy no  the two largest industries in the world to antiquated and inefficient processeswhooshh transport systems cost effectively reinvent the way we move certain objects particularly when live or fresh and by doing so provides a platform for new applications and solutions that will decrease waste improve yield and quality and enable use of our natural resources for their most productive uses all while decreasing the environmental footprint apple changed the world when they

positive roi in two years time or less – and in many cases much less with whoosh transport set a new higher standard for quality yield and productivity you cant afford not to adopt regardless of your previous capital investmentshygienicwhooshh systems are made with durable fda approved materials capable of withstanding all standard cleaning agents including sodium hypochlorite sodium hydroxide hydrogen peroxide bleach chorine uv ozone and boiling water cip adaptation possible standard cleaning time for entire system is approximately  minutes easily cleaned pumphouses contain the only movable parts – no removing conveyor belts or other large components an added advantage over all other transport systems is the ability to completely dry the transport sleeve thereby reducing the chance of bacterial growthin comparison conveyor belts systems are large and cumbersome and hard to clean in many cases it is not possible to thoroughly clean a conveyor because of the very large total surface area of the structure and many hidden surfaces the result of the conveyor design is that plant and vessel operators must use considerable time and resources labor and material cleaning the systems – up to  of the processing plant time is used for cleaning every dayhispeedeach system is capable of handling the capacity of todays processing machinery the product is being transported to – eg slaughter machine of  salmon per minute heading machine  salmon per minute filleting machine  salmon per minute optimize the processing line by incorporating our transport systems to avoid buffers such as holding tanks up to  salmon per minute in each transport tube systems that transport larger numbers of smaller fish per minute are also availablegentle  dryin contrast to either conveyor belts or aqua pumps the whooshh transport system relies upon the creation of a seal around the fish and the introduction of a pressure differential which provides the motive force to the fish movement in particular the whooshh system provides for a soft flexible sleeve that accommodates and gently and continuously engages the surface of the fish the whooshh system does not move a column of water it is for practical purposes a dry system because the whooshh system relies almost entirely upon air only a mist is introduced for lubricity to create the pressure differential the mode of force movement requires much less pressure and energy than traditional aqua pump systems the whooshh system is designed to provide transport of delicate objects like fresh fruit and live fish over distance without damage bruising or stress flexible  verticaltransport along ceilings is easily accomplished take advantage of the “cheap real estate”overhead for the transport of products our transport systems are not constrained by traditional height limitations of fixedinplace conveyor belts in processing plants and can be more easily moved or reconfigured  no other transport method can provide the flexibility ease of installation and transport efficiency as our whooshh transport systems customizable site specific flexible configurations available systems are easily installed and capable of transporting product up and over of other processing machinery more about fish handling system economics we will work with you to help you determine the roi of whooshh transport within your operations

fish species are affected by the development and operation of dams dams without adequate fish passage systems block migrating up stream adults from reaching critical habitat for downstream juveniles a substantial proportion can be killed while migrating through dams both directly through collisions with structures and abrupt pressure changes during passage through turbines and spillways and indirectlythrough nonfatal injury and disorientation dams also cause increased travel times for juveniles to migrate downstream due to disruption of natural flowing rivers this increase travel time andor migration delaypresents an array of potential survival hazards including increased exposure to predation and disease depleting energy reserves and potentially causing metabolic problems associated with smoltification most popular related searches eel ladder fish migration barrier weir engineering weir dam the effects of dams and other barriers on fish and the effects of dams and other barriers on fish and wildlife are unquestionably great along the west coast of the us there are currently 7 different endangered species act listed endangered andor threatened species in the columbiasnake and willamette river basins alone there are  endangered andor threatened species of migratory salmon   dams among other factors have been one of the leading causes of disruption of returning salmon to their native habitat and disruption of migrating juveniles to the ocean leading to severe declines in runs and even extinction of species   currently upstream adult passage is wellknown in the united states and europe   these systems include fish ladders fish lifts locks and trap  haul programs that capture and truck fish past barriers for release back instream  the problem is that even though upstream passage systems are wellknown they do not exist on a majority of dams or provide passage around other barriers and they tend to be very costly   additionally what is not well developed anywhere in the country are upstream solutions that focus on more than the few actual species that passage systems are built to address  on the west coast of the united states the vast majority of upstream passage is focused on returning salmon species  there are limited passage systems for other species like the pacific lamprey and none for sturgeon bull trout steelhead returning downstream or any of the other multiple native regional species   these same issues persist on the east coast of the us as well with species such as the american eel american shadnative herring and
