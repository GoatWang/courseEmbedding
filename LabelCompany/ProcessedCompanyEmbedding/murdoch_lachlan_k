hollywood reporter rainer hosch james and lachlan murdoch in first interview atop fox politics roger ailes dad and plans for the future exclusive the brothers who took over the st century fox empire july  sit down together and open up about whos in charge sister liz the new age of television and whether their rebellious spirit can create the next great media era this story first appeared in the oct  issue of the hollywood reporter magazine to receive the magazine click here to subscribe its oct  a scorching hot afternoon on the fox studios lot in los angeles and its been less than  hours since rupert murdoch made news by tweeting about republican presidental candidate ben carson what about a real black president who can properly address the racial divide and much else the comment is being dissected interpreted and mocked on television and online just like nearly every move made by the legendary yearold media mogul but perhaps no murdoch machination has been more analyzed than his plan to elevate his family members to succeed him atop st century fox the television and film behemoth that includes the fox network cable channels fox news fx and nat geo fox sports a share of the sky pay tv services throughout europe and thriving film and tv studios here in la that family drama came to a head in june when murdoch announced that james murdoch  the youngest of his four grown children would become ceo of the company and lachlan murdoch  would become executive chairman a title rupert also would retain news corp the company that murdoch built from a single australian newspaper into a global power until he split it in  after fallout from the phonehacking scandal at his uk newspapers now houses such publishing assets as the wall street journal and new york post and is managed separately with the bro­thers on the board today on the fifth floor of building  on the lot with fox news and nat geo both playing on wallhung tvs the next generation of murdochs enters an executive conference room this is james and lachlans first sitdown interview together since news of their ascension leaked in a classic murdochian drama with rival cnbc first reporting the transition followed by a fox business network anchor declaring that fox news longtime leader roger ailes who has said he doesnt have much of a relationship with the younger murdochs would continue to report to rupert a claim that would soon be refuted in an official st century fox statement the legion of murdochologists in the media then piled on with analyses and king lear analogies detailing the rivalries and supposed power struggles that led to this new regime you dont want to get into a position where youre obsessing over what people are saying — is this fair is that unfair etc — because people are going to write what they are going to write says james of the coverage the key for us and for me personally is just focus on the job focus on trying to make the right decisions and over time your track record bears itself out but speculation comes with the family name for the murdochs whose fox empire generated  billion in revenue in fiscal  and  billion in profit its stock was down about  percent on oct  since the brothers took over july  amid a broad media selloff this summer due to cordcutting fears foxs film studio — home to avatar xmen and current hit the martian and now run by jim gianopulos — has a legacy that dates to the origin of hollywood william fox and the zanuck family and its television operation — run by peter rice with fox sports run by eric shanks empire from fox television group run by dana walden and gary newman fargo fx networks run by john landgraf and ailes fox news whose aug  republican debate was watched by  million viewers — dates to when rupert in characteristically ballsy fashion launched a fourth broadcast net­work in  james and lachlan say they share their fathers appetite for strategic risktaking and the faded arm tattoos visible when they roll up their sleeves are further evidence of a rebel streak that both brothers have displayed in the past lachlan left the company in  and returned to australia for a decade james in his youth quit harvard dyed his hair and started a hiphop label he also stepped down as chairman of news international in  amid the hacking scandal at the nowshuttered news of the world but now as the new murdoch era begins james his wife kathryn and their three children are based in new york and lachlan and wife sarah recently moved to las mandeville canyon with their three kids the bicoastal brothers say they are ready to face significant challenges together as st century fox charts a course in a dramatically shifting environment the potential is there as the sons have good energy and probably a better understanding of changing media consumption habits says analyst steve birenberg of northlake capital management in an hourlong qa with the hollywood reporter edited excerpts of which are below no question is offlimits from plans for their first big moves to their relationships with their father sister liz ailes and perhaps most important each other its a new way of working together admits james but as partners so far so good james and lachlan murdoch were photographed oct  on the fox lot in los angeles   neither of you is on social media right lachlan correct james not in a public way youll never be able to find me laughs but your father is and he makes news as he did recently with his ben carson tweet what do you think of that james look its a personal platform for him that he values in terms of being able to communicate and i try not to get involved it goes to a larger point so much of this company has been associated with your dad and his politics are you political lachlan first of all i disagree with some of the premise of the question in that while externally people have combined the company with our fathers personal opinions which are super interesting or his politics theyre actually not always the same we have a huge number of creators in this business on this lot a huge number of journalists and editors around the world who have nothing to do with his politics or his thoughts they make entirely their own decisions your father once said he felt like an outsider in hollywood do you feel that way james no nor does one necessarily need to be an insider everywhere its not a distinction that i think about whether its in hollywood in new york london australia wherever weve always felt very comfortable in the entertainment business lachlan frankly in the last decade our fathers spent a lot of time here he owned a home in beverly hills and in  he bought the acre moraga vineyards winery and estate in bel air for  million im not sure he would say that again i think what is intended in that quote also is a matter of where you get your taste from and it is important in hollywood and the media to make sure where you get your creative taste and how you think about what audiences will like is not defined by a few square blocks around pico boulevard but actually whats out there in the real world what are your own personal tastes james for me pretty populist i guess i love empire i love unbreakable kimmy schmidt i loved the martian i loved the grand budapest hotel — i love everything wes anderson makes i loved american hustle last year im super excited were making joy with hustle director david o russell i watch exotic european sports so we dont have to talk about that — bike racing and automotive sports lachlan the other thing which is true for james as well because we both have young kids its great because you start to see a whole lot of stuff that we would never get to watch you see a lot of stuff frankly that the kids are watching online and its great to see another way the whole ecosystems changing james im an expert in the clone wars but it breaks my heart fox released the first six star wars films before disney purchased lucasfilm in  we talk now more than ever — multiple times a day usually says lachlan of his relationship with brother james   disney has made amazing strides by picking off smaller fiefdoms is that a strategy you think fox can employ lachlan disney has had a great strategy but it works perfectly for them with the brand extensions and theme parks youve got to give them full marks for that for us wed be opportunistic but not at the same level as disneys been james while our focus is on franchise pictures and franchises are super super important … one of the things im most proud of is the creative diversity of the film slate and the television production slate from homeland to modern family to american horror story to the grand budapest hotel to the martian to he named me malala to xmen and ice age and alvin and the chipmunks god help me its just … that diversity is really exciting because we want to be a place where someone can say they have a great idea be it an original concept like kingsman or a new franchise or superhero movie we want them to be able to say im not afraid to bring that to fox in some ways you need to be a little careful with the street saying these are sure things because its just franchise franchise franchise you have to be willing to take creative risks on storytelling the martian its great storytelling youre running this company together but james youre the ceo and that carries with it certain and separate responsibilities right james yeah but my brothers executive chairman and we do this together my father is executive chairman hes still involved and is doing great how involved specifically is your father now lachlan hes still the boss right his position really hasnt changed we have our father and we have our board and ultimately the shareholders whats happened is a generational transition to new management and thats very important but its been very seamless and hes still there guarding the company every day why was the decision made for james to be ceo lachlan it really wasnt an issue for us we thought it made sense functionally everyone reports to both of us equally we make the decisions together whose idea was it for lachlan to be in los angeles the arrangement seems to model how your dad was mostly in new york and coo chase carey was in la james its different look chase is a great partner and friend and colleague but its different in that lachlan and i are actually partners and equal shareholders in the business and are equals even though we partner probably in a similar way in terms of the way they worked together it seemed to make sense to do it this way as a founder and entrepreneur he will continue to be involved in this business that he’s created says james right of father rupert who retains an executive chairman title and still speaks regularly to his sons lachlan you resisted playing a major role in the company for a while lachlan i wouldnt say i resisted the company i wanted to go do my own thing i went back to australia for  years built a very successful business that was terrific he founded private investment firm illyria pty ltd and built nova entertainment into a top australian radio network but the whole time i remained on the board of news corp — and after they split news corp and fox in a  interview your father said lachlan did not like or have a happy experience in hollywood true lachlan i dont think thats true honestly it was a point in my life where it was important to go and do my own thing and take a big risk — which i think is important sometimes — and i did and it worked out really well its one of the very best decisions i ever made in my life leaving the company and id do it again james well hopefully you wont do it again laughs lachlan its actually led me to be an even better executive for that experience some say you two dont get along and theres bickering during board meetings true james no not true actually i dont think we bicker lachlan i dont think we ever disagree oh please youre brothers james from a strategy point of view on the boardlevel stuff i dont think lachlan and i have ever had any major — or really any minor — disagreements with respect to where the direction of the business needs to be and how we prosecute that but were brothers we used to fight like cats in a bag but you know we were young then laughs lachlan i always won which was good james im not so sure lachlan i was bigger back then james yeah exactly not anymore rupert with from left children lachlan james and elisabeth and thenwife anna in  your father was willing to bet the company several times by buying the studio or starting the fox network do you share that same risk tolerance james its one of the great qualities of the culture of this company that it can take risks — creative risks business risks it can do things that other observers might think are impossible or are not going to work from the fox network to fox news to star tv to sky to sky deutschland and so on lachlan we have to take risks right but thats not to say were going to bet the whole company even after the financial crisis in   when news corp nearly crumbled under massive debt i think even our father says hes not going to take that size of a risk again and the company now has a scale where you dont have to put yourself in a position where youre betting the whole company but you are going to take a series of carefully thought out but aggressive creative and strategic risks like what have you identified some initial bets or initiatives james lachlan and i are pretty clear on strategy and i think over the next year or two years youll see a record of moving the company forward at a pretty high velocity how james laughs well have to wait and see lachlan the changing dynamics of the media industry as a whole are pretty obvious we are develop­ing strategies to deal with those obvious changes lets talk about those changes international tv is seen as a growth area and most believe youre going to finally buy the rest of sky that you dont already own james the sky businesses weve only just brought them all together into one big european platform sky plc that integration is going really well the company is moving at a very fast pace and has grown in value enormously weve also been clear that over time having  percent of an unconsolidated asset is not an end state that is natural for us right now were  percent focused on supporting the company to get this integration going and get it done for the business to move forward so there are no plans on the agenda right now james and wife kathryn who married in  how about time warner when fox made its  billion offer time warner ceo jeff bewkes told his shareholders that the bid was too low and he was going to raise the stock price would you approach him again lachlan weve moved on from time warner there was a point in time when it was a great opportunity frankly for both sets of shareholders but weve moved on does it worry you that viacom or cbs postsumner redstone could merge with time warner james were much more focused on operating st century fox were less focused on whatever the daily scuttlebutt is around ma for example with our new partnership with national geographic on the nat geo cable channel … we have a broader relationship with the national geographic society now and we think theres huge opportunities to grow the business … to really navigate through what is increasingly clear is an exciting new business in streaming television we look at the digital television consumption were seeing around these brands its growing fast and at a scale already lachlan its sort of morbid and somewhat distasteful that theres this general whispering of what happens at viacom or cbs in the future for us thats not something we want to engage in click image to enlarge true but a giant asset could become available soon james maybe maybe not i dont know their mind or whats going on over there speaking of streaming james you suggested recently that tv will move further from an adsupported model to more subscription how fast do you see that trajectory and how long will the tv ad model in its current form last james well i think what i said is well continue to have a variety of models — some dual models with advertising — but the traditional conception of advertising as an interruptive format that is sort of scattershot is something that needs to evolve were already seeing that in a digitalstreaming envi­ronment where we can create new ad products that are less interruptive have lighter ad loads that create a better product experience for customers lachlan and more engagement for their clients james the advertising business could be very strong but the current interruptive model of advertising of cueing things up down the line and interrupting the programming for    minutes is something that probably wont be tolerable for customers thats not to say that i think everything is going to subscription i think youre still going to see a mixed model but a lot needs to be done many executives need to show more leadership in pushing forward on ad innovation and particularly around premium quality video advertising which is still an incredibly impactful medium for marketers lachlan and wife sarah who married in  what does this mean for the future of the fox broadcast network james first and foremost the job at hand at the fox network that dana walden gary newman and peter rice and the whole team are focused on is how do we make it excellent in terms of putting great programming in front of viewers were very excited about the start of the new season through three weeks fox is down  percent in adults to to an average  rating this season — but it is down the least of the big four networks but broadcast seems to be a diminishing model do you disagree james what im trying to say is i think the health of the fox network depends on the quality of the programming and were really doing stuff creatively that works the model around it will evolve and we have to have an appetite for that change too often in the industry we focus on the existing or past business rules and not on the product itself and new business rules and opportunities that are going to emerge from that lachlan if you look at the quality content we have now — you can take empire as an example but you can take a bunch of other examples as well the linear broadcast distribution or consumption of that show is absolutely changing whether its timeshifting people watching on fox now or watching on hulu theyre doing that across these different platforms to james point on advertising all these different new technologies metrics and methods are developing as we speak in real time and its important that we stay on top of each one of those changes because the number of people watching the hit shows is huge but we have to reach each one of them and monetize it american idol is ending this season will there ever be another show outside of sports that can generate  million viewers an episode james in the live window i would never say never but i would echo what lachlan said were already seeing in a show like empire or scream queens that the initial broadcast is a fraction of the total viewership were still seeing a high volume of viewers coming to the pilot episode of scream queens on hulu fox now and others if you add up all of that over the first  days which were not quite at the end of yet its a big big show advertisers dont necessarily agree though james i think theyre starting to when news broke of your new roles st century fox had to put out a statement saying roger ailes will report to you two how is your relationship with ailes now lachlan its good we both talk to him all the time the business hes built and the channels hes built are terrific we have a huge regard for him and hes done a great job james and lachlan murdoch but roger told thr earlier this year that nobody knows whats going to happen to him or to fox news once rupert retires lachlan ruperts never retiring laughs but its no secret that ailes relationship is with rupert hes said he doesnt really know you guys james we have a good relationship with roger and its been a long one listen fox news is an incredible franchise we think theyre doing a great job can you commit right now to keeping roger as long as he wants to stay james i wouldnt get into discussing with you frankly any future issues around what somebody might or might not want to do not what he wants to do what you want to do … james certainly from my perspective he just signed a new contract and were really pleased with that and we hope he stays for as long as he wants lachlan hes done a great job when you see donald trump feuding with fox news do you get involved lachlan well always support our editors and news producers and certainly our journalists if someone wants to have a feud with any of them not just donald trump well always support our really hardworking and decent journalists part of our job is to protect them james the strongest thought that i had when i saw the beginning of that trumps attacks following the fox newshosted gop debate was just how awesome megyn kelly was lachlan yeah she was great a lot of people are wondering what your politics are james i can speak for myself — my politics are a private matter ive never spoken about them publicly i have some things i get involved in james cofounded quadrivium a foundation that supports natural resources science civic life childhood health and equal opportunity but ultimately my job and our job here is about being able to maintain create and grow a platform that has a diversity of voices james on a panel at the cannes lions international festival of creativity on june  has spoken at several conferences this year the family trust that owns  percent of the companys voting shares is said to have four votes the two of you your sister elisabeth and your other sister prudence — and apparently there is no tiebreaker how is that going to work james look first of all the structure of how the family governs the trust etc is something for the family to worry about but were all very aligned about things going forward nothings going to change there for many years so its not something that we worry about that much does it bother you that your sister liz is not involved in running the company james it was definitely a regret when she decided to leave her production company shine after coming into the business when news corp bought it in  for  million which we had been really excited about but she made a choice to go do some new projects and shes got a bunch of stuff shes doing philanthropically and entrepreneurially and is very happy doing those things she decided for herself that that was the right thing for her to do and were very supportive of that were a close family but shes doing other things now it seems like a lot of your focus is on tv how involved do you guys expect to be at the film studio lachlan its not our job to be greenlighting films thats for the professionals across the road in the film executive building but were going to be driving them as hard as were going to be driving the rest of our businesses james its an industry thats changing quickly … we have to change the way we think about how we window movies we have to change the way we license programming to third parties or to ourselves theres a lot of facets of what we have to do in this business but theres no one piece of it that were more or less involved in the business is the business your father recently helped bring stacey snider to the studio are you comfortable making those kinds of moves on the film side lachlan sure james yeah absolutely we have to make the decisions that we have to make lachlan and we do every day how much rope are you willing to give james cameron on the very expensive avatar sequels the first of three was slated for  and now its not coming for at least a year later james it goes without saying jim is just an incredible filmmaker i know jim gianopulos and everyone at the studio wants him to be able to create something he feels is right unlimited budget james i didnt say that laughs former news of the world editor rebekah brooks with rupert murdoch in  was brought back to news corp as ceo of news uk in september fox always has moved aggressively in sports fox sports  by a lot of measures has been a successful launch but the ratings arent huge james theyre higher than espns this summer for the world cup james and some other events and baseball playoffs have been great are you committed to spending the astronomical fees it takes to put the kinds of sports on that make a difference lachlan were best when we build businesses when were the underdog and when were competing against an entrenched player thats much bigger — and you can see that in fox sports — so absolutely were absolutely committed to continuing to grow it and thats going to be our main continued investment james that doesnt mean that any price is the right price and we have been very comfortable walking away from opportunities i think with fox sports  were really happy with the packages we have theres baseball nascar ufc golf its a very very strong lineup you combine the fox sports brand with the broadcast network sports the nfl world series baseball the fs platform with everything i just mentioned and then some regional nets under the fox sports brand with the yankees and the mets or st louis with the cardinals etc these are things that really drive an enormous amount of viewership the murdochs attended the allen  co media conference in sun valley idaho in  espn has been under scrutiny from disney and is facing layoffs and some say the costs the network has incurred and the high subscriber fees actually could come back to bite disney as we move to an ott world james yeah but i think you have to make a distinction between an incumbent network that is fully distributed and has been without serious competition for decades and a startup thats a year and a half old were very happy to just take market share lachlan when we launched fox news in  james and i were much younger but i do remember the conversations around it a lot of people internally in the company said why would you launch a news service when theres cnn its the same thing with espn james how involved were you in bringing rebekah brooks the indicted but acquitted former editor of news of the world back to the company james well rebekah has gone back to news corp as ceo of news uk im a nonexecutive director there so i wasnt very involved what was the biggest thing you learned from the hacking scandal james every professional experience you learn a lot from you learn about yourself you learn about the company you learn about peoples interests around the place in a situation like that you learn a lot about politics it was a very intense period but you know what doesnt kill you makes you stronger james you quit harvard dyed your hair different colors got some piercings founded a rap label does any of that rebel remain james one hundred and fifty percent of it laughs the nice thing about middle age is that you still think to yourself pathetically that youre still that guy lachlan why do you assume he doesnt have any piercings main image rainer hosch comments comments powered by disqus murdochs warn that delaying sky deal would hurt uk post brexit  bloomberg murdochs warn that delaying sky deal would hurt uk post brexit by joe mayes joemayes more stories by joe mayes july    am edt fox executives say waiting will ‘inevitably’ defer investment ey analyst fox ‘a hostage to the macro political climate’ liberium says foxsky deal will go through eventually rupert murdoch’s st century fox inc warned that any delay in approving its  billion pound  billion acquisition of sky plc would slow investment and signal to other companies that the uk wasn’t “open for business” as the country leaves the european unionfox raised the concerns in a letter to culture minister karen bradley who will ultimately decide whether to approve the deal uniting the murdochs’ transatlantic media empire a spokesman for bradley who is under political pressure to stop the deal said last week that she doesn’t plan to take the next step in the process before parliament goes on summer break thursday  potentially pushing a final decision to march rupert and lachlan murdochphotographer david paul morrisbloomberg“our proposed transaction will be carefully scrutinized by others keen to gauge the government’s commitment to creating a climate conducive to investment” fox cochairman lachlan murdoch and chief executive officer james murdoch said in the july  letter they warned that investment decisions will “inevitably need to be deferred” as the regulatory process dragged on the letter raises the political stakes for a conservative government that was weakened in a general election in june the party which took a tough line on immigration at the expense of business priorities in its initial stance toward brexit negotiations is now trying to woo leaders from commerce as it tries to firm its threadbare hold on power prime minister theresa may will launch a new business advisory group on thursday to help mend fences the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up fox’s new tone also illustrates just how quickly the script has changed for fox since december when the murdochs proposed buying the  percent of sky not already owned on a conference call then lachlan murdoch predicted a smooth path toward approval by the end of  with no meaningful concessions but the disruptive uk general election a drumbeat of sexual and racial harassment allegations at fox’s us networks and pushback from regulators have slowed the deal’s progressnow the company faces expensive delays and opponents are making an allout effort to stop the transaction bradley a conservative party politician could later face a judicial challenge from deal opponents if she moves forward without fully weighing the mountain of feedback she received ahead of a deadline last friday“fox has become a hostage to the macro political situation” said martyn whistler global media  entertainment analyst at ey in london “the general election weakened the incumbents and emboldened the opposition to such an extent that they’re in a better position to challenge any decision”any slowdown would cost fox money  sky is on the hook to pay a  millionpound dividend to shareholders if the deal doesn’t close by yearend if it fails altogether fox must pay sky  million pounds in a separate letter this week lawyers for fox  the owner of fox news fx and the th century fox film studio  asked bradley make a quick decision on whether to refer the takeover to the competition  markets authority for an indepth review that could last up to six monthsfox’s lawyers are also trying to discourage bradley from backtracking on her preliminary decision in june to restrict any further cma’s investigation to examining the murdochs’ increased market power in uk media opponents are trying to reopen another line of inquiry which would allow for the family’s corporategovernance failings to be reexploredthat would open the door for opponents to dredge up the voicemail hacking that doomed a previous attempt to buy sky in  and evidence from lawsuits and investigations in the us related to harassment allegations at fox news and fox business“the government have to be seen to be whiter than white” whistler said

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
