including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in developing markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and can reduce returns because the fund may invest its assets in companies in a specific region including europe it is subject to greater risks of adverse developments in that region andor the surrounding regions than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically current political and financial uncertainty surrounding the european union may increase market volatility and the economic risk of investing in companies in europe derivatives including currency management strategies involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses as well as enable gains on an amount that exceeds the funds initial investment the fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised the funds risk considerations are discussed in the prospectus performance data represents past performance which does not guarantee future results current performance may differ from figures shown investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions and you may have a

bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration average effective duration between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those at  or greater of the mcbi

with at least a year history morningstar calculates a morningstar rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure against other funds in the same category this measure takes into account variations in a funds monthly performance and does not take into account the effects of sales charges placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the weights are  year rating for  months of total returns  year rating year rating for  months of total returns and  year rating year rating year rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods morningstar rating™ is for the named

risk considerations the fund may not achieve its objective andor you could lose money on your investment in the fund investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer borrower counterparty or other entity responsible for payment underlying collateral or changes in economic political issuerspecific or other conditions certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile in addition debt instruments entail interest rate risk as interest rates rise prices usually fall therefore the funds share price may decline during rising rates funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations at times and particularly during periods of market turmoil all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market as a result it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price the price of an instrument trading at a negative interest rate responds to interest rate changes like other debt instruments however an instrument purchased at a negative interest rate is expected to produce a negative return if held to maturity investments in foreign markets can involve greater risk and volatility than us investments because of adverse market currency economic industry political regulatory geopolitical or other conditions emerging markets can have less market structure depth and regulatory custodial or operational oversight and greater political social and economic instability than developed markets investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions be highly volatile involve leverage which can magnify losses and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicators on which the derivative is based such as counterparty and liquidity risk investments in below investment grade quality debt instruments can be more volatile and have greater risk of default or already be in default than higherquality debt instruments please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations product insights  capital gains estimates november     dividend and capital gain schedule  dividend and capital gain schedule  morningstar ratings see the results of our collaborative approach for mfs “all star” portfolios  definitions average effective duration average effective duration is a measure of how much a bond’s price is likely to fluctuate with general changes in interest rates eg if rates rise  a bond with a year duration is likely to lose about  of its value average effective maturity average effective maturity is a weighted average of maturity of the bonds held in a portfolio taking into account any prepayments puts and adjustable coupons which may shorten the maturity longermaturity funds are generally considered more interestrate sensitive than shorter maturity funds morningstar disclosure the morningstar rating for funds or star rating is calculated for funds with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods morningstar rankings may vary
