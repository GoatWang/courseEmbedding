construction  frequently asked questions  faq faac specific q why does one gate leaf run slower than the other a the operator might need to be bled remember to remove the vent screw and run the operator electronically a couple of times also make sure the potentiometers are set to their appropriate settings and that the torque is set to the maximum setting for hydraulics lastly check the oil level and make sure it�s at the proper operating level as explained in the installation manual q why won�t my operator run at all a make sure that the correct circuits are closed this entails possibly adding jumper circuits check your manual for correct placement also for existing installations be sure to check your fuses and led q how do i know if my pressures are correct a remember that hydraulic pressures are not set at the factory the pressures must be set so that if the gate meets an obstacle it will bypass at  pounds of pressure this may seem right for your installation but the pressures still need to be checked and adjusted for your particular application   copyright �  open sesame inc all rights reserved other trademarks are copyright by their respective owners hosting design and
