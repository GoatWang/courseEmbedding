goal primarily through investment in a diversified portfolio of equity securities of companies with small market capitalizations under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its net assets in domestic common stocks and other equity securities including convertible preferred stocks and warrants of smallcapitalization companies consistent with companies within the russell ® value index   the fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a diversified portfolio of smallcapitalization securities selling at discounts to their fair value as assessed by the investment and research team of phocas financial corporation “phocas” the fund’s subadviser  phocas will typically invest in  to  companies with initial weightings between  to  of the fund’s total assets in order to

expenses must be considered carefully before investing the prospectus contains this and other important information about the frontier funds and it may be obtained by downloading or calling  to download select the prospectus option located on the right sidebar mutual fund investing involves risk principal loss is possible principal risk factors the main risks of investing in the fund are market risks the fund’s investments are subject to market risk which may cause the value of the fund’s investments to decline if the value of the fund’s investments goes down you may lose money the share price of the fund is expected to fluctuate your shares at redemption may be worth less than your initial investment us and international markets have experienced extreme volatility reduced liquidity credit downgrades increased likelihood of default and valuation difficulties in recent years stock selection risks the stocks selected for the fund may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising small capitalization risks the fund will invest primarily in securities of companies with small market capitalizations which are often more volatile and less liquid than investments in larger companies the frequency and volume of trading in securities of small capitalization companies may be substantially less than is typical of larger companies therefore the securities of small capitalization companies may be subject to greater and more abrupt price fluctuations than larger companies in addition small capitalization companies may lack the management experience financial resources and product diversification of larger companies making them more susceptible to market pressures generally the smaller the company size the greater these risks equity security risks the fund invests primarily in common stocks and other equity securities common stocks and other equity securities generally increase or decrease in value based on the earnings of a company and on general industry and market conditions a fund that invests a significant amount of its assets in common stocks and other equity securities is likely to have greater fluctuations in share price than a fund that invests a significant portion of its assets in fixed income securities value investing risks the fund invests in primarily valuestyle stocks stocks whose prices the portfolio manager believes are undervalued in relation to fundamental measures value stocks may never increase in price or pay dividends as anticipated by the portfolio manager or may decline even further if the market fails to recognize the company’s value if the factors that the portfolio manager believes will increase the price do not occur or if a stock judged to be undervalued is actually appropriately priced management risk the fund is subject to management risk as an activelymanaged investment portfolio  sector risks  although phocas selects stocks based on their individual merits some economic sectors will represent a larger portion of the funds overall investment portfolio than other sectors  potential negative market or economic developments affecting one of the larger sectors could have a greater impact on the fund than on a fund with fewer holdings in that sector  given the current composition of the russell ®  value index the fund may invest a relatively large percentage of its assets in the financial sector and therefore the funds performance may be adversely affected by volatility in financial and credit markets  financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation interest rate risk credit losses and price competition among other factors high portfolio turnover risks  during the initial period of phocas management of the fund the fund may experience a high portfolio turnover rate over   high portfolio turnover is likely to lead to increased fund expenses such as brokerage commissions and other transaction costs  additionally a high portfolio turnover rate may result in higher shortterm capital gains taxable to shareholders and in lower investment returns   the frontier funds are not offered

sometimes called the multiple pe gives investors an idea of how much they are paying for a company’s earning power the higher the pe the more investors are paying and therefore the more earnings growth they are expecting earnings per share eps growth is the weighted average of earnings per share growth for all securities in the portfolio projected for the past five fiscal years earnings per share for a company is defined as total earnings divided by shares outstanding market capitalization is the total dollar market value of all of a companys outstanding shares turnover is sourced from the funds current prospectus the index data displayed under allocations are calculated using msim and other thirdparty methodologies and may differ from data published by the vendor forecast and estimates are subject to change and may not necessarily come to pass due to changing market andor economic conditions  riskreturn definitions alpha is the excess return or value added positive or negative of the portfolio’s return relative to the return of the benchmark beta is a measure of the relative volatility of a security or portfolio to the markets upward or downward movements a beta greater than  identifies an issue or fund that will move more than the market while a beta less than  identifies an issue or fund that will move less than the market the beta of the market is always equal to  information ratio is the portfolio’s alpha or excess return per unit of risk as measured by tracking error versus the portfolio’s benchmark r squared measures how well an investment’s returns correlate to an index an r squared of  means the portfolio performance is  correlated to the index’s whereas a low rsquared means that the portfolio performance is less correlated to the index’s sharpe ratio is a riskadjusted measure calculated as the ratio of excess return to standard deviation the sharpe ratio determines reward per unit of risk the higher the sharpe ratio the better the historical riskadjusted performance standard deviationmeasures how widely individual performance returns within a performance series are dispersed from the average or mean value tracking error is the amount by which the performance of the portfolio differs from that of the benchmark upsidedownside market capture measures performance in up down markets relative to the market benchmark risk considerations there is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks in general equities securities’values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic market and liquidity risks the risks of investing in frontier emerging markets are greater than risks associated with investments in other foreign or us issuers and they are often considered highly speculative in nature investment opportunities in many frontier emerging markets may be concentrated in the banking industry which could have a disproportionate impact on the portfolio’s performance stocks of small and medium capitalization companies entail special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies by investing in investment company securities the portfolio is subject to the underlying risks of that investment companys portfolio securities in addition to the portfolios fees and expenses the portfolio generally would bear its share of the investment companys fees and expenses derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance they also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities liquidity risk morningstar rankings the percentile rankings are based on the average annual total returns for the periods stated and do

website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i
