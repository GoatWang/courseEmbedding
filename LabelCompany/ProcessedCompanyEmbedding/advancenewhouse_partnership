of appeals is considered and it is denied because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court markman j dissenting i respectfully dissent from this court’s order denying leave to appeal because the issues raised here are in my judgment of considerable constitutional significance as to matters affecting the tax policy and procedures the fiscal and business environments and the jurisprudence of this state i believe they ought to be heard by the highest court of this state and would thus grant leave to appeal in  michigan joined the multistate tax compact the compact when the legislature enacted mcl  see  pa  effective july   article iii of the compact provided that certain multistate taxpayers may elect to apportion income to michigan for tax purposes “in the manner provided by the laws of such state” ie the laws of michigan or else “in accordance with article iv” mcl  art iii article iv provided for an apportionment formula based on property payroll and sales factors mcl  art iv effective january   the legislature enacted the michigan business tax act bta mcl  et seq  pa  which provided that “each tax base established under this act shall be apportioned in accordance with this chapter” mcl  finally mcl  of the bta provided for an apportionment formula based solely on a sales factor at issue in ibm v dep’t of treasury  mich   was whether the plaintiff multistate taxpayer could elect to use the compact’s threefactor apportionment formula for its  michigan taxes or whether as the defendant department of treasury argued it was required to use the bta’s salesfactoronly apportionment formula this court ruled in ibm that the taxpayer could elect to use the compact’s apportionment formula the lead opinion stated that “the legislature had not repealed the compact’s election provision by implication when it enacted the bta” id at  opinion by viviano j while the concurring opinion left that question open id at  zahra j concurring in response the legislature enacted  pa  which repealed the compact “retroactively and effective beginning january  ”  pa  enacting §  as a consequence  pa  retroactively repealed the compact election provision beginning that date as well several multistate taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of  pa  but the court of claims and the court of appeals  upheld the statute against those challenges gillette commercial operations north america  subsidiaries v dep’t of treasury  mich app    in my judgment the following four constitutional questions that are raised in the taxpayers’ various applications for leave to appeal warrant thorough consideration by this court by a grant of leave to appeal first is  pa  consistent with federal dueprocess protections us const ams v and xiv given that the retroactivity period here of six years and nine months arguably exceeds “a modest period of retroactivity” united states v carlton  us    and that one justice has observed in this same regard in a frequently cited statement that “a period of retroactivity longer than the year preceding the legislative session in which the law was enacted would raise    serious constitutional questions” id at  o’connor j concurring in the judgment second is  pa  consistent with the michigan due process clause const  art  §  when that clause is worded differently than the federal due process clause and we have held that the state provision may afford heightened protections delta charter twp v dinolfo  mich   n   because “while the federal supreme court is the final judge of violations of the federal constitution the decision of the supreme court of this state is final on the question of whether or not a state statute conflicts with the state constitution” people v victor  mich    third does  pa  violate either the federal or state prohibitions against the impairment of contracts us const art i §  cl  const  art  §  because the compact is a reciprocal and binding interstate compact between the signatory states with respect to which a retroactive withdrawal from the compact amounts to an unconstitutional impairment of that contract see gillette co v franchise tax bd  cal th    fourth does  pa  violate the separation of powers clause const  art  §  because by prescribing the outcomes of those cases that were held in abeyance pending ibm as well as ibm itself the legislature has impinged on the judicial power const  art  §  and contravened the principle that “the legislature cannot dictate to the courts what their judgments shall be or set aside or alter such judgments after they  have been rendered” people ex rel sutherland v governor  mich    cf plaut v spendthrift farm inc  us    “congress has exceeded its authority by requiring the federal courts to exercise ‘the judicial power of the united states’ u s const art iii §  in a manner repugnant to the text structure and traditions of article iii” as the united states supreme court has recognized “the power to tax involves the power to destroy” m‘culloch v maryland  us  wheat    this power must be kept subject to proper constitutional limits particularly when as here a heightened tax burden has been imposed not on future business activities but on business activities planned and undertaken many years ago while i do not yet have any firm belief regarding the constitutionality of  pa  i do have a firm belief that before retroactive tax burdens such as those set forth in this law are imposed the arguments of affected taxpayers deserve consideration by the highest court of this state accordingly i respectfully dissent and would grant leave to appeal viviano j joins the statement of markman j i larry s royster clerk of the michigan supreme court certify
