zacks investment research shares of arch capital have underperformed the zacks categorized property and casualty industry quarter to date the company witnessed its  estimates moving south over the last  days exposure to catastrophe losses poses an inherent risk to the pc business inducing volatility in underwriting results also a still low interest rate environment and intense competition raise concerns for the company nonetheless with a strong product portfolio arch capital has been maintaining an exemplary track record of premium growth this apart the company has been making efforts to diversify its mortgage insurance business through strategic acquisitions moreover the insurer remains focused in boosting shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend payments such effective capital deployment makes the stock an attractive pick for yieldseeking investors   wells fargo  company analysts commented we await more details from the company to determine whether this will potentially lead to additional reserve charges across the industry   bmo capital markets analysts commented we are incorporating a  embedded value into our acgl valuation stemming from the future earnout of already written mortgage insurance business in addition we expect the incorporation of the ugc book to lower the overall earnings volatility of arch as a majority of earnings over the next  months will come from already written mortgage insurance while arch was never known for volatility the reduced pmls and mortgage insurance earnout should stabilize it even further justifying an increased valuation   goldman sachs group inc the analysts commented management is willing to ramp up its subscale mortgage operations faster than previously expected with the acquisition of american international group inc nyse aigs united guaranty operationsthe brokerage noted that the acquisition shows the willingness of the company to deploy significant capital to scale its mortgage insurance business faster than it could do so organicallyour analysis implies that arch could see approximately – percent of eps accretion which could increase arch roes by approximately bps to bps all else

appears to be more willing to bypass organic growth via the usage of marelated link stocks affected by hurricane seasongiven market conditions and returns in mi are much more attractive than pc more broadly on a proforma basis a potentially scaled up mi platform could have a significant impact on earnings nannizzi highlightednannizzi also raised his price target to  from  equivalent to x qe book
