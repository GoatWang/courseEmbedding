the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously expected factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance

grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  the same as at securitization when the herf falls below  moodys uses the excelbased large loan model and then reconciles and weights the results from the conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation the large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loanlevel proceeds derived from moodys loanlevel ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage loan structure and property type moodys also further adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated with loan level

collateralized by  fixedrate loans secured by  properties the ratings are based on the collateral and the structure of the transaction moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio the moodys actual dscr of x x excluding structured credit assessed

age quality of construction location market and tenancy the weighted average moodys quality grade for the pool is  which is on par with most recently rated pools and is an indication that the real

level diversity and property level diversity when selecting a ratings approach with respect to loan level diversity the pools loan level herfindahl score is   excluding structured credit assessed

herfindahl score is slightly lower at   excluding structured credit assessed loans with respect to property level diversity the pools property level herfindahl score is   excluding structured credit assessed loans which is significantly lower than the q average of  the pool contains five loans  of the pool balance that are secured by multiple properties loans secured by multiple properties benefit from lower cash flow volatility given that excess cash flow from one property can be used to augment anothers cash flow to meet debt service requirements these loans also benefit from the pooling of equity from each underlying property the principal methodology used in these ratings was approach to rating us and canadian conduit fusion cmbs published in december  please see the ratings methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys analysis also uses the cmbs io calculator which references the following inputs to calculate the proposed io rating based on the published methodology original and current bond ratings and credit assessments original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the ios references within the transaction and io type corresponding to an io type as defined in the published methodology moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated aaa sf super senior classes would be aaa aa and aa respectively for the aa sf rated class as the ratings would be aa a and baa respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into

loans secured by  properties the ratings are based on the collateral and the structure of the transaction moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio the moodys actual dscr of x x excluding structured credit assessed loans is higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x the moodys stressed dscr of x x excluding structured credit assessed loans is slightly higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x the trust loan balance of  million represents a moodys ltv ratio of  which is lower than the  conduitfusion transaction average of  excluding one loan with assigned structured credit assessments the trust loan balance of  million represents a moodys ltv ratio of  when including subordinate debt the moodys ltv ratio is  excluding the one loan with assigned structured credit assessments the moodys ltv ratio including subordinate debt is  the pooled trust benefits from having one loan totaling  million or  of the pool balance which is assigned an investment grade structured credit assessment moodys assigned a structured credit assessment of aaa scapd to the glp industrial portfolio b loan which is secured by  crosscollateralized industrial properties located across  states and  different markets with a total of approximately  million sf loans assigned investmentgrade structured credit assessments are not expected to contribute any loss to a transaction in low stress scenarios but are expected to contribute minimal amounts of losses in high stress scenarios moodys also considers the creditworthiness of loans when considering the effects of loan pooling the power of diversity is inversely correlated with credit quality as such structured credit assessments assigned an opinion of aaa scapd do not impact a pools diversity profile when the assessments raise or lower the herfindahl score moodys also grades properties on a scale of  to  best to worst and considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment the factors considered include property age quality of construction location market and tenancy the weighted average moodys quality grade for the pool is  which is on par with most recently rated pools and is an indication that the real estate quality of the underlying assets is average relative to the cmbs  universe typical moodys rated conduit pools during  year to date exhibit an average grade of  moodys also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity when selecting a ratings approach with respect to loan level diversity the pools loan level herfindahl score is   excluding structured credit assessed loans which is below the scores calculated for most multiborrower pools that moodys has rated since  accounting for loans made to a common borrower represented in the pool moodys borrower level herfindahl score is slightly lower at   excluding structured credit assessed loans with respect to property level diversity the pools property level herfindahl score is   excluding structured credit assessed loans which is significantly lower than the q average of  the pool contains five loans  of the pool balance that are secured by multiple properties loans secured by multiple properties benefit from lower cash flow volatility given that excess cash flow from one property can be used to augment anothers cash flow to meet debt service requirements these loans also benefit from the pooling of equity from each underlying property the principal methodology used in these ratings was approach to rating us and canadian conduitfusion cmbs published in december  please see the ratings methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys analysis also uses the cmbs io calculator which references the following inputs to calculate the proposed io rating based on the published methodology original and current bond ratings and credit assessments original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the ios references within the transaction and io type corresponding to an io type as defined in the published methodology moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated p aaa sf super senior classes would be aaa aa and aa respectively for the p aa sf rated class as the ratings would be aa a and baa respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into

dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger

overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially
