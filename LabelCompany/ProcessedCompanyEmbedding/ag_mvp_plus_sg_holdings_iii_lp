amended complaint the ac seq  defendant wells fargo bank national association wells fargo or the trustee separately moves to dismiss the ac on grounds substantially similar to those raised by the funds seq  plaintiff commonwealth advisors inc commonwealth opposes the motions for the reasons that follow the motions are granted in part and denied in part  by order dated november   dkt  the court granted the funds unopposed motion for leave to intervene which was supporteq with a proposed pleading bearing the caption appearing at the top of this decision see dkt  below the clerk is directed to amend the caption accordingly and the funds are directed to serve and file their proposed answer in intervention which contains crossclaims and counterclaims see id at  references to dkt followed by a number refer to documents filed in this action on the new york state courts electronic filing system nyscef  of  filed new york county clerk   pm  nyscef doc no  i index no  received nyscef  factual background  procedural history as this is a motion to dismiss the facts recited are taken from the ac see okt  and the documentary evidence submitted by the parties commonwealth is the collateral manager for defendant collybus coo i ltd collybus or the issuer  a special purpose vehicle incorporated in the cayman islands that issued a collateralized debt obligation the cd  a collateral management agreement the cma dkt  governs commonwealths role as collateral manager and an indenture the indenture dkt  governs the rights of the holders of the notes issued by the c  both agreements are dated as of november   and are governed by new york law wells fargo is the indenture  collybus has not appeared in this action  the court assumes familiarity with the structure of cdos and the role of a coo collateral manager suffice it to say that a collateral manager has contractual and fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the coo subject here to certain fiduciary duty waivers see okt  at  that generally require the collateral manager to put the interests of the coo ahead of its own see eg id at  the collateral manager shall cause any purchase or sale of any collateral debt security or eligible investment to be conducted on arms length terms in accordance with reasonable and customary business practices and in compliance with applicable laws and in the case of any purchase or sale between the issuer and the collateral manager any affiliate thereof any accounts managed by the collateral manager andor its affiliates such purchases or sales are made on a basis no less favorable taken as a whole than would be obtained in a similar transaction with an unaffiliated third party and are otherwise consistent with applicable law and this agreement this is relevant to the reasonable reliance issue since as explained herein commonwealth cannot claim reasonable reliance on wells fargos promises to indemnify legal fees upon a sale of the cdos collateral because commonwealth had a duty to sell the collateral if it was in the best interest of the coo regardless of whether it was going to receive the requested indemnification see dkt  at  there could be no causal connection between the alleged representation and commonwealths decision to liquidate the coos assets because by commonwealths own admission its decision to liquidate was dictated by its assessment of the best interests of the the cdos investors not its own pecuniary interest in recouping expenses  it should be noted that section  of the cma provides that if any term of the cma conflicts with a term of the indenture the indenture controls see dkt  at    of  filed new york county clerk   pm  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  trustee the funds are some of the cdos noteholders they claim to be beneficial holders of a significant percentage of collybuss class a notes see dkt  at  the securities and exchange commission the sec and others have filed lawsuits against commonwealth and its principal nonparty walter a morales see eg dkt  complaint in sec v commonwealth advisors inc no cv md la see also broyles v cantor fitzgerald  co  wl  md la  civil action against commonwealth and moreno by investors in commonwealth managed funds  the sec has alleged since at least  commonwealth a louisiana investment adviser and morales its principal engaged in a scheme to hide losses in certain hedge funds they advised these losses wre realized in part from significant investments that the funds held in residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs which had deteriorated in value during the recent downturn in the residential housing market to hide these losses defendants executed improper trades across the funds crosstrades that benefitted certain clients at the expense of other clients defendants also made materially false representations to investors about the amount and value of as well as the process for valuing certain mortgagebacked assets held in the funds and fabricated internal documents to justify the false valuations in addition to serving as an investment adviser to individual investors and the hedge funds commonwealth became the collateral manager to a coo known as collybus on november   commonwealth participated in creating collybus along with an investment bank  that contributed assets to the cdo and served as the lead structurer placement agent and arranger for collybus defendants participated in forming collybus in part by removing failing rmbs from certain commonwealth funds and selling the impaired securities to collybus to be included in the coo portfolio investors in collybus purchased notes that paid a return so long as the assets that comprised the portfolio continued to perform the return on the collybus notes was dependent upon the performance  both actions appear to be ongoing the most recent opinion in the sec action was issued on january   see sec v commonwealth advisors inc  wl  md la  while the court focuses on the sec action herein it should be noted that the broyles action has been the subject of at least  judicial opinions the most recent of which appears to have been issued on september   see broyles v cantor fitzgerald  co  wl   at   md la     of  filed new york county clerk   pm  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  of the rmbs and other assetbacked securities that comprised the collybus portfolio see dkt  at i  when the rmbs market deteriorated  the sec claims that rather than disclose the losses commonwealth and morales engaged in a scheme to hide them from investors this scheme included removing declining rmbs from commonwealthadvised accounts and funds    by selling the impaired securities to collybus see id at  the funds further explain the actions allege a broad range of misconduct including defrauding investors in those other funds by concealing losses that those funds had incurred one of the ways that commonwealth is alleged to have concealed those losses is through selling deteriorated rmbs to collybus at backdated prices and then using the proceeds the funds received from those offmarket sales to purchase collybus notes through this scheme commonwealth is alleged to have masked the existence of losses through replacing direct investments in deteriorated rmbs that needed to be marked to market with indirect investments in the same collateral through collybus notes that could be recorded at higher prices because they were marked to model see dkt  at  the funds also contend that while collybus was referenced in these litigations the substance of the claims concerned commonwealths duties to its managed funds not its collybusrelated duties which are not the source of any of the claims asserted in those actions the secs complaint alleges a litany of other misconduct which is not repeated here   familiarity with rmbs rmbs backed cdos and the effect of the financial crisis on such investments is presumed  the federal
