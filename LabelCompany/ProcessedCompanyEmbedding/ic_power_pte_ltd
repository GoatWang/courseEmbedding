located in key energy markets in latin america the caribbean and israel additionally in january  we completed our acquisition of energuate comprised of two electricity distribution companies in guatemala deorsa and deocsa marking our initial entry in the electricity distribution sector the power generation companies within our portfolio utilize a range of energy sources including natural gas hydroelectric heavy fuel oil or hfo diesel and wind we principally focus our generation operations in latin american markets which typically have higher growth rates of gross domestic product or gdp and lower overall and per capita energy consumption as compared with more developed markets we believe that economic growth in latin american markets will drive increases in overall and per capita energy consumption and therefore require significant additional investments in power generation assets in those markets as of september   our installed capacity and proportionate capacity were  mw and  mw respectively including kanan’s  mw thermal generation project in panama which reached its commercial operation date or cod in april  samay i’s  mw coldreserve thermoelectric project in peru which reached cod in may  and cerro del águila sa’s or cda’s  mw hydroelectric plant located in peru which plant’s three generating units reached cod in august  in addition in august  we acquired advanced integrated energy or aie which currently operates an  mw plant in israel and holds a conditional license for the construction of a cogeneration power station in israel aie commenced construction of the plant in june  and the aie plant which is expected to have a capacity of  mw is expected to reach its cod by early  icp’s activities started in  when inkia energy limited or inkia a subsidiary of israel corporation ltd or ic an israeli conglomerate acquired globeleq americas limited’s or globeleq’s power generation assets in latin america which represented  mw of installed capacity in  ic formed icp and contributed both inkia and opc rotem ltd or opc to icp in january  ic transferred icp to kenon our sole shareholder in connection with ic’s spinoff of kenon in march  kenon effected an internal reorganization pursuant to which it transferred all of its equity interests in icp to us between  and september   we invested approximately  billion in the acquisition development and expansion of our power generation and distribution assets of this amount investment in power generation assets represented  billion of which  represented investments in greenfield development including investments made in cda samay i and kanan and  represented acquisitions we have financed our greenfield development using a combination of cash on hand debt financing and investments by minority shareholders at the asset level and have financed the acquisitions of our power generation assets using cash on hand as of september   of the  mw that we have added to our installed capacity since inkia’s formation  was derived from greenfield development projects consisting primarily of our construction of kallpa generación sa’s or kallpa’s combined cycle plant peru’s largest power generation facility the construction of opc’s plant which became israel’s first independent power producer or ipp and the construction of the samay i project a coldreserve thermoelectric plant in peru in the same period we have acquired businesses with an aggregate installed capacity of  mw in israel and five countries in latin america as of september   we had derived  of our installed capacity growth since  from greenfield development efforts by successfully pursuing growth opportunities primarily through contracted greenfield development projects in existing markets and acquisitions of anchor investments in new markets we have expanded our regional presence diversified our generation portfolio through the addition of various facilities which use a range of energy sources and significantly increased our cash flows in  our adjusted ebitda was  million as compared to  million in  representing a compound annual growth rate or cagr of  during this period adjusted ebitda is a nonifrs measure we typically enter into longterm us dollarlinked power purchase agreements or ppas to sell capacity andor energy to customers that we believe have strong credit profiles such as large local distribution companies or nonregulated customers that are subsidiaries of large multinational corporations as of december   the weighted average remaining life of our ppas was  years including the remaining life of the ppas for cda samay i and kanan in the year ended december    of our aggregate energy sales in gigawatt hours or gwh were made pursuant to longterm ppas we believe this practice limits our exposure to fluctuations in energy spot market rates and helps us to generate strong and predictable margins and cash flows we seek to enter into ppas at prices that are equal to or higher than the prevailing spot market rates in the countries in which we operate additionally the majority of our ppas are indexed to the underlying fuel cost of the related longterm supply agreements such indexing generally limits our exposure to fuel price fluctuations including the effect of such fluctuations on our margins we believe that the stable and predictable margins and cash flows which generally result from such ppas helps us to successfully secure significant project and bankbond financing with no or limited recourse from a diverse international lender base during the construction of our greenfield projects which helps us to successfully develop our project pipeline our power generation portfolio is comprised of facilities located in key power generation markets in latin america the caribbean and israel using a range of energy sources  we are a leader in our largest market peru one of the fastest growing economies in latin america with an average gdp growth rate of approximately  per year from  through  according to the international monetary fund a mature regulatory framework and a wellrun power system as of and for the year ended december   our operating company in peru kallpa had an installed capacity of  mw representing  of peru’s installed capacity and generated  of the gross energy generated in gwh in peru kallpa represented  of our net income  of our adjusted ebitda and  of our installed capacity as of and for the year ended december   in may  samay i our coldreserve thermoelectric project reached cod providing an additional  mw of installed capacity to the peruvian market in august  we provided an additional  mw of installed capacity to the peruvian market with the completion of the three generating units of cda as a result of the completion of this project our total installed capacity in peru is  mw making us the principal power producer in peru in terms of installed capacity although energy and capacity prices in peru have recently experienced downward pressure due to oversupply of capacity in the market we expect demand and spot prices to increase in the medium term as a result of large mining and industrial projects in peru and sustained growth in underlying demand we also operate opc the first ipp in israel which in  following decades of state control opened its electricity market to private power producers as a result the electricity market in israel is still in the early stages of development israel’s energy consumption levels have also increased in recent years and are expected to continue to increase in the nearterm as of and for the year ended december   opc had an installed capacity of  mw representing approximately  of israel’s installed capacity and  of the installed capacity of ipps and generated  of the gross energy generated in gwh in israel as of and for the year ended december   opc represented  of our net income  of our adjusted ebitda and  of our installed capacity we believe that opc’s plant provides us with a strategic advantage as an early entrant to the israeli electricity market additionally given israel’s growing economy and the advanced age of its existing stateowned power generation facilities we believe opc provides us with the knowhow and visibility to pursue additional power project opportunities in israel such as the acquisition of aie which opportunities may become increasingly available to private sector participants such as us in addition to our attractive positions in peru and israel we have also developed an attractive footprint in several markets in latin america including chile and colombia and are in the process of opening a development office in mexico additionally in january  we completed our acquisition of energuate
