architecture arts food news travel around nyc around the world shop inside vanguard moto inc a motorcycle building startup at the brooklyn navy yards   shervin abdolhamidi    architecture new york news share inside the factory of vanguard moto in the brooklyn navy yard while the heydays of traditional manufacturing in brooklyn are long gone and many of the old warehouses and factories have now been converted into lofts and artist space a more urban high tech version of manufacturing still exists in the city once one of the nation’s most prolific ship manufacturing facilities today the brooklyn navy yards is a nationally acclaimed industrial park that serves as a model for modern industrial development the yard is home to over  diverse businesses employing over  people and generating over  billion in annual economic revenue the brooklyn navy yards also known as the the united states navy yard and the new york naval shipyard first started off as a facility for manufacturing merchant vessels after the revolutionary war then in  it was purchased by the us navy and became an active navy shipyard in  throughout the years the yard produced some of the countries preeminent battle ships including uss maine and uss arizona the navy yard was decommissioned in  as part of a project that sought to reduce costs through the closure of unneeded military facilities while the government initially refused to sell the yard to the city the facility was ultimately sold  months later during the nixon administration the yard was leased by seatrain shipbuilding for a brief period before the era of ship building in brooklyn came to an end in  atop rooftop reds in the brooklyn navy yard today the brooklyn navy yard has become a bustling mecca of innovative

genitals and inner thighs duggal a printing company which has recently expanded into tech manufacturing with street lights powered by solar panels and wind turbines another fascinating and exciting startup that we recently visited is the innovative motorcycle startup vanguard moto inc we sat down with david wax from vanguard to discuss the incentives behind the start up and the company’s prospect vanguard moto inc is a premium motorcycle design and manufacturing company looking to “disrupt the premium motorcycle market with their contemporary design and modular assembly process” the company was founded by entrepreneur and former consultant and supply chain expert francoisxavier terny and motorcycle designer and engineer edward jacobs both men were involved in the motorcycle market where they saw “a gap in the motorcycle market in the premium segment” according to david wax jacobs and terny believed that there are no real options in the premium range between  and  “the only motorcycles you could buy are kk motorcycles with kk of accessories strapped to them” vanguard’s motorcycle is estimated to cost  of purely design and bike components rather than accessories images via vanguard moto inc jacobs who also had some new contemporary ideas for motorcycles formed vanguard moto inc in  with terny today vanguard has a working prototype that they have tested the prototype is a testament to the contemporary design that vanguard strives for as wax says “rather than put plastic around the motorcycle to make it look nice we’re actually designing the motorcycle to look nice in its purest form” images via vanguard moto inc the bike has a fully digital dash port and led lights that are integrated into the bike and articulate out of the bike unlike most bikes which utilize a chain to power the back wheel vanguard’s design employs a shaft the designers also opted to forgo the traditional exhaust design in favor of one that is integrated into the crank case wax says “the idea was to not have the exhaust as a design element” another feature of the bike is its modular assembly the bike consists of three parts that can be assembled with five bolts and three electrical connectors the result of this contemporary design is an innovative bike that has  worth of pure essential design components images via vanguard moto inc images via vanguard moto inc vanguard is currently in the process of making some modifications and refinements to their prototype which they were able to testride around the streets of the brooklyn navy yard the estimated start of production for the bikes is mid manufacturing work will take place in the navy yard and wax says “right now we have space reserved at facilities just over there in another building in the yard for full production manufacturing” images via vanguard moto inc finally when asked why they chose the navy yards as their startup’s venue wax says “you have some of the best design and business minds in the world you also have a facility that is set up specifically for this manufacturing and startups” wax further praises the navy yard saying “the navy yards really makes this possible if it wasn’t for the navy yards we’d have to be located somewhere else the navy yard is very friendly for what we’re doing” discover more about vanguard moto on the company’s website next read about the top  secrets

brexit looms large brokerage trades will soon settle in just  days down from  vacations barbeques lazy summer days—and giving to charity research our firm with finras brokercheck reference content layer openedread the transcript liz tammaro so we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast were going to get started with our first question and jim im going to give this one to you so it makes a lot of sense before we get started lets define what is an etf jim rowley simply put an etf is an exchangetraded fund right− its a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund the fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand furthermore and i should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors whether its an index in particular or a market strategy and when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of etfs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the investment company act of  and thats the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate so for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and etfs theyre overwhelmingly similar actually liz tammaro and even thinking about that we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an etf or sorry even vice versa etf versus mutual fund and even maybe what are some of the disadvantages jim rowley ill take that because i think i dont necessarily like the word disadvantage i think differences is maybe the more appropriate term and we just addressed some of the similarities between etfs and mutual funds so its maybe more important to know what are the actual differences and really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds right− were talking about exchangetraded funds etf investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities and the price that they get is a tradeable market price mutual fund investors on the other hand they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but its back and forth with the fund itself and they get an endofday nav so we think about all the similarities and again sometimes theres a discussion about how different they are but really the differences come down to those two items its trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and its trading at a market price rather than getting the endofday nav jim rowley i think we actually have a great way to illustrate that i think we have a chart that addresses that point that doug was talking about that etfs are overwhelming they just happen to be index funds and when the chart comes up a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios but instead of breaking them down by etf versus mutual fund we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into etf and mutual fund and when you see the expense ratios you see that given an indexing strategy whether its a mutual fund or an etf the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies whether its an etf or a mutual fund so it has a lot more to do with whether or not its an indexing strategy than whether or not its an etf or a mutual fund liz tammaro and similar to that question we have another one thats come in from bruce asking about how easy is it to buy andor sell an etf versus a mutual fund− jim rowley a lot of moving parts in that question because i think the default has always been mutual funds because theyve been around longer so it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars you put your orders in in dollar terms youre happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a  pm nav you might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you with an etf investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account and now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares mutually speaking theres no fractionals there when you put your order in shares you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount so you know the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing important information

vanguard etfs visit vanguardcom or call  to obtain a prospectus investment objectives risks charges expenses or other important information are contained in the prospectus read and consider it carefully before investing vanguard etf shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars instead investors must buy and sell vanguard etf shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account in doing so the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less
