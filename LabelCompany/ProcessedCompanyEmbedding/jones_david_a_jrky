associate of jefferson county board of education chairman david jones jr was one of four people who vetted and interviewed candidates for a highlevel jefferson county public schools job last year  despite a state law that prohibits school board members from playing any role in the hiring of district personnel tess mcnair who runs the jones familys  million philanthropic foundation played a significant role last year in the districts hiring of director of strategy jonathan lowe according to emails obtained by wdrb news under the kentucky open records act mcnair who has at times acted as a selfdescribed representative of jones to jcps staff members helped narrow the field of candidates for the position formulated questions interviewed finalists and consulted with superintendent donna hargens about whom to pick emails show a state law – part of the sweeping kentucky education reform act of  – says school board members can be removed from office for “attempting to influence the hiring of any school employee” other than the superintendent and the boards attorney jones a prominent businessman who was first elected to school board in  acknowledged in an interview that he works “very closely” with mcnair but flatly denied having any “involvement or information” in the hiring of the director of strategy no one told him who had applied for the position or which candidates were interviewed jones said he added that he has “no connection” to lowe – the person who ultimately got the job “my sole interest in that context was in seeing that the position was filled” jones said mcnair did not respond to numerous requests via phone and email by wdrb news for an interview hargens said friday she isnt concerned about mcnairs connection to jones and the role she played in the hiring “tess mcnair is a community member leader who assisted with the process” hargens said it doesnt concern me at all because i know the process was fair but richard beliles state chairman of common cause kentucky a nonprofit organization that works to promote open and honest state and local government said the situation could at least create an “appearance problem” beliles requested to be informed of the circumstances without being given the names of the individuals involved “it sounds to me as though this person didnt break the law by sitting in himself but one could assume or venture to say he did it vicariously by having a member of his foundation do it” beliles said regardless of the personalities involved it doesnt appear right without commenting on the issue involving jones kentucky school boards association spokesman brad hughes said its important for school board members to be aware that by law they are “very restricted in the area of personnel” and to err on the side of caution “just because there is a business relationship between a board member and someone who is serving in some advisory capacity doesnt mean that there is influence going on” he said “but allegations can be made concerns can be raised if a board member were to ask us we would say stay away”jones mcnair in no sense his representativemcnair is executive director of the c e and s foundation which provides about  million annually in grants to dozens of nonprofit organizations around louisville jones father humana inc cofounder david a jones is the foundations president mcnair joined the foundation in  following seven years at humana where she was in strategic and communications roles before becoming special advisor to the chairman of the board during the end of david jones jrs tenure as chairman according to mcnairs linkedin profile a vanderbilt university graduate she has also worked for blue cross blue shield of north carolina and the hospital corporation of america david jones jr is the c e and s foundations treasurer and one of its three officers according to its  tax return jones said his role in the foundation is limited to overseeing its investments and grants while acknowledging he has “influence” in the small family organization he said its his father who as president has the final say on whom the organization employs mcnair is “in no sense my proxy or representative” jones said but when jones held a jcps “community conversation” on sept  emails show that mcnair helped coordinate it she informed jcps staff that the event would be at atherton high school outlined a rough agenda and asked which jcps staff members would attend “so that david will know who he can draw upon for greater detail that evening” four days prior on sept  mcnair sent an email to helene kramer who had just been named the districts chief communications officer to introduce herself and say “i work closely with david jones jr on all things related to his engagement with education” and when mcnair first offered to lend jcps a hand in picking the director of strategy she made it clear to hargens that her interest was prompted by a conversation with jones in a july   email mcnair wrote to hargens “david and i were speaking last week about the opening you have for a director of strategy the description youve developed is certainly my professional sweet spot if there is anything i can do to be helpful to you as you consider the nuances of the role the ideal candidate and the relationship youll build with the person you hire so that you will work in close partnership together please let me know as well if you need an external member for your interview team of candidates for your pipeline let me know im happy to help” asked if he suggested that mcnair get involved in the hiring process jones said  “i dont think i did  “but tess position as executive director of the ce and s foundation is one that has her deeply involved in working with most of the education organizations in the city jones said its a typical thing for her to be asked to provide technical assistancejones said its not appropriate to say that tess is my representative in my work as a member of the school boardwhen wdrb news asked jones why mcnair uses his name in her emails to district officials he said he didnt understand the issuetess and i are partners in a lot of education work he said we work very closely together but i am missing the issue here records show that hargens made mcnair part of the fourperson committee that waded through candidate resumes and interviewed finalists for the position over the following year lowe was named the districts director of strategy in september  he declined to comment for this storyaccording to the districts job description the director of strategy is the superintendents “representative and ambassador to external constituencies as directed” lowe is making  this school yearbesides hargens and mcnair the interview committee consisted of jcps ombudsman mindy eaves and tony peyton who at the time was director of policy for louisville mayor greg fischer peyton now works for the ce and s foundation and did not return a phone call for comment  hargens said its common for outside community members with relevant professional backgrounds to serve on district hiring committees she cited an organizational review of jcps in  that found problems with the districts hiring processes “administrators themselves said they didnt feel like we had an effective process that was fair and equitable” hargens said now “every time i do an interview process i use an outside community member that brings credibility and expertise”law designed to prevent nepotism micromanagement before the  education reform act kentucky had no prohibition on school board members exerting influence on district hiring leading to problems with nepotism and micromanagement hughes said “there were a number of districts where the family members of board members were hired” hughes said “so they put in language that prohibited board members from having any role in any other personnel except the superintendent and board attorney” wdrb news consulted several attorneys who work with school boards across kentucky but none were willing to offer an opinion about a situation involving jones hughes said its “a very good question” whether in general a school board member could be involved in hiring decisions through a proxy – one that apparently has not been raised before “weve never heard of an allegation – that doesnt mean it hasnt happened it just hasnt been brought to our attention” he said adding “it may not be illegal but it could be unethical” jones said mcnairs involvement in the hiring process represents nothing but her fulfilling part of her responsibility at the c e and s foundation to be “deeply involved” in improving local education “there is a big community of people who are working from many different angles to improve the whole pipeline of education” he said “im one of those people tess mcnair is one of those people reporter antoinette konz can be reached at  or tkonz on twittercopyright  wdrb

board posted on december   by david jcps aspires to be the nation’s best urban school district where every student graduates prepared for life empty words or serious intent  my term on the school board has taught me some lessons i’d like to share lesson   yes we can  jcps knows how to educate today’s struggling kids  although only half of jcps students now leave school ready for today’s competitive world we know how to improve our schools in  the school board unanimously adopted a strategy to do so at its core the strategy is simple  put more trained adults with the kids who need them and personalize learning to the individual student that’s it  bring more counselors psychologists social workers and teachers into jcps schools and empower our teachers to move beyond the drudgery of test prep and maintaining discipline to lead exciting learning lesson   jcps can pay for needed change without big new taxes or state or federal help  adding more adults to our classrooms will cost money — lots of it  unhappily louisville can expect little new support from frankfort where attention is focused on saving the state’s gasping retirement systems  and who knows what if anything will come from washington happily jcps has the resources in its current budget to add hundreds of new adults to its classroom workforce – if it will change how it spends its money  outside studies and audits have for years found that jcps spends way too much outside of its classrooms  unlike her predecessors superintendent hargens with the support of the board under my leadership commissioned a detailed study of jcps compensation the first since  which identified  million per year in nonteacher compensation that exceeds local and peerdistrict benchmarks  this painstaking work turned the easy generalities of auditors and critics into a page report that identifies overspending by lineitem and jobcategory with an action plan to move money saved into education—without layoffs and with continued raises to keep teacher pay competitive putting  million behind its strategy would let jcps hire  additional teachers counselors psychologists and social workers in addition to the roughly  now in these roles  or hire a smaller number of professionals and make an enormous investment in training  no wonder brent mckim president of the teachers’ union tweeted in april that “the good news in the salary review is there is  million in admin overhead that can and should be reducedshifted to support students” lesson   these changes will require political courage—which i fear won’t exist  sadly mr mckim’s tweet was the only support he gave to restructuring jcps in support of classroom teachers  within days of the salary study’s release his teachers union had frightened teachers into marching with other jcps unions to protest its findings  within weeks a campaign to oust the superintendent was underway  and when the teachers’ union interviewed candidates for school board this fall they reserved their support for candidates who pledged to replace the superintendent union candidates won all three board seats in november  when the new board convenes in january five of the seven members will have expressed solidarity with and owe their election to the teachers’ union with jcps employee surrogates in charge of the board there is no chance that the needed restructuring of nonteacher salaries will occur – and no chance that meaningful new resources will go into jcps classrooms where they are desperately needed lesson   if louisville won’t solve jcps’ problems frankfort will try  the new reality in frankfort means that jcps’ archaic structure will face big challenges most consequential for jcps would be passage of a righttowork law which could liberate jcps students and principals from union rules that put the least experienced teachers in schools with the neediest students and create the highest teacher turnover for students who most need stability in their adult relationships charter school legislation also seems certain to pass and is stirring lots of emotion though only a small percentage of jcps students would attend a charter as the new republican supermajority in frankfort focuses on education the new board’s failure to move the  million into our classrooms may invite even stronger intervention one final lesson  good governance is about results which requires making tough and sometimes unpopular decisions  almost everyone in education cares deeply about children and believes teaching is our society’s most important job caring is important – but for the governing board of a big district care is shown by making hard choices that get results by budgeting for positive change not just talking about it by prioritizing the needs of today’s students over the wants of adults who benefit from this antiquated system—even when those adults engineered or funded board members’ election i’m proud of my work with superintendent hargens to define a funded pathway to educate all our children  i urge louisvillians to insist that our elected officials in frankfort as well as louisville see that jcps improve as i know it can board report of david a jones jr posted on december   by david it’s been an honor to serve on and chair this board  all of us agree that nothing’s more important than educating louisville’s children and i’ve learned from and value my relationships with each of you  it’s also been a privilege to serve the students and families who are jcps’ customers and the  employees who serve them  and to work with some great executives tremendous analysts and unsung heroes in this administration one of the realities of chairing a board is that you rarely get to speak in your own voice  like other members you have only one vote but you have the added duty to seek and enunciate consensus or compromise among your colleagues and to voice the majority view even when it is not your own so for the past two years i’ve rarely spoken just for myself  since my term as chair is ending now i will we’ve made some progress in the past four years  importantly we allowed the superintendent to be honest about the appalling reality that less than half of jcps students attain proficiency during their time in our schools  we helped her create a strategy to dramatically change this reality by personalizing education to the needs of the individual child even more important we empowered her to create a plan to fund this strategy without relying on empty dreams of new state or federal money or immoral imaginings that our teachers can get better results without more resources and training dr hargens’ funding plan responded to the many outside audits that criticized the district for spending too much money on administration and provided detail on where this money sits in our budget this plan is right here  this is the salary study the first since  that identifies  million that could be moved into our classrooms – with no layoffs no firings and with teachers continuing to get step increases and annual raises so their pay stays competitive  let me repeat  no layoffs and teachers continue to get raises and step increases with  million jcps could hire  new professionals  certified teachers nurses social workers counselors psychologists  or  new professionals and a fabulous investment in training  we could radically change the studentteacher ratio in the schools where kids need it the most and provide the other professionals who would enable teachers to teach instead of play social worker or provider of school supplies or disciplinarian there is  million in the book  it is all here  a line by line listing of where we find the money in the existing budget no new money from frankfort no charity from mark zuckerberg or bill gates  no extraordinary tax increase  this is about current jcps money which the board has the power to spend on the kids who need it all that is needed is the will to restructure our ancient compensation system for the benefit of louisville’s kids  this won’t be easy because it will require moving money to support kids who need it rather than looking out for the wants of adults who band together for the biggest piece of the pie they can grab the adults have their voice through their unions  our struggling kids on the other hand have much less political clout  their only hope is that this board will act to restructure the school system so that it serves them far better than it does today you have been handed the knowledge to direct funding to its rightful and most urgently needed place  the classroom  the work has been done it’s in this book the voters said they want change  i wish you the courage and discipline to deliver the success all jcps students deserve what i’ve been reading about education the prize posted on june   by david since i posted the first of series of book reviews on this blog a few weeks ago insider louisville published my review of  dale russakoff’s “the prize who’s in charge of america’s schools”  my best most thoughtprovoking read of   i hope you’ll leave comments with your own recommendations of books articles podcasts or other resources that may help inform our dialogue around education in louisville you can leave your comments here on my blog or join the conversation on my facebook page and through twitter what i’ve been reading about education posted on may   by david over the past year or so i’ve found time to read some thoughtful provocative books about education amidst the daily flood of news and realtime journalism several of these influenced my thinking about louisville’s public schools and i strongly recommend them to anyone interested in improving education here or elsewhere in the united states  in addition two shorter pieces plus one podcast stand out as vital in thinking about louisville schools’ situation and more thoughtprovoking books and stories are being published all the time so perhaps i’ll update this if useful in the coming weeks i’ll be publishing these reviews here on my blog feel free to leave comments with your own recommendations of books articles podcasts or anything else that may help inform our dialogue around education in louisville you can leave your comments here on my blog or join the conversation on my facebook and twitter pages let’s get started what i learned from the smartest kids in the world this week in my what i’ve been reading about education series i review the smartest kids in the world and how they got that way by amanda ripley ripley who now writes for time magazine and the atlantic says she’d never intended to write about education but got captivated by its “real mystery” she describes this mystery as intensely frustrating “why are some kids learning so much—and others so very little” she then takes the reader on a world tour that gives a powerful answer ripley focused her research on three countries that have achieved extraordinary results over the past several decades from their public schools systems but are otherwise very different finland south korea and poland her descriptions of these countries’ journeys are inspiring and persuade the reader in a way that raw test data cannot that us public education has indeed fallen behind she adds life to policy descriptions and data by reporting on the experiences of american exchange students in each country and the us high schools each came from this makes for interesting reading sometimes funny and sometimes sad as her “field agents” – the american kids – encounter new ways of doing things and sometimes deep loneliness ultimately she finds that educators in topperforming countries face challenges quite similar to those in the american context “politics bureaucracy antiquated union contracts and parental blind spots—the surprisingly universal plagues of all education systems everywhere” what sets apart the nations that have done best in education over the past decades she finds is at once softer and harder citizen commitment to rigor in education all major shifts    require a feeling that spreads among people like a whispered oath kitchen table by kitchen table until enough of them agree that something must be done    all children must learn rigorous higherorder thinking to thrive in the modern world the only way to do that is by creating a serious intellectual culture in schools one that kids can sense is real and true her hopeful conclusion is that as more data “spills out” from places where students are achieving and “students themselves find ways to tell the world how much more they could do” american students will receive the respect of a rigorous education as kentucky’s legislature takes up our new governor’s call to modify education standards that only recently were finally raised to respect our students’ ability to learn at the level of those in the world’s top ranks ripley’s finding is much on my mind longer reviews appeared here in the washington post and new york times finding and funding improvement posted on may   by david at last night’s meeting of the jefferson county board of education i commented on recent concerns within the jcps community and among broader louisville stakeholders about possible changes affecting student discipline rules and employee salaries  here’s the text of my remarks two weeks ago members of the jefferson county board of education met in work sessions to discuss the code of conduct and the recent salary study  the weeks since then have been difficult for our jcps community and i want to say a few words about the board’s perspective as our meeting begins tonight my fellow board members and i are distressed that our work sessions have left so many teachers feeling disrespected and undervalued because nothing could be further from the truth we treasure our teachers and their commitment to the students in our district we understand how hard they work and that the conditions in schools are often challenging we know that a great teacher is worth his or her weight in gold – and while we can’t pay that we intend to maintain a competitive salary structure we know that our system of discipline must be improved and we are committed to investing in great teachers and safe and wellresourced classrooms because success – for every student – is our highest priority we hear the unhappiness with how jcps has communicated on these topics but we took up these topics for important reasons  and it’s no good pretending that the work will be easy or taking refuge in calling each other names or blaming our problems on bad communication every member of this board ran for office and was elected because we believe our schools must improve we are not content with the academic results which suggest that only half our kids are graduating ready for their future we are not content with school climate or discipline with teachers telling us regularly of eroding standards of student behavior even as suspension rates rise we are not content with the onesizefitsall environments imposed by standardized testing even as we value the insights this gives us into gaps within and between our schools we are not content with the equity delivered by our schools with neighborhood family income race and other factors correlating so highly with student learning the board spent the bulk of  consulting deeply with the community with national experts with the teachers’ association and with other internal stakeholders on how to improve  these consultations are reflected in our strategy vision  which calls for significant change so that jcps delivers deeper and more personalized learning beyond what’s measured in today’s bubble tests successful investment in building the capacity of our teachers and principals so they can teach and lead today’s youth staffing our schools and coordinating other services that overcome the social factors that impede so many of our students – including more psychological and behavioral supports in schools and more having asked our district leaders to drive change the board expects them to propose it  if we’re not content with student behavior we must be open to hearing and debating new ideas about how to change — that’s what was going on in the code of conduct work session  having demanded changes that we know cost money we must be open to proposals about where to find it  that’s what the salary study work session was about the elected board together has asked the superintendent to take on hard issues  we know it will be messy after all there’s no national blueprint for how to succeed in big city public education no other large urban district whose success we can simply copy  we wish all the people up here spoke with the tongues of angels but we like the district’s executive leadership are busy people who don’t always find the right words and sometimes clang like noisy gongs so the board respects the concerns of our teachers and regrets the disruption but we are united behind vision  which we believe represents the community’s call for improvement in its schools  and we expect continued focus and tenacity in finding and funding improvement one final point this hard work is made harder when professionals who help shape public opinion don’t share their knowledge of the issues at hand  i’ve said before how grateful the board is for the small number of media outlets that fund full time paid professional reporters to cover education in louisville  i’m still grateful for that but just as i praise good reporting when it shines needed light on hidden issues i want to express my disappointment with the quality of reporting over the last two weeks  the reporters who sit through every board meeting and work session have a deeper understanding of the board’s work than our teachers and citizens can have they know for example that the board sets its own agenda – a subject on which we’ve spoken ad nauseum this year — and that interim reports and recommendations from community committees don’t lead automatically to board action  they know jcps is party to union contracts and that thoughts about salary are subject to negotiation not board fiat in short they know there’s a difference between the sausage factory of work sessions and formal recommendations to the board  and yet both reporting and silences over the past two weeks have frightened our teachers and enraged our community by creating the impression that action was imminent to cut salaries and weaken standards for behavior and discipline this was never the case and i ask our colleagues in the fourth estate to think not just of likes and followers and retweets but of the community they serve budgeting for excellence with equity posted on january   by david it’s that time of year again  jcps is starting to put together its budget  as always this is a complicated technical undertaking involving predictions about how strong the local economy will be which affects how much local tax revenue will come in and how many students will enroll which affects how much state money the district will receive as well as guesswork about what our friends in frankfort and washington might choose to spend this is also the time of year when the first steps toward spending commitments are made and the district determines spending levels for schools later stages of the budget process will consider spending on central services human resources facilities and all other jcps activities the process starts with school level spending because that’s what kentucky law and the practicalities of the calendar require what’s unusual this year is that the early technical stage of budgeting has attracted a lot of attention and discussion both among jcps principals and central administrators and in the broader public  i think this is a really good thing let me explain   improving the budget process for years jcps budgeting and spending have been shrouded in mystery and nearly impenetrable  multiple outside audits have criticized the district for a lack of clarity in how spending was tied to claimed objectives and criticized the school board for not understanding the budgets it approved  the district has taken those recommendations to heart and changed its process to allow for more transparency and input – all good things the district created a “citizen transparency” website accessible here that lets any citizen view at any time budgeted and actual spending at both the school and district level with the ability to drill into contracts and even individual employee’s salaries  the board established a working group that included community experts to help map out the budgeting process and shine light on how money decisions are made and hired a new chief business officer to drive alignment between spending and goals we’re starting to see the fruits of these efforts for the first time since i’ve been on the board i’ll have the opportunity to vote at the beginning of the process on spending choices that i understand after several clear presentations from jcps’ finance team and healthy input from colleagues and the public  for the first time i have a clear understanding at this stage of budgeting of which costs are truly fixed by law or contract and which are discretionary in the sense that they might be shifted to different priorities this very real progress has resulted in passionate debate about where and how jcps spends its money at the school level  should all schools have the same studentteacher ratios  how much flexibility should reside with sitebased councils versus central decisionmakers  are there teachers in nonclassroom positions or extra administrators whose time would be better spent elsewhere these are hard important questions  healthy organizations engage in this sort of debate at budget time with intensity and zeal so that the clash of defending the status quo and proposing change yields better results than either centralized diktat or decentralized inertia   i’m seeing more intensity this year and i believe that is healthy   the only unhealthy piece has been some confusion and misinformation about whether spending is being “cut” which it emphatically is not – spending on teachers will rise under all contemplated budget scenarios later this year the budget process will consider other areas of spending – central services human resources facilities – with the focus on aligning every dollar of spending to the district’s improvement strategy via “zero base” review so it’s important that the district strengthen this healthy capacity to make tough budget decisions   so what those still awake after these comments on the inside baseball of budgeting are surely asking “so what why should we care and why on earth should we be pleased that the budget has created more commotion this year” we should care because developing a budget is the first step in executing the district’s strategy for reaching the morethanhalf of its students who today are not getting a good enough education  this strategy just adopted in december and framed in the words “vision   excellence with equity” calls for doing things differently in order to get different results this strategy which i wrote about here calls for moving beyond standardized academic testing to evaluate and teach students for adding resources in children’s early years so that all read on grade level by the end of third grade for personalizing education especially to overcome the impact of social factors like poverty that challenge so many students and more  i believe with all my fellow board members that this strategy can change many lives for the better and change the trajectory of our school system as a whole but strategies come to life only if real people with real salaries are tasked with action  and this means the strategic initiatives require money jcps can get money in two ways  it can bring in new money or reinvest money it’s been spending elsewhere  ideally we’d do both – but no one i know expects frankfort or washington to step in to fund louisville’s priorities in the near term  nor are board members’ inboxes filled at tax time with pleas to raise taxes to improve our schools if we want vision  to be more than pretty words on paper louisville must take the lead on louisville’s needs  we have to evolve and move our money to solve our problems  our students and our city’s future depends on jcps’ improvement public engagement matters posted on february   by david wdrb reported today httpbitlybeqcae that my colleague tess mcnair participated in an advisory committee that helped superintendent hargens hire a jcps executive and that this is improper here are my thoughts i value aggressive reporting about all our public institutions  sunshine is the best disinfectant and citizens owe a debt of gratitude to the reporters who dig into facts and work to connect the dots  in addition i support the legal provisions and legislative intent regarding antinepotism and noninterference with management duties as it relates to school board members that said i see nothing improper here  if my colleagues on the board at the kentucky school boards association or others have different views or concerns i welcome them if there’s an actual error here i will correct it but here are the facts superintendent hargens has regularly sought input and guidance from qualified community leaders to help her interview and hire strong executives she brought nonjcps employees into the interview process in response to a scathing thirdparty review of central office staffing that found jcps administrative leadership to be insular and inbred and noted that “employment processes are widely perceived as discriminatory in favor of friends or relatives” httpbitlydfjqj pp  tess advised dr hargens in this context and the process resulted in the appointment of an executive with whom i have no work history or any other relationship  although tess informed me that she had volunteered to help and dr hargens told me that tess was on the advisory committee i had no information about or involvement with the applicants or the selection process i thank tess for her tireless work in support of jcps jctc simmons college business leaders for education  degrees and all the other louisville education institutions with which she’s engaged  she’s a pro i’m blessed to have her as a colleague and in my view louisville is fortunate she’s taken on the mission we share  improving education outcomes in louisville my deepest concern here is that a story that depicts a highly qualified member of louisville’s education improvement community as a minion and “proxy” and implies that civic engagement is somehow shameful will cause other talented community leaders to think twice about working with the ancient structure that is jcps  that would be a shame just as sunlight is the best disinfectant outside pressure is essential for jcps to improve  keep pushing setting the course to become america’s best urban public school district posted on january   by david i am honored that my colleagues elected me chair of the jefferson county board of education last night and look forward to continuing the board’s work on behalf of enhancing student learning  here’s the rough text of remarks i delivered at last night’s board meeting i want to thank my fellow board members for their trust and support as i take on this role i am keenly aware that as a school board we have a major responsibility to the public  simply put the governance this body provides the expectations we set and the priorities we pursue set the tone for the system as a whole and create the conditions under which our superintendent principals and teachers can ensure that all students learn our newly constituted board finds itself at a real inflection point  the district in some ways is hitting its stride with annual gains in student achievement moving us from kentucky’s th percentile in  to the st percentile last year  these increases in academic success are historic and very unusual nationally for big urban districts  we also inherit from our predecessor board a strong positive relationship of partnership and candor with dr hargens our superintendent  i thank our colleague diane porter and our former colleagues for these crucial elements of strength on which this board can build yet every member of this board sought election because we know we must do better  we know that even with improvement spelled out in state accountability tests less than half our students are proficient in reading and math  we know that at each board meeting we sit in front of this reminder that jcps is “shaping the future”  and we know that as the superintendent was told by a community leader when she arrived “as jcps goes so goes louisville” –if our students don’t thrive our community cannot prosper in the years ahead the superintendent and board have driven progress to date by executing a strategy called “vision ”  during our new member orientation sessions following the november election dr hargens made two things very clear first we are in the midst of the “execution phase” of vision  where performance on the strategy’s basic elements should drive further improvement  and second “doing what we’ve done to get us here won’t get us where we want to go from here”  that is new strategies and tactics are needed to achieve our vision of every student graduating prepared for life or to get us to our broad goal of becoming the best urban district in america  dr hargens has called on the board to work with her starting immediately in building a new “vision ” from conversation with each of you i know that the sense of the board is that we are up for this and we intend not only to ask for the district to change as necessary to bring students to higher levels of learning but to change our own practices as needed in accepting the position as chair i commit to you my colleagues that i have heard loud and clear the sense of the board that we must improve the way we do our business so that we can do well in all three of the essential elements of governing a big organization through change  monitoring operational improvement driving strategic vision and goalsetting and assuring compliance  in conversation i have learned that all of us are determined to do more than sit in headquarters and monitor compliance  we know we need to find time to question and learn so that we are adequately prepared for the decisions that lie ahead and to create the accountability that will empower the change agents in our schools and management team who reach our students so here are three structural changes i will work to see us implement to ensure the board’s time is aligned with what we are seeking from the district first we will change the location of our meetings to bring us into the schools at least once per month — starting with our next meeting which i propose take place at valley high school on january   this change of venue has several goals  to enliven and broaden the board’s contact with the community to highlight the strengths and challenges of our schools and to create shared experiences in the schools that will strengthen board understanding and decisionmaking second we will form ourselves into projectbased teams to work with the superintendent and senior leadership to dive deeper into key issues and help us create deeper board understanding around critical strategic drivers  in jcps parlance think of these as board “professional learning communities”  initial teams are finance  what data does the board require to be effective at setting and intelligently monitoring progress toward reallocating dollars to the programmatic and instructional practices that accord with our goal technology utilization what new competencies must the district build to serve st century stakeholders and how can the board set goals and measure progress as these competencies are built  possible examples include how the board can ensure that the district is moving effectively and rapidly in this digital age to modernize customer service and to empower constituents with clear information and ecommerce capabilities that make choosing schools and scheduling services more accessible to all our families policy and pedagogy  with our policy manual largely up to kentucky standards what new policy issues must the district confront and how can the board ensure that we adopt the best framework for today’s learners   for example do we need to be looking beyond test scores to assess deeper learning and if so how is jcps teacher training up to the task of helping teachers grapple with new technologies and social realities invest in modernizing professional development the third change relates to the quality of our work together as board and management the board learned last february from an audit of board time that compared to high performing school boards we spend too much time on “management inquiry” and not enough on “goal monitoring”  this board is determined to change that – but we need support from our colleagues in management  to help us avoid deep dives into micromanagement we must ask you to enhance both the quality and the candor of your presentations  we need your reporting to focus on clear analysis of progress toward jcps’ goals  don’t just share data with us  tell us what it means and what you recommend we should do about it  know that we will have read your submissions ahead of time through our wonderful board portal so don’t read your slides to us  share additional insights or just summarize and invite questions in closing i am confident that jcps has a great year ahead  i thank each of my colleagues for your service on this board and your confidence in me as chair and i express the board’s excitement about working with the wonderful leadership and people of jcps as we move forward to execute on the basics to fix or eliminate what’s not working or no longer relevant and to celebrate learn from and proliferate what’s working well wfpl misses the point about school board posted on november   by david i applaud wfpl for its coverage of education in louisville and i’m grateful that on friday the station attempted to explain to voters what they elect school board members to do  “when you vote for a school board what are you voting for“  that said i have rarely read a better example of getting the details right but missing the point of course board members do the things wfpl describes  follow rules and procedures hire the superintendent approve contracts educate themselves about the issues and listen to constituents and share their concerns left out though is the fundamental duty of board members under kentucky’s constitution to serve as “trustees” for the voters in “providing for an efficient system of common schools”  like board members for private nonprofit or forprofit corporations but unlike legislators or metro council members school board members are fiduciaries bound to use their best judgment to see that the district delivers on its duty to provide education efficiently and effectively this means that board members’ duty extends beyond “checking the box” of complying with regulations beyond learning about policy beyond the satisfaction fun and frustration of talking with parents and teachers and beyond the passive task of listening to management reports  where an organization is not delivering on its duty to the voters — as jcps despite encouraging progress still is not — board members must focus on the barriers to delivery and require that management lead whatever change is necessary with less than half of jcps students qualifying as “proficient” in the most recent state evaluation sharpening the district’s focus is clearly the board’s next task   jcps financial transparency improving posted on october   by david the usually dry and technical business of overseeing school budgets generated some controversy over the last several months on may  kentucky’s state auditor reported that jcps spent less in the classroom than comparable public school districts maintained a “bloated” administrative structure and was governed by a board that neither understood district finances nor demanded information to help it do so one week later two school board members including me voted against adoption of a proposed jcps budget on the grounds that management’s presentation due to a lack of standard financial analysis like trend data or tying shifts in spending within large categories to the board’s strategic plan did not adequately facilitate a critical evaluation of the proposed budget in the five months since the state auditor’s report jcps has taken several noteworthy steps toward improvement from that low point on june  superintendent hargens proposed and the board approved a set of responses to the deficiencies reported by the state auditor  most responses called for change in procedures or quality of administrative work and all identified both a deadline and the executives responsible for delivering on august  the board considered the tax rate for the coming year   unlike a year earlier jcps management presented a clear case for the amount of revenue needed to fund plans for the coming year the superintendent and her cfo made clear that an improving economy coupled with additional state appropriations were producing new revenue to the tune of or mm–above the prior year at current tax rates and recommended that no rate increase was needed  the board unanimously approved this recommendation in early september dr hargens announced a “citizen transparency” website that will enable anyone to dig through jcps financial data including both spending in each school and the actual salary of every jcps employee by name and title  jcps’ original announcement projected the tool to go live by the end of september and although software implementation issues seem to have delayed the startdate it’s my expectation that this tool will bring many new eyes and analytical skills to considering how our education dollars are spent finally on september  dr hargens and her team presented the  budget to the school board in a new format that included for the first time trend analysis for major categories of spending and a narrative that tied spending decisions to district strategy i joined the rest of the board in unanimously adopting this budget it’s clear to me that jcps has made important changes both to improve the transparency of its finances and to sharpen how the analytical skills of its executives are applied to finding and deploying funding for our schools  the work of superintendent hargens and cfo cordelia hardin along with other leaders has given me new insight into several important facts and trends about our school system for instance management’s clearer presentation of financial facts shows that spending in schools has grown significantly  per year since  and faster than overhead spending shown to have grown at  per year  using management’s numbers from this year’s budget presentation cfo’s powerpoint of  the following graph shows spending growth over the past five years plus the justadopted budget this helpful analysis shows an astounding increase –  million — in annual spending on “schools and support” between  and  whereas spending on “business office and overhead” increased by  million  dr hargens’ freeze on central office hiring and movement of several hundred teachers from central positions back into the schools as “goal clarity coaches” likely explains the relative slowdown in overhead spending however and appropriately new and important questions have also crystallized thanks to this welcome increase in transparency first the categorization of only  of jcps expenses as “business offices” or “overhead” conflicts sharply with the state auditor’s finding that only  of jcps spending was on “instruction”  it is obvious that financial officers at different levels — state auditor’s office and local school district — disagree sharply on how to categorize expenses  the onus is on jcps to explain itself in the face of the auditor’s aggressively different interpretation if citizens and board members are to have confidence in the seemingly positive story told in the graph above second the fact that spending from the general fund has grown at  per year since  fairly begs for questioning of the frequent contention that our schools are “underfunded” at the same time inclusion of rapidly rising payments under state pension and health benefit plans in the “schools and support” category may mask how frankfort’s past mismanagement of retirement obligations siphons funds today from the district  the role of state pension and health benefit payments is a subject i need to learn more about due to its potentially monumental impact on future budgets third it is now clear that district management considers the end goal of its financing activity to be equitable allocation of funds to school councils ie the “schoolbased decision making” councils called sbdms  this is highlighted in the organization of the new budget booklet which directed primary attention to “allocations to school councils” and to “schooladded” categories i found this narrative quite striking since virtually none of the board’s work involves reviewing the efficacy or efficiency of these councils or the principals they select in achieving the district’s mission  the lack of such oversight is highlighted by the fact that despite the great effort and history which lies behind the board’s attempt to fund individual school councils adequately and equitably student outcomes still vary widely both between and within schools  the state auditor’s attention to teachers’ spending of personal funds on school supplies called attention to schoollevel decisions to spend district supply allocations on other things or not at all and others have pointed out that some school councils choose not to spend district funds allocated for textbooks to “trade out” teacher positions for teaching assistant positions or to take other steps that are at odds with district strategy as a school board member i have found the allocation of authority between central office and school councils confusing and a frequent source of blameshifting  our new budget narrative invites attention to this issue  what data does jcps have on the effectiveness of schoollevel leadership and what tools do we deploy where this leadership is not getting the job done  how should the elected board hold management accountable when decisionmaking authority is disbursed and sometimes opaque under state law and practice in sum i believe jcps has made important progress since the state auditor’s constructive report and as a board member i acknowledge the difficult and creative work that has gone into rethinking how to tell the complex financial story of this big organization  all involved agree that steps to date are only the beginning and that further improvement is both possible and required  my hope and expectation is that ever better analysis will sharpen the focus on how to direct spending to best serve our kids jones david a jrky insider insider trades
