history british history world wars historic figures family history hands on history history for kids on this day the legacy of the reformationby bruce robinson last updated  the causes and impact of the reformation have attracted debate for centuries so what theories have been put forward and why has all the research failed to provide any consensus can it ever be possible to draw conclusions from an event such as the reformation on this page versions of events a new approach personal perspectives public opinion find out more page options print this page versions of events history is edited imagine youve just had an argument with your mother and youre telling a friend about it do you include the whole story no you make a judgement and you edit the details the argument is between henry viii and mother rome now go back  years the argument is between henry viii and mother rome as a historian you have the same problems and more what have the contemporary accounts forgotten hidden or ignored some of the documents may be in latin french or spanish but linguaphone wont be much use  this is official language with idioms long since lost are you reading a good translation or translating correctly yourself to make life even more challenging do you have all the documents are they all there some you know have been lost in the intervening centuries but maybe others are lost that you never knew existed so before you turn up history has already been edited both by design and by accident but theres still a huge amount of material so you make priorities you make judgements some sources are more valuable than others its like reading a whodunnit when the pages arent numbered theyre out of order and some are missing then you write your thesis article or book you have reams of notes to analyse and not enough space for everything again you make professional judgements regarding their relative value you edit so when the history we read is the product of a series of value judgements some of which we know some of which we dont is it surprising that those judgements are questioned by others maybe they have their own agenda maybe they have seen documents you have not either way they disagree with your interpretation no wonder historians disagree when there is so much to disagree on the history of historical disagreements is so established that it even has its own word  historiography this is about the historiography of the reformation top a new approach it was a quiet world until the sixties the conventional view was that henry wanted to break from rome and so after some time figuring out how he broke it was decided enforced and finished mary tried to change it all but didnt have much chance as england was by that stage protestant this all changed in  with the publication of the english reformation by ag dickens he took this familiar story but broke new ground by using local archives  originally those of york  to highlight both the independent contribution of specific reformers and the power of protestantism to convert people before and against official government policy the reformation was sought after and wellreceived by an england ready and willing to embrace the new religion this view prompted the debate that has yet to be fully resolved how did a catholic country become protestant using the same methods as dickens the s saw the birth of the revisionist case in  christopher haigh studying tudor lancashire found much support for prereformation catholicism there as well as considerable resistance to protestantism that lasted well into elizabeths reign there was not one reformation but several more controversially he developed a national analysis from his regional research there was not one reformation but several all had shortterm political causes not longer term social and economic ones despite some murmurs in the wings the catholic church in england was alive and well and the reformation was forced onto the country from above by henry and parliament this fitted with the pioneering work of sir geoffrey elton who studied thomas cromwell and his use of parliament and statute he had concluded that in executing the reformation in the country thomas cromwell modernised government to a quite revolutionary extent top personal perspectives yet still more argument later revisionists like jj scarisbrick and eamon duffy confirmed haighs view that catholicism was alive and kicking in  on the whole english men and women did not want the reformation and most of them were slow to accept it when it came the reformation and the english people jj scarisbrick despite later work on early protestantism in london for the period before  the revisionist case has become orthodoxy beyond that it attracts more dispute yet scarisbrick also challenged eltons assumptions claiming that there was nothing new in cromwells ideas and methods and blaming the delay in breaking from rome on a cautious henry this in turn prompted the question how much was henry his own man how much did he follow advice that appeared to achieve his aims blind to the consequences david starkeys arguments that eltons perspective was too limited and that the privy chamber royal household and court all played a central part in henrys government have been broadly accepted by historians debate has consequently focused on what john guy and patrick collinson call new political history one which is social and cultural history with the politics put back in or an account of political processes which is also social elizabethan essays by p collinson who was influential in court and what was their story their context a twentieth century historian can never understand fully the workings of a sixteenth century mind but the revisionists themselves have been attacked links have been made between their promotion of the prereformation catholic church and the fact that several are themselves practising catholics diarmid macculloch has shown more sympathy with the reformers likewise keith thomas argued in his fascinating religion and the decline of magic that religion then filled a gap addressed a need when the reformation opened new gaps magic stepped in until society changed to make magic no longer necessary or desirable does his own lack of professed religious faith have any bearing on this purely functional view of religion to what degree are historical judgements made consciously or are they a product of personality ultimately a twentieth century historian can never understand fully the workings of a sixteenth century mind or conscience everyone brings their own perspective and carries their own baggage yet revisionist historians are by no means united they continue to disagree about the resilience of the catholic church to official attack it has always been difficult to square the circle of such minimal popular protest at the removal of a popular church however new work into parish accounts and tudor wills has uncovered evidence of some sly manoeuvring some communities were very successful at concealing material threatened with seizure some conservative religious beliefs could be hidden by reformist statements in wills and religious change was often negotiated with local grandees rather than arbitrarily imposed by government top public opinion the revisionist victory regarding the prereformation church has also assisted in pushing more recent research towards the end of the century to investigate the way in which england became protestant after the elizabethan settlement of  dickens treated the settlement as the end of the reformation story others have treated it as a new beginning and few believe that protestantism had taken any meaningful hold on the country until at least the s haigh has concluded that even by the end of the century prolonged clerical efforts had succeeded in creating a protestant nation but not a nation of protestants english reformations religion politics and society under the tudors by c haigh defined by its enemy catholicism this has prompted new work both into foxes book of martyrs and other anticatholic tracts and the means by which england became more protestant with continuing confusion over the degree that godly reform was taken up and the amount of generational cleansing required when did the reformation end enormous regional disparities remain in the s and patrick collinson maintains that the process cannot be neatly concluded at the turn of the century many argue that popular protestantism was not evident until the s or later with major seventeenth century historians like john morrill and conrad russell taking an increasing interest in the rise of religious radicalism in the sixteenth century is it realistic or even possible to treat the civil war as another subject with different experts and new debates many argue that popular protestantism was not evident until the s or later clearly some level of consensus exists there does appear to have been general public support for catholicism before the break from rome the  settlement is not the end of the story henry and cromwell did not govern independently of court and household compromise and cunning all played their part in the delivery of the reformed religion but much remains arguments continue over the lollards were they a serious threat or all mouth and no trousers mary also remains a controversial figure and while whatif wondering is very entertaining such counterfactual questioning can distract from the realities of her reign maccullochs new work on edward vi will hopefully shed new light on this complicated period and foreign dimensions are gaining increasing prominence tudor history has often been seen through english blinkers but how and how far did events in ireland scotland and europe influence the english reformation in the  years since dickens book first appeared so many questions remain yet history is about humans and humans are curious and complicated little surprise then that the history is as well top find out more books the religion of protestants the church in english society  by p collinson
