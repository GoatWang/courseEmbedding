customer it features passwordcontrolled system entry a verisignissued digital id for the banks server secure sockets layer ssl protocol for data encryption and a router loaded with a firewall to regulate the inflow and outflow of server traffic secure access and verifying user authenticity to begin a session with the banks server the user must key in a login id and a password our system the internet banking system uses a  strikes and youre out lockout mechanism to deter users from repeated login attempts after three unsuccessful login attempts the system locks the user out requiring either a designated wait period or a phone call to the bank to verify the password before reentry into the system upon successful login the digital id from verisign the experts in digital identification certificates authenticates the users identity and establishes a secure session with that visitor  at community bank  trust we take the safety and security of your personal information very seriously as part of our ongoing efforts to employ the latest online banking and bill pay security technology we have recently added multifactor authentication to our online banking and bill pay system secure data transfer once the server session is established the user and the server are in a secured environment because the server has been certified as a bit secure server by verisign data traveling between the user and the server is encrypted with secure sockets layer ssl protocol with ssl data that travels between the bank and customer is encrypted and can only be decrypted with the public and private key pair in short the banks server issues a public key to the end users browser and creates a temporary private key these two keys are the only combination possible for that session when the session is complete the keys expire and the whole process starts over when a new end user makes a server session router and firewall requests must filter through a router and firewall before they are permitted to reach the server a router a piece of hardware works in conjunction with the firewall a piece of software to block and direct traffic coming to the server the configuration begins by disallowing all traffic and then opens holes only when necessary to process acceptable data requests such as retrieving web pages or sending customer requests to the bank using the above technologies your internet banking transactions are secure   personal checking loans check card free atms reorder checks mobile banking commercial checking loans cash management wire transfers
