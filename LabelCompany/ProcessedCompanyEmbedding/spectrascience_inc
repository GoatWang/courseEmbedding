biotech week  in san francisco ca spectrascience laserinduced fluorescence spectroscopy technology has lead to the company’s product the wavstat optical biopsy system this device is based upon technology that detects the native fluorescence of tissue fluorescence occurs when various molecular components present in tissue are “excited” at certain wavelengths of light and reemit energy in a distinct and measurable way this reemitted energy is referred to as the spectral signature healthy tissue generates a spectral signature that is measurably different from tissue that is not normal such as cancerous and precancerous tissue lif targets these chemical properties of tissue amino acids enzymes and structural proteins with this technology mr oliver claims their device can diagnose

biopsy system assists the practicing gastroenterologist who uses a flexible endoscope to find polyps that may be cancerous the capability to distinguish if the tissue is cancerous or not is made immediately and complements your expertise the physician uses laserinduced fluorescence and an optical fiber to transmit laser light via the flexible endoscope to the tissue the autofluorescence from the tissue is then collected and returned to an optical detector for analysis the result is then available with no waiting days for a pathology report simply stated we work with you to create better outcomes for your patients our value proposition is simple we improve a doctors ability to diagnose cancer and we lower the cost of diagnosis spectrascience offers a simplified yet highly effective way of diagnosing colorectal cancer early when recovery rates are high our wavstat optical biopsy system® uses light to diagnose tissue health in fact our patented technology instantly detects if tissue is normal precancerous or cancerous without the need for a costly physical biopsy according to the american cancer society over  new cases of colorectal cancer are expected in the us this year alone this dreaded disease is the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in the us after lung cancer and the third most common cancer overall only  of colorectal cancers are detected at an early stage products our proprietary wavstat optical biopsy system is used as an adjunct to the gastroenterologist in normal practice and is compatible with existing endoscopes the wavstat uses laser induced fluorescence and an optical fiber forceps to transmit laser light via endoscope to the tissue autofluorescence back from the interrogated tissue is collected and returned to an optical detector for analysis and a definitive diagnostic rendered the wavstat provides a binary suspect or nonsuspect diagnostic output which unlike traditional imagebased systems requires no analysis or interpretation technology   laserinduced fluorescence spectroscopy lif the wavstat optical biopsy system is presently based upon technology that detects the native fluorescence of tissue fluorescence occurs when various molecular components present in tissue are “excited” at certain wavelengths of light and reemit energy in a distinct and measurable way this reemitted energy is referred to as the spectral signature healthy tissue generates a spectral signature that is measurably different from tissue that is not normal such as cancerous and precancerous tissue lif targets these chemical properties of tissue amino acids enzymes and structural proteins scattering spectroscopy ss this ipprotected technology is a novel optical scientific method that will complement our lif technology in future wavstat systems it can be used in combination with lif or standalone for diagnosis ss targets physical properties of tissue vascularity epithelial thickness and cell nuclei ss employs a wavelengthdependent component of light scattered by epithelial cells to obtain information about subcellular structures such as cell nuclei since nuclear atypia is one of the hallmarks of precancerous and cancerous changes in most human tissues the technique has the potential to provide a broadly applicable means of detecting epithelial precancerous lesions and noninvasive cancers in various organs these can be optically accessed either directly or by means of optical fibers therefore ss facilitates the ability to scan the tissue and detect not merely diagnose possible cancerous lesions citable uri httphdlhandlenet multi modal in the future we envision a combination of lif and ss will provide a blend of lightbased diagnoses for optimal clinical results across many different kinds of cancer we believe that this “multimodal” future will allow us to pursue many detection and diagnosis markets with an increased number of possible strat the wavstat mobile console is the heart of the system and is comprised of a lowpower laser a sophisticated light detector an internal computer and analysis software the console incorporates a touch screen for input and output as well as the capability of interfacing with additional screens providing for example an image which can be included on a typical endoscope monitor the key to the diagnostic process is our proprietary waveform analysis algorithm

according to the american cancer society only  of colorectal cancers are detected at an early stage which is the optimum time for cure clinical studies indicate that effective screening procedures using the wavstat optical biopsy system can significantly improve conventional diagnosis during colonoscopy as demographics shift and the population ages the incidence of colorectal cancer is expected to increase substantially in addition pressure to reduce the overall cost of healthcare is accelerating statistics therefore point to increased use of the wavstat optical biopsy system to aid physicians diagnoses and save patients lives current diagnostic methods include techniques that rely upon subjective analysis and human interpretation during colonoscopy including visual assessment using highdefinition video enhanced imaging interpretation with various techniques that require training and specialized expertise preliminary clinical data suggest that wavstat technology improves
