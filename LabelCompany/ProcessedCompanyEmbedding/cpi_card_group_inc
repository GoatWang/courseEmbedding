cards per year next need help choosing  comparing id card printers here are some answersclick to enlarge image how do you pick an id card printer with so many choices available first know that every brand offers a range of printers and many come with flexible options if your card print needs will change in the future pick a model that can be upgraded later look for terms like “modular” or “field upgradable”next learn a bit about the card printer types offered by the leading brandshow do i tell the difference between all the card printersvalue class printers – the most basic card printer type these entrylevel printers are the least expensive but often do not have a wide range of options and do not offer the highest print quality they are great for lowlevel security needsprofessional class printers – this is a wide ranging group of printers that can work for many applications they include both standard and highvolume printers offer professional print quality and are great for photo id badges they can also produce medium or highsecurity id cards depending on the options you choosesecure class printers – the highest security id cards are produced by retransfer printers which use a special print technology to produce tamperresistant cards these printers and their supplies can be expensive and are best used in highlysecure areasfinally consider your top three id card factorshow many cards do you need   low volume    standard volume   high volumeid expert tip  volume is the one factor that cannot be upgraded later so choose wisely however unless you will use your printer every day you can save quite a bit by purchasing a less expensive low or standardvolume card printer it works in  of card print situationswhat will your cards look likesingle or twosided cards full color or single color monochrome print quality low surface coverage entrylevel printers offer ok print quality that works well for basic cardsmediumtohigh surface coverage professionalclass printers offer photoquality ids highest surface coverage retransfer printers offer crystalclear clarity for high security needsid expert tip – a single sided card printer can be used to print on two card sides – you just have to run it through your card printer twice some printers can also be upgraded later monochrome printers are typically used in specialized situations and don’t offer huge cost savings so it is almost always more practical to purchase a color printer and use monochrome ribbons finally the difference between the print clarity of an entrylevel printer a professionalclass printer and a retransfer printer can be big call  if you want to see some id card samples from different badge printers before you make a choicewhat level of securitybasic id or membership card – for basic visual identification any entrylevel printer and standard pvc card stock will work examples include loyalty cards membership cards student ids and gift cardslow security magnetic stripe cards – for id swiping most entrylevel and professional class printers with magnetic stripe encoder and card stock will work examples include loyalty cards hotel cards gift cards and time cardsmedium security access smart cards – for contactless access control professionalclass printers with smart card encoder will work examples include access control and kiosk payment cardshigh security laminated or retransfer cards – for uv or holographic authentication protocols professionalclass or retransfer printers with lamination module will work must use composite pvc card stock examples include high security facility access drivers’ licenses and rugged use cardsid expert tip – in order to be able to use these features you must have card stock designed for your encoding technology while magnetic stripe

need help choosing  comparing id card printers here are some answersclick to enlarge image how do you pick an id card printer with so many choices available first know that every brand offers a range of printers and many come with flexible options if your card print needs will change in the future pick a model that can be upgraded later look for terms like “modular” or “field upgradable”next learn a bit about the card printer types offered by the leading brandshow do i tell the difference between all the card printersvalue class printers – the most basic card printer type these entrylevel printers are the least expensive but often do not have a wide range of options and do not offer the highest print quality they are great for lowlevel security needsprofessional class printers – this is a wide ranging group of printers that can work for many applications they include both standard and highvolume printers offer professional print quality and are great for photo id badges they can also produce medium or highsecurity id cards depending on the options you choosesecure class printers – the highest security id cards are produced by retransfer printers which use a special print technology to produce tamperresistant cards these printers and their supplies can be expensive and are best used in highlysecure areasfinally consider your top three id card factorshow many cards do you need   low volume    standard volume   high volumeid expert tip  volume is the one factor that cannot be upgraded later so choose wisely however unless you will use your printer every day you can save quite a bit by purchasing a less expensive low or standardvolume card printer it works in  of card print situationswhat will your cards look likesingle or twosided cards full color or single color monochrome print quality low surface coverage entrylevel printers offer ok print quality that works well for basic cardsmediumtohigh surface coverage professionalclass printers offer photoquality ids highest surface coverage retransfer printers offer crystalclear clarity for high security needsid expert tip – a single sided card printer can be used to print on two card sides – you just have to run it through your card printer twice some printers can also be upgraded later monochrome printers are typically used in specialized situations and don’t offer huge cost savings so it is almost always more practical to purchase a color printer and use monochrome ribbons finally the difference between the print clarity of an entrylevel printer a professionalclass printer and a retransfer printer can be big call  if you want to see some id card samples from different badge printers before you make a choicewhat level of securitybasic id or membership card – for basic visual identification any entrylevel printer and standard pvc card stock will work examples include loyalty cards membership cards student ids and gift cardslow security magnetic stripe cards – for id
