predictive customerservicekiyateccom   cancer care by kiyatec home complementary diagnostics cancer care by kiyatec the future of cancer care kiyatec’s goal is to deliver more accurate predictions of patient response to drugs and biologics we are fulfilling this mission by applying d cellbased phenotypic models of cancer with more physiologically relevant tumor microenvironments by using the patient’s own living tumor cells these novel diagnostics will serve to better inform clinicians of the best therapeutic candidate to treat that patient’s cancer research efforts have demonstrated our system’s ability to maintain viable d tumor tissue in the lab additional development efforts have translated laboratory protocols into kiyatec’s personalized cancer diagnostic currently applied in the second of two blinded biology pilot studies using clinicallyderived patient biopsies under irb approval these clinicallyoriented studies culture the biopsy derived tumor tissue and assess its response to an array of chemotherapy and targeted agents the future of cancer care requires advanced diagnostics to assist physicians in actively selecting the most effective therapeutic for each and every patient accurate in vitro modeling of an individual’s diseasestate requires a degree of complexity that involves multiple cell types and interactions that is currently unmet by traditional “petri dish” twodimensional d cell culture as a demonstration of this fact a  study conducted by researchers at stanford university showed that traditional d cell culture models had a  correlation with the human condition while d cell culture models represented a higher human correlation than even mouse models this evidence supports kiyatec’s opportunity to use advanced d cell culture techniques in evaluating patient drug response in a personalized fashion  t ridky et al nature medicine  latest news  posters  aacr  in dc kiyatec  mayo clinic collaborate to fight ovarian cancer kiyatec announces

collaboration aims to validate the accuracy ex vivo d evd cell culture predictions against ovarian cancer patient outcomes greenville sc  june    edt – kiyatec a leader in emerging d ex vivo predictive cancer diagnostics today announced a collaboration with mayo clinic to combine their complementary technology platforms for ovarian cancer clinical care mayo clinic is actively enrolling patients in a clinical study led by principal investigator john weroha md in which patientderived xenografts pdx generate living tumor samples specific to each enrolled ovarian cancer patient the study assesses whether those samples can help determine which chemotherapy is most effective to treat that individual ovarian cancer patient should they become platinum resistant a limitation of any pdx model is that it typically takes six to nine months before data is produced  for some patients that don’t respond at all to the initial treatment information is needed in just a few weeks a challenge inherent to any clinical study of this sort – until now kiyatec similarly uses living tumor samples specific to each ovarian cancer patient in its active research study with greenville health system ghs the first healthcare provider to partner with kiyatec on this research  the difference is that kiyatec uses its d cell culture platform to generate patient specific drug response prediction data in just  days  if the research collaboration is successful kiyatec’s technology would complement the mayo approach and allow for more patients to be treated according to personalized drug response models  “this significantly advances kiyatec’s goal to validate the accuracy of our cell culture predictions against patient outcomes the gold standard for these kinds of comparisons” said hal crosswell md kiyatec’s chief medical officer about kiyatec kiyatec’s mission is to accurately predict patient response to cancer drugs using their living tumor cells in d culture and to use those predictions to improve patient outcomes reduce healthcare costs and increase success in drug development and clinical trials  the company creates and utilizes live phenotypic d cellbased models for drug response profiling and applies them to generate information relevant to preclinical testing clinical trials and clinical cancer diagnostic applications  for more information please visit
