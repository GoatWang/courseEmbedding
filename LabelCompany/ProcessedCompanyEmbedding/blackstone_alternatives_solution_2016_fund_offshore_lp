due to the partnership for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date irrespective of table of contents whether such amounts have been realized as the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either carried interest is realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the funds cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return or in limited instances after certain thresholds for return of capital are met carried interest is subject to clawback to the extent that the carried interest received to date exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results as such the accrual for potential repayment of previously received carried interest which is a component of due to affiliates represents all amounts previously distributed to blackstone holdings and noncontrolling interest holders that would need to be repaid to the blackstone funds if the blackstone carry funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying

and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to the partnerships share of this income tax is reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax

likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and b those tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot threshold are recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority blackstone recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in general administrative and other expenses within the condensed consolidated statements of operations there remains some uncertainty regarding blackstones future taxation levels over the past several years a number of legislative and administrative proposals to change the taxation of carried interest have been introduced and in certain cases have been passed by the us house of representatives that would have in general treated income and gains including gain on sale attributable to an investment services partnership interest or ispi as income subject to a new blended tax rate that is higher than the capital gains rate applicable to such income under current law except to the extent such ispi would have been considered under the legislation to be a qualified capital interest our common units and the interests that we hold in entities that are entitled to receive carried interest would likely have been classified as ispis for purposes of this legislation it is unclear whether or when the us congress will pass such legislation or what provisions will be included in any final legislation if enacted    may   c  cybernet data systems inc all
