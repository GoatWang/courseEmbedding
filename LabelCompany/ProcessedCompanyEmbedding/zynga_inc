into realmoney gambling in the uk while acknowledging zynga’s continuing challenges such as slowing sales and its low stock price some analysts were more upbeat after the q  earnings than they had been after q  earnings were announced “every single thing that they are doing is what you would want them to do” said michael pachter an analyst with wedbush securities inc comparing q to q earnings conference calls journalists noted a change in former ceo pincus’ tone “instead of blaming an uncertain economy wandering consumer tastes or a weird alignment between jupiter and mars the former ceos message to wall street was clear blame us” wrote cnet in early  zynga former ceo mark pincus announced that farmville one of zyngas most popular games had reached  billion in total player bookings business modeledit zynga is supported in two manners via direct credit card payments and partner businesses several zynga games require an energy characteristic to play engaging in missions a core feature of many games consumes a certain amount of energy after expending energy it slowly replenishes to the characters maximum limit this can take minutes or several hours energy replenishes whether or not players are logged into the game after energy is replenished players can engage in additional missions waiting for energy to replenish is a significant limiting factor in the games their support mechanisms take advantage of this zynga games are linked to offers from a number of partners players can accept credit card offers take surveys or buy services from zyngas partners in order to obtain game credits which would allow them to replenish their characters energy or receive premium currency that could be exchanged for other various virtual goods players may also purchase game credits directly from zynga via credit cards or paypal from within the game players can purchase the points for a fee us for  game credits for example in march  zynga started selling prepaid cards for virtual currency at more than  stores across the us zynga also sells advertising sponsorships within some games such as movie tieins and other brands in march  zynga announced it launched a separate

partnership with bwinparty an international realmoney gaming operator to launch realmoney gaming in the uk including the release of online poker a suite of  casino games and the first online farmvillebranded real money slots game during  the partnership opens up a potentially lucrative new revenue stream for zynga customer acquisitionedit customer acquisition is key to zyngas business zyngas customer acquisition was largely built on facebook initially and most of its new users came in through incentivized viral loops however in addition to viral acquisition zynga has also invested in paid marketing initially however when zynga was three or four people and they launched texas holdem on the brand new facebook platform they didnt spend any marketing dollars in recent times though facebook has been tightening up zyngas customer acquisition was perceived as spam by facebook and the new rules have limited the rate at which zynga can acquire users in general zynga owes a lot of its growth to incentivizing users to send invitations to their friends on the facebook platform however these incentives were usually artificial and not directly tied to the value proposition of the product as a result the indiscriminate usage of the virality that facebook offered led to users getting spammed resulting in a backlash from users overall zynga grew very fast but its marketing has always been expensive and it is now further threatened owing to its overdependence on facebook platinum purchase programedit in september  gawker reported that zynga had set up a platinum purchase program allowing members to purchase virtual currency in amounts over  at favorable rates by making a payment via wire transfer in contrast the normal maximum purchase limits are  to  as with other social game companies zynga depends on a small core of large spenders known within the industry as whales for a large part of its income ryan tate author of the post speculated that the program was a way for gaming addicts to feed their obsession and compared the secrecy of the program to the secrecy of drug deals viabilityedit many journalists have questioned the viability of zyngas business

writing for gamasutra said that zynga was at the end of the beginning noting that zyngas business model is dependent on facebook continuing to operate in the same manner and users continuing to expect the same quality of games among others kelly also compared zynga to atari which also churned out large numbers of simple games prior to the north american video game crash of  and further claimed that zyngas approach of creating similar clones of popular games would be impossible for deeper games tom bollich a former zynga investor said that it is impossible to make a cheap viral game and that retaining customers is difficult in an october  article in the wall street journal ben levisohn said that zynga has issues that could limit its upside such as its dependence on facebook and its reliance on a small percentage of users and a small number of games for most of its revenue in july  after announcing disappointing second quarter results some analysts speculated that the sale of virtual items may not be a longterm viable business model analyst richard greenfield downgraded zynga from buy to neutral in an article titled we are sorry and embarrassed by our mistake zynga executives have said the company is taking steps to turn its business around which includes introducing new web mobile and multiplayer games and developing a gambling game to be introduced outside the us the company is also working to increase advertising revenues which were up  percent in q  compared to the previous quarter and increased  percent year over year advertising “will likely become a crucial revenue stream for the company” according to ad age zynga was listed in the cnncom article the top  tech fails of  scam adsedit through  zynga made money from lead generation advertising schemes whereby game participants would earn game points by signing up for featured credit cards or videorental services these were criticized as being less costeffective than simply buying game points and in some cases being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription one ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted textmessaging services on october   michael arrington of techcrunch said that zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers and that lead generation made up a third of zyngas revenue arrington also alleged that facebook was complicit in this on november   former ceo mark pincus announced a reform in its offers tatto media a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions would be banned all mobile offers would be removed and offer providers would be required to prescreen offers arrington continued to question pincus role in the scams republishing a video of a speech by pincus in the speech pincus said so i funded zynga myself but i did every horrible thing in the book to just to get revenues right away i mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like i dont know i downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it laughs we did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business — mark pincus speech from startupberkeley in response pincus noted that after offering the zwinky toolbar his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a painful experience several days after the techcrunch story zyngas most recent facebook game fishville was temporarily taken offline by facebook on claim of advertising violations according to zynga fishville had  users within two days of launch a release from facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that fishville will remain suspended until facebook is satisfied that zynga demonstrates compliance with facebook restrictions – as well as zynga’s own restrictions – on the ads it offers users the fishville suspension was lifted less than  hours later several suits were filed against zynga for promoting such offers including the classaction lawsuit swift v zynga in the united states district court for the northern district of california for violation of the unfair competition law and the consumers legal remedies act after the lead plaintiffs credit card was billed more than  for offers she completed to receive yoville currency pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked the company removed all ads for a time relying only on direct purchase of game currency then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened corporate cultureedit zynga hq in  zynga started to move employees to new headquarters located in san franciscos south of market district where zynga had leased  out of  square feet of a sevenstory building zynga’s headquarters nicknamed “the dog house” features a coffee shop gaming

referred to as “zyngites” enjoy perks such as free gourmet meals access to an inhouse nutritionist personal training and insurance coverage for pets prior to the company’s  ipo zynga’s corporate culture received some negative media attention for renegotiating the equity packages of four senior employees those employees were required to either give up part of their nonvested stock or be fired although a san francisco employment lawyer said in the wall street journal that zyngas actions would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing no court has ruled on the issue since it has been rare for companies to demand nonvested stock as a condition of continued employment pincus later explained that zynga wanted to find them another position at the company versus just parting ways they had the option to leave and have a package as happened with some other leaders but we in addition to that offered them other positions at the company that came with different forward compensation zynga is reportedly known for having a highly competitive and stressful culture with long hours and relentless tracking of progress in another criticism in  an exemployee was cited quoting mark pincus as saying i dont fucking want innovation youre not smarter than your competitor just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers in november  the new york times reported that zynga “operates like a federation of citystates” with each of its games such as farmville and cityville run by autonomous teams this culture reportedly fostered “fierce internal competition” and caused some employees to complain about long hours and stressful deadlines two former senior zynga employees quoted anonymously by the times speculated that zynga’s corporate culture caused the company to lose a bid to acquire mobile game company popcap and nearly derailed its acquisition of myminilife which later developed the technology that is the basis for farmville at least one zynga employee said he planned to cash out and leave zynga after the ipo when asked about the criticisms zynga had received for its workplace environment ceo pincus said the company strives to be a meritocracy with a culture of leveling up through promotions pincus’s management philosophy is to “turn people into ceos” encouraging employees to identify and fully own “something really meaningful” to the company the ceos philosophy is part of the zynga meritocracy in which employees are rewarded for results pincus told the new york times the only way people will have the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their contribution is recognized and valued and if they see somebody else higher above them just because of a good résumé or they see somebody else promoted who they don’t think deserves it you’re done in a june  article on the forbes website zynga chief engineer kostadis roussos defended the company’s meritocracy culture writing that it attracts people who are “obsessed with business outcomes” rather than those enamored “with their own pet projects” joe raposo the quality assurance lead on cityville is also the bassist for southern california punk band lagwagon raposo praised procreativity culture in zynga saying i love working at zynga because they really support anything you do on the creative side and they nurture that while on tour with lagwagon raposo often works remotely for zynga over the summer of  the company lost a number of key executives in february  chief game designer brian reynolds discussed company culture positively

much as  percent after it had posted revenues of  million during its third quarter beating estimates of  million its revenue boost and stock price jump was a result of zyngas  million share buyback plan that the company decided to instill to help improve its recent stock price declines another factor included zyngas announcement that it was moving into realmoney gambling in the uk while acknowledging zynga’s continuing challenges such as slowing sales and its low stock price some analysts were more upbeat after the q  earnings than they had been after q  earnings were announced “every single thing that they are doing is what you would want them to do” said michael pachter an analyst with wedbush securities inc comparing q to q earnings conference calls journalists noted a change in former ceo pincus’ tone “instead of blaming an uncertain economy wandering consumer tastes or a weird alignment between jupiter and mars the former ceos message to wall street was clear blame us” wrote cnet in early  zynga former ceo mark pincus announced that farmville one of zyngas most popular games had reached  billion in total player bookings business modeledit zynga is supported in two manners via direct credit card payments and partner businesses several zynga games require an energy characteristic to play engaging in missions a core feature of many games consumes a certain amount of energy after expending energy it slowly replenishes to the characters maximum limit this can take minutes or several hours energy replenishes whether or not players are logged into the game after energy is replenished players can engage in additional missions waiting for energy to replenish is a significant limiting factor in the games their support mechanisms take advantage of this zynga games are linked to offers from a number of partners players can accept credit card offers take surveys or buy services from zyngas partners in order to obtain game credits which would allow them to replenish their characters energy or receive premium currency that could be exchanged for other various virtual goods players may also purchase game credits directly from zynga via credit cards or paypal from within the game players can purchase the points for a fee us for  game credits for example in march  zynga started selling prepaid cards for virtual currency at more than  stores across the us zynga also sells advertising sponsorships within some games such as movie tieins and other brands in march  zynga announced it launched a separate social gaming platform which will include publishing other developers to the new zyngacom platform early thirdparty developers include row sham bow inc and mobscience in june  zynga started running facebook advertisements and

an international realmoney gaming operator to launch realmoney gaming in the uk including the release of online poker a suite of  casino games and the first online farmvillebranded real money slots game during  the partnership opens up a potentially lucrative new revenue stream for zynga customer acquisitionedit customer acquisition is key to zyngas business zyngas customer acquisition was largely built on facebook initially and most of its new users came in through incentivized viral loops however in addition to viral acquisition zynga has also invested in paid marketing initially however when zynga was three or four people and they launched texas holdem on the brand new facebook platform they didnt spend any marketing dollars in recent times though facebook has been tightening up zyngas customer acquisition was perceived as spam by facebook and the new rules have limited the rate at which zynga can acquire users in general zynga owes a lot of its growth to incentivizing users to send invitations to their friends on the facebook platform however these incentives were usually artificial and not directly tied to the value proposition of the product as a result the indiscriminate usage of the virality that facebook offered led to users getting spammed resulting in a backlash from users overall zynga grew very fast but its marketing has always been expensive and it is now further threatened owing to its overdependence on facebook platinum purchase programedit in september  gawker reported that zynga had set up a platinum purchase program allowing members to purchase virtual currency in amounts over  at favorable rates by making a payment via wire transfer in contrast the normal maximum purchase limits are  to  as with other social game companies zynga depends on a small core of large spenders known within the industry as whales for a large part of its income ryan tate author of the post speculated that the program was a way for gaming addicts to feed their obsession and compared the secrecy of the program to the secrecy of drug deals viabilityedit many journalists have questioned the viability of zyngas business model ray valdes questioned the longterm prospects for zynga saying that it would be difficult for the company to make new titles to replace old ones whose novelty is fading in december  tadhg kelly writing for gamasutra said that zynga was at the end of the beginning noting that zyngas business model is dependent on facebook continuing to operate in the same manner and users continuing to expect the same quality of games among others kelly also compared zynga to atari which also churned out large numbers of simple games prior to the north american video game crash of  and further claimed that zyngas approach of creating similar clones of popular games would be impossible for deeper games tom bollich a former zynga investor said that it is impossible to make a cheap viral game and that retaining customers is difficult in an october  article in the wall street journal ben levisohn said that zynga has issues that could limit its upside such as its dependence on facebook and its reliance on a small percentage of users and a small number of games for most of its revenue in july  after announcing disappointing second quarter results some analysts speculated that the sale of virtual items may not be a longterm viable business model analyst richard greenfield downgraded zynga from buy to neutral in an article titled we are sorry and embarrassed by our mistake zynga executives have said the company is taking steps to turn its business around which includes introducing new web mobile and multiplayer games and developing a gambling game to be introduced outside the us the company is also working to increase advertising revenues which were up  percent in q  compared to the previous quarter and increased  percent year over year advertising “will likely become a crucial revenue stream for the company” according to ad age zynga was listed in the cnncom article the top  tech fails of  scam adsedit through  zynga made money from lead generation advertising schemes whereby game participants would earn game points by signing up for featured credit cards or videorental services these were criticized as being less costeffective than simply buying game points and in some cases being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription one ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted textmessaging services on october   michael arrington of techcrunch said that zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers and that lead generation made up a third of zyngas revenue arrington also alleged that facebook was complicit in this on november   former ceo mark pincus announced a reform in its offers tatto media a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions would be banned all mobile offers would be removed and offer providers would be required to prescreen offers arrington continued to question pincus role in the scams republishing a video of a speech by pincus in the speech pincus said so i funded zynga myself but i did every horrible thing in the book to just to get revenues right away i mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like i dont know i downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it laughs we did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business — mark pincus speech from startupberkeley in response pincus noted that after offering the zwinky toolbar his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a painful experience several days after the techcrunch story zyngas most recent facebook game fishville was temporarily taken offline by facebook on claim of advertising violations according to zynga fishville had  users within two days of launch a release from facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that fishville will remain suspended until facebook is satisfied that zynga demonstrates compliance with facebook restrictions – as well as zynga’s own restrictions – on the ads it offers users the fishville suspension was lifted less than  hours later several suits were filed against zynga for promoting such offers including the classaction lawsuit swift v zynga in the united states district court for the northern district of california for violation of the unfair competition law and the consumers legal remedies act after the lead plaintiffs credit card was billed more than  for offers she completed to receive yoville currency pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked the company removed all ads for a time relying only on direct purchase of game currency then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened corporate cultureedit zynga hq in  zynga started to move employees to new headquarters located in san franciscos south of market district where zynga had leased  out of  square feet of a sevenstory building zynga’s headquarters nicknamed “the dog house” features a coffee shop gaming arcade gym basketball court and wellness center at its san francisco headquarters zynga ceo pincuss goal was to create a playful gaming environment that evokes a fantasy land zynga employees also referred to as “zyngites” enjoy perks such as free gourmet meals access to an inhouse nutritionist personal training and insurance coverage for pets prior to the company’s  ipo zynga’s corporate culture received some negative media attention for renegotiating the equity packages of four senior employees those employees were required to either give up part of their nonvested stock or be fired although a san francisco employment lawyer said in the wall street journal that zyngas actions would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing no court has ruled on the issue since it has been rare for companies to demand nonvested stock as a condition of continued employment pincus later explained that zynga wanted to find them another position at the company versus just parting ways they had the option to leave and have a package as happened with some other leaders but we in addition to that offered them other positions at the company that came with different forward compensation zynga is reportedly known for having a highly competitive and stressful culture with long hours and relentless tracking of progress in another criticism in  an exemployee was cited quoting mark pincus as saying i dont fucking want innovation youre not smarter than your competitor just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers in november  the new york times reported that zynga “operates like a federation of citystates” with each of its games such as farmville and cityville run by autonomous teams this culture reportedly fostered “fierce internal competition” and caused some employees to complain about long hours and stressful deadlines two former senior zynga employees quoted anonymously by the times speculated that zynga’s corporate culture caused the company to lose a bid to acquire mobile game company popcap and nearly derailed its acquisition of myminilife which later developed the technology that is the basis for farmville at least one zynga employee said he planned to cash out and leave zynga after the ipo when asked about the criticisms zynga had received for its workplace environment ceo pincus said the company strives to be a meritocracy with a culture of leveling up through promotions pincus’s management philosophy is to “turn people into ceos” encouraging employees to identify and fully own “something really meaningful” to the company the ceos philosophy is part of the zynga meritocracy in which employees are rewarded for results pincus told the new york times the only way people will have the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their contribution is recognized and valued and if they see somebody else higher above them just because of a good résumé or they see somebody else promoted who they don’t think deserves it you’re done in a june  article on the forbes website zynga chief engineer kostadis roussos defended the company’s meritocracy culture writing that it attracts people who are “obsessed with business outcomes” rather than those enamored “with their own pet projects” joe raposo the quality assurance lead on cityville is also the bassist for southern california punk band lagwagon raposo praised procreativity culture in zynga saying i love working at zynga because they really support anything you do on the creative side and they nurture that while on tour with lagwagon raposo often works remotely for zynga over the summer of  the company lost a number of key executives in february  chief game designer brian reynolds discussed company culture positively in a post for venturebeat at the time of his exit from zynga saying the capability to absorb and adapt to change quickly is one of the great strengths of zynga’s culture – the true meaning of the motto and occasional battle cry zynga

they continue their partnership the exact percentage of this split has yet to be disclosed hasbro partnershipedit in february  it was announced that zynga and hasbro had partnered to create products based on zynga properties and brands in october  zynga and hasbro launched eight ‘facetoface’ games resulting from their collaboration farmville hungry hungry herd and animal games cityville monopoly

release of online poker a suite of  casino games and the first online farmvillebranded real money slots game during  the partnership opens up a potentially lucrative new revenue stream for zynga customer acquisitionedit customer acquisition is key to zyngas business zyngas customer acquisition was largely built on facebook initially and most of its new users came in through incentivized viral loops however in addition to viral acquisition zynga has also invested in paid marketing initially however when zynga was three or four people and they launched texas holdem on the brand new facebook platform they didnt spend any marketing dollars in recent times though facebook has been tightening up zyngas customer acquisition was perceived as spam by facebook and the new rules have limited the rate at which zynga can acquire users in general zynga owes a lot of its growth to incentivizing users to send invitations to their friends on the facebook platform however these incentives were usually artificial and not directly tied to the value proposition of the product as a result the indiscriminate usage of the virality that facebook offered led to users getting spammed resulting in a backlash from users overall zynga grew very fast but its marketing has always been expensive and it is now further threatened owing to its overdependence on facebook platinum purchase programedit in september  gawker reported that zynga had set up a platinum purchase program allowing members to purchase virtual currency in amounts over  at favorable rates by making a payment via wire transfer in contrast the normal maximum purchase limits are  to  as with other social game companies zynga depends on a small core of large spenders known within the industry as whales for a large part of its income ryan tate author of the post speculated that the program was a way for gaming addicts to feed their obsession and compared the secrecy of the program to the secrecy of drug deals viabilityedit many journalists have questioned the viability of zyngas business model ray valdes questioned the longterm prospects for zynga saying that it would be difficult for the company to make new titles to replace old ones whose novelty is fading in december  tadhg kelly writing for gamasutra said that zynga was at the end of the beginning noting that zyngas business model is dependent on facebook continuing to operate in the same manner and users continuing to expect the same quality of games among others kelly also compared zynga to atari which also churned out large numbers of simple games prior to the north american video game crash of  and further claimed that zyngas approach of creating similar clones of popular games would be impossible for deeper games tom bollich a former zynga investor said that it is impossible to make a cheap viral game and that retaining customers is difficult in an october  article in the wall street journal ben levisohn said that zynga has issues that could limit its upside such as its dependence on facebook and its reliance on a small percentage of users and a small number of games for most of its revenue in july  after announcing disappointing second quarter results some analysts speculated that the sale of virtual items may not be a longterm viable business model analyst richard greenfield downgraded zynga from buy to neutral in an article titled we are sorry and embarrassed by our mistake zynga executives have said the company is taking steps to turn its business around which includes introducing new web mobile and multiplayer games and developing a gambling game to be introduced outside the us the company is also working to increase advertising revenues which were up  percent in q  compared to the previous quarter and increased  percent year over year advertising “will likely become a crucial revenue stream for the company” according to ad age zynga was listed in the cnncom article the top  tech fails of  scam adsedit through  zynga made money from lead generation advertising schemes whereby game participants would earn game points by signing up for featured credit cards or videorental services these were criticized as being less costeffective than simply buying game points and in some cases being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription one ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted textmessaging services on october   michael arrington of techcrunch said that zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers and that lead generation made up a third of zyngas revenue arrington also alleged that facebook was complicit in this on november   former ceo mark pincus announced a reform in its offers tatto media a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions would be banned all mobile offers would be removed and offer providers would be required to prescreen offers arrington continued to question pincus role in the scams republishing a video of a speech by pincus in the speech pincus said so i funded zynga myself but i did every horrible thing in the book to just to get revenues right away i mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like i dont know i downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it laughs we did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business — mark pincus speech from startupberkeley in response pincus noted that after offering the zwinky toolbar his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a painful experience several days after the techcrunch story zyngas most recent facebook game fishville was temporarily taken offline by facebook on claim of advertising violations according to zynga fishville had  users within two days of launch a release from facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that fishville will remain suspended until facebook is satisfied that zynga demonstrates compliance with facebook restrictions – as well as zynga’s own restrictions – on the ads it offers users the fishville suspension was lifted less than  hours later several suits were filed against zynga for promoting such offers including the classaction lawsuit swift v zynga in the united states district court for the northern district of california for violation of the unfair competition law and the consumers legal remedies act after the lead plaintiffs credit card was billed more than  for offers she completed to receive yoville currency pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked the company removed all ads for a time relying only on direct purchase of game currency then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened corporate cultureedit zynga hq in  zynga started to move employees to new headquarters located in san franciscos south of market district where zynga had leased  out of  square feet of a sevenstory building zynga’s headquarters nicknamed “the dog house” features a coffee shop gaming arcade gym basketball court and wellness center at its san francisco headquarters zynga ceo pincuss goal was to create a playful gaming environment that evokes a fantasy land zynga employees also referred to as “zyngites” enjoy perks such as free gourmet meals access to an inhouse nutritionist personal training and insurance coverage for pets prior to the company’s  ipo zynga’s corporate culture received some negative media attention for renegotiating the equity packages of four senior employees those employees were required to either give up part of their nonvested stock or be fired although a san francisco employment lawyer said in the wall street journal that zyngas actions would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing no court has ruled on the issue since it has been rare for companies to demand nonvested stock as a condition of continued employment pincus later explained that zynga wanted to find them another position at the company versus just parting ways they had the option to leave and have a package as happened with some other leaders but we in addition to that offered them other positions at the company that came with different forward compensation zynga is reportedly known for having a highly competitive and stressful culture with long hours and relentless tracking of progress in another criticism in  an exemployee was cited quoting mark pincus as saying i dont fucking want innovation youre not smarter than your competitor just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers in november  the new york times reported that zynga “operates like a federation of citystates” with each of its games such as farmville and cityville run by autonomous teams this culture reportedly fostered “fierce internal competition” and caused some employees to complain about long hours and stressful deadlines two former senior zynga employees quoted anonymously by the times speculated that zynga’s corporate culture caused the company to lose a bid to acquire mobile game company popcap and nearly derailed its acquisition of myminilife which later developed the technology that is the basis for farmville at least one zynga employee said he planned to cash out and leave zynga after the ipo when asked about the criticisms zynga had received for its workplace environment ceo pincus said the company strives to be a meritocracy with a culture of leveling up through promotions pincus’s management philosophy is to “turn people into ceos” encouraging employees to identify and fully own “something really meaningful” to the company the ceos philosophy is part of the zynga meritocracy in which employees are rewarded for results pincus told the new york times the only way people will have the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their contribution is recognized and valued and if they see somebody else higher above them just because of a good résumé or they see somebody else promoted who they don’t think deserves it you’re done in a june  article on the forbes website zynga chief engineer kostadis roussos defended the company’s meritocracy culture writing that it attracts people who are “obsessed with business outcomes” rather than those enamored “with their own pet projects” joe raposo the quality assurance lead on cityville is also the bassist for southern california punk band lagwagon raposo praised procreativity culture in zynga saying i love working at zynga because they really support anything you do on the creative side and they nurture that while on tour with lagwagon raposo often works remotely for zynga over the summer of  the company lost a number of key executives in february  chief game designer brian reynolds

accounted for  percent of online game revenue total revenue was  million for the quarter ending march   zynga approached a billion dollars in revenue in four years since inception surpassing the

over year and reported that q bookings increased  percent year over year however the company also reported a net income loss of  million and reduced forecast for bookings for  from  billion to

important new game and several new games that didn’t meet expectations in late october  zyngas stock price increased as much as  percent after it had posted revenues of  million during its third quarter beating estimates of  million its revenue boost and stock price jump was a result of zyngas  million share buyback plan that the company decided to instill to help improve its recent stock price declines another factor included zyngas announcement that it was moving into realmoney gambling in the uk while acknowledging zynga’s continuing challenges such as slowing sales and its low stock price some analysts were more upbeat after the q  earnings than they had been after q  earnings were announced “every single thing that they are doing is what you would want them to do” said michael pachter an analyst with wedbush securities inc comparing q to q earnings conference calls journalists noted a change in former ceo pincus’ tone “instead of blaming an uncertain economy wandering consumer tastes or a weird alignment between jupiter and mars the former ceos message to wall street was clear blame us” wrote cnet in early  zynga former ceo mark pincus announced that farmville one of zyngas most popular games had reached  billion in total player bookings business modeledit zynga is supported in two manners via direct credit card payments and partner businesses several zynga games require an energy characteristic to play engaging in missions a core feature of many games consumes a certain amount of energy after expending energy it slowly replenishes to the characters maximum limit this can take minutes or several hours energy replenishes whether or not players are logged into the game after energy is replenished players can engage in additional missions waiting for energy to replenish is a significant limiting factor in the games their support mechanisms take advantage of this zynga games are linked to offers from a number of partners players can accept credit card offers take surveys or buy services from zyngas partners in order to obtain game credits which would allow them to replenish their characters energy or receive premium currency that could be exchanged for other various virtual goods players may also purchase game credits directly from zynga via credit cards or paypal from within the game players can purchase the points for a fee us for  game credits for example in march  zynga started selling prepaid cards for virtual currency at more than  stores across the us zynga also sells advertising sponsorships within some games such as movie tieins and other brands in march  zynga announced it launched a separate social gaming platform which will include publishing other developers to the new zyngacom platform early thirdparty developers include row sham bow inc and mobscience in june  zynga started running facebook advertisements and sponsored stories on its website the revenue is to be split between facebook and zynga as

and skies words with friends classic luxe to go and draw something the hasbro games include ties to zynga web and mobile games such as ingame currency that players can use in the digital versions of cityville and farmville realmoney gamingedit in october  zynga announced a partnership with bwinparty an international realmoney gaming operator to launch realmoney gaming in the uk including the release of online poker a suite of  casino games and the first online farmvillebranded real money slots game during  the partnership opens up a potentially lucrative new revenue stream for zynga customer acquisitionedit customer acquisition is key to zyngas business zyngas customer acquisition was largely built on facebook initially and most of its new users came in through incentivized viral loops however in addition to viral acquisition zynga has also invested in paid marketing initially however when zynga was three or four people and they launched texas holdem on the brand new facebook platform they didnt spend any marketing dollars in recent times though facebook has been tightening up zyngas customer acquisition was perceived as spam by facebook and the new rules have limited the rate at which zynga can acquire users in general zynga owes a lot of its growth to incentivizing users to send invitations to their friends on the facebook platform however these incentives were usually artificial and not directly tied to the value proposition of the product as a result the indiscriminate usage of the virality that facebook offered led to users getting spammed resulting in a backlash from users overall zynga grew very fast but its marketing has always been expensive and it is now further threatened owing to its overdependence on facebook platinum purchase programedit in september  gawker reported that zynga had set up a platinum purchase program allowing members to purchase virtual currency in amounts over  at favorable rates by making a payment via wire transfer in contrast the normal maximum purchase limits are  to  as with other social game companies zynga depends on a small core of large spenders known within the industry as whales for a large part of its income ryan tate author of the post speculated that the program was a way for gaming addicts to feed their obsession and compared the secrecy of the program to the secrecy of drug deals viabilityedit many journalists have questioned the viability of zyngas business model ray valdes questioned the longterm prospects for zynga saying that it would be difficult for the company to make new titles to replace old ones whose novelty is fading in december  tadhg kelly writing for gamasutra said that zynga was at the end of the beginning noting that zyngas business model is dependent on facebook continuing to operate in the same manner and users continuing to expect the same quality of games among others kelly also compared zynga to atari which also churned out large numbers of simple games prior to the north american video game crash of  and further claimed that zyngas approach of creating similar clones of popular games would be impossible for deeper games tom bollich a former zynga investor said that it is impossible to make a cheap viral game and that retaining customers is difficult in an october  article in the wall street journal ben levisohn said that zynga has issues that could limit its upside such as its dependence on facebook and its reliance on a small percentage of users and a small number of games for most of its revenue in july  after announcing disappointing second quarter results some analysts speculated that the sale of virtual items may not be a longterm viable business model analyst richard greenfield downgraded zynga from buy to neutral in an article titled we are sorry and embarrassed by our mistake zynga executives have said the company is taking steps to turn its business around which includes introducing new web mobile and multiplayer games and developing a gambling game to be introduced outside the us the company is also working to increase advertising revenues which were up  percent in q  compared to the previous quarter and increased  percent year over year advertising “will likely become a crucial revenue stream for the company” according to ad age zynga was listed in the cnncom article the top  tech fails of  scam adsedit through  zynga made money from lead generation advertising schemes whereby game participants would earn game points by signing up for featured credit cards or videorental services these were criticized as being less costeffective than simply buying game points and in some cases being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription one ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted textmessaging services on october   michael arrington of techcrunch said that zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers and that lead generation made up a third of zyngas revenue arrington also alleged that facebook was complicit in this on november   former ceo mark pincus announced a reform in its offers tatto media a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions would be banned all mobile offers would be removed and offer providers would be required to prescreen offers arrington continued to question pincus role in the scams republishing a video of a speech by pincus in the speech pincus said so i funded zynga myself but i did every horrible thing in the book to just to get revenues right away i mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like i dont know i downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it laughs we did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business — mark pincus speech from startupberkeley in response pincus noted that after offering the zwinky toolbar his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a painful experience several days after the techcrunch story zyngas most recent facebook game fishville was temporarily taken offline by facebook on claim of advertising violations according to zynga fishville had  users within two days of launch a release from facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that fishville will remain suspended until facebook is satisfied that zynga demonstrates compliance with facebook restrictions – as well as zynga’s own restrictions – on the ads it offers users the fishville suspension was lifted less than  hours later several suits were filed against zynga for promoting such offers including the classaction lawsuit swift v zynga in the united states district court for the northern district of california for violation of the unfair competition law and the consumers legal remedies act after the lead plaintiffs credit card was billed more than  for offers she completed to receive yoville currency pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked the company removed all ads for a time relying only on direct purchase of game currency then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened corporate cultureedit zynga hq in  zynga started to move employees to new headquarters located in san franciscos south of market district where zynga had leased  out of  square feet of a sevenstory building zynga’s headquarters nicknamed “the dog house” features a coffee shop gaming arcade gym basketball court and wellness center at its san francisco headquarters zynga ceo pincuss goal was to create a playful gaming environment that evokes a fantasy land zynga employees also referred to as “zyngites” enjoy perks such as free gourmet meals access to an inhouse nutritionist personal training and insurance coverage for pets prior to the company’s  ipo zynga’s corporate culture received some negative media attention for renegotiating the equity packages of four senior employees those employees were required to either give up part of their nonvested stock or be fired although a san francisco employment lawyer said in the wall street journal that zyngas actions would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing no court has ruled on the issue since it has been rare for companies to demand nonvested stock as a condition of continued employment pincus later explained that zynga wanted to find them another position at the company versus just parting ways they had the option to leave and have a package as happened with some other leaders but we in addition to that offered them other positions at the company that came with different forward compensation zynga is reportedly known for having a highly competitive and stressful culture with long hours and relentless tracking of progress in another criticism in  an exemployee was cited quoting mark pincus as saying i dont fucking want innovation youre not smarter than your competitor just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers in november  the new york times reported that zynga “operates like a federation of citystates” with each of its games such as farmville and cityville run by autonomous teams this culture reportedly fostered “fierce internal competition” and caused some employees to complain about long hours and stressful deadlines two former senior zynga employees quoted anonymously by the times speculated that zynga’s corporate culture caused the company to lose a bid to acquire mobile game company popcap and nearly derailed its acquisition of myminilife which later developed the technology that is the basis for farmville at least one zynga employee said he planned to cash out and leave zynga after the ipo when asked about the criticisms zynga had received for its workplace environment ceo pincus said the company strives to be a meritocracy with a culture of leveling up through promotions pincus’s management philosophy is to “turn people into ceos” encouraging employees to identify and fully own “something really meaningful” to the company the ceos philosophy is part of the zynga meritocracy in which employees are rewarded for results pincus told the new york times the only way people will have the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their contribution is recognized and valued and if they see somebody else higher above them just because of a good résumé or

important new game and several new games that didn’t meet expectations in late october  zyngas stock price increased as much as  percent after it had posted revenues of  million during its third quarter beating estimates of  million its revenue boost and stock price jump was a result of zyngas  million share buyback plan that the company decided to instill to help improve its recent stock price declines another factor included zyngas announcement that it was moving into realmoney gambling in the uk while acknowledging zynga’s continuing challenges such as slowing sales and its low stock price some analysts were more upbeat after the q  earnings than they had been after q  earnings were announced “every single thing that they are doing is what you would want them to do” said michael pachter an analyst with wedbush securities inc comparing q to q earnings conference calls journalists noted a change in former ceo pincus’ tone “instead of blaming an uncertain economy wandering consumer tastes or a weird alignment between jupiter and mars the former ceos message to wall street was clear blame us” wrote cnet in early  zynga former ceo mark pincus announced that farmville one of zyngas most popular games had reached  billion in total player bookings business modeledit zynga is supported in two manners via direct credit card payments and partner businesses several zynga games require an energy characteristic to play engaging in missions a core feature of many games consumes a certain amount of energy after expending energy it slowly replenishes to the characters maximum limit this can take minutes or several hours energy replenishes whether or not players are logged into the game after energy is replenished players can engage in additional missions waiting for energy to replenish is a significant limiting factor in the games their support mechanisms take advantage of this zynga games are linked to offers from a number of partners players can accept credit card offers take surveys or buy services from zyngas partners in order to obtain game credits which would allow them to replenish their characters energy or receive premium currency that could be exchanged for other various virtual goods players may also purchase game credits directly from zynga via credit cards or paypal from within the game players can purchase the points for a fee us for  game credits for example in march  zynga started selling prepaid cards for virtual currency at more than  stores across the us zynga also sells advertising sponsorships within some games such

release of online poker a suite of  casino games and the first online farmvillebranded real money slots game during  the partnership opens up a potentially lucrative new revenue stream for zynga customer acquisitionedit customer acquisition is key to zyngas business zyngas customer acquisition was largely built on facebook initially and most of its new users came in through incentivized viral loops however in addition to viral acquisition zynga has also invested in paid marketing initially however when zynga was three or four people and they launched texas holdem on the brand new facebook platform they didnt spend any marketing dollars in recent times though facebook has been tightening up zyngas customer acquisition was perceived as spam by facebook and the new rules have limited the rate at which zynga can acquire users in general zynga owes a lot of its growth to incentivizing users to send invitations to their friends on the facebook platform however these incentives were usually artificial and not directly tied to the value proposition of the product as a result the indiscriminate usage of the virality that facebook offered led to users getting spammed resulting in a backlash from users overall zynga grew very fast but its marketing has always been expensive and it is now further threatened owing to its overdependence on facebook platinum purchase programedit in september  gawker reported that zynga had set up a platinum purchase program allowing members to purchase virtual currency in amounts over  at favorable rates by making a payment via wire transfer in contrast the normal maximum purchase limits are  to  as with other social game companies zynga depends on a small core of large spenders known within the industry as whales for a large part of its income ryan tate author of the post speculated that the program was a way for gaming addicts to feed their obsession and compared the secrecy of the program to the secrecy of drug deals viabilityedit

replace old ones whose novelty is fading in december  tadhg kelly writing for gamasutra said that zynga was at the end of the beginning noting that zyngas business model is dependent on facebook continuing to operate in the same manner and users continuing to expect the same quality of games among others kelly also compared zynga to atari which also churned out large numbers of simple games prior to the north american video game crash of  and further claimed that zyngas approach of creating similar clones of popular games would be impossible for deeper games tom bollich a former zynga investor said that it is impossible to make a cheap viral game and that retaining customers is difficult in an october  article in the wall street journal ben levisohn said that zynga has issues that could limit its upside such as its dependence on facebook and its reliance on a small percentage of users and a small number of games for most of its revenue in july  after announcing disappointing second quarter results some analysts speculated that the sale of virtual items may not be a longterm viable business model analyst richard greenfield downgraded zynga from buy to neutral in an article titled we are sorry and embarrassed by our mistake zynga executives have said the company is taking steps to turn its business around which includes introducing new web mobile and multiplayer games and developing a gambling game to be introduced outside the us the company is also working to increase advertising revenues which were up  percent in q  compared to the previous quarter and increased  percent year over year advertising “will likely become a crucial revenue stream for the company” according to ad age zynga was listed in the cnncom article the top  tech fails of  scam adsedit through  zynga made money from lead generation advertising schemes whereby game participants would earn game points by signing up for featured credit cards or videorental services these were criticized as being less costeffective than simply buying game points and in some cases being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription one ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted textmessaging services on october   michael arrington of techcrunch said that zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers and that lead generation made up a third of zyngas revenue arrington also alleged that facebook was complicit in this on november   former ceo mark pincus announced a reform in its offers tatto media a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions would be banned all mobile offers would be removed and offer providers would be required to prescreen offers arrington continued to question pincus role in the scams republishing a video of a speech by pincus in the speech pincus said so i funded zynga myself but i did every horrible thing in the book to just to get revenues right away i mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like i dont know i downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it laughs we did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business — mark pincus speech from startupberkeley in response pincus noted that after offering the zwinky toolbar his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a painful experience several days after the techcrunch story zyngas most recent facebook game fishville was temporarily taken offline by facebook on claim of advertising violations according to zynga fishville had  users within two days of launch a release from facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that fishville will remain suspended until facebook is satisfied that zynga demonstrates compliance with facebook restrictions – as well as zynga’s own restrictions – on the ads it offers users the fishville suspension was lifted less than  hours later several suits were filed against zynga for promoting such offers including the classaction lawsuit swift v zynga in the united states district court for the northern district of california for violation of the unfair competition law and the consumers legal remedies act after the lead plaintiffs credit card was billed more than  for offers she completed to receive yoville currency pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked the company removed all ads for a time relying only on direct purchase of game currency then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened corporate cultureedit zynga hq in  zynga started to move employees to new headquarters located in san franciscos south of market district where zynga had leased  out of  square feet of a sevenstory building zynga’s headquarters nicknamed “the dog house” features a coffee shop gaming arcade gym basketball court and wellness center at its san francisco headquarters zynga ceo pincuss goal was to create a playful gaming environment that evokes a fantasy land zynga employees also referred to as “zyngites” enjoy perks such as free gourmet meals access to an inhouse nutritionist personal training and insurance coverage for pets prior to the company’s  ipo zynga’s corporate culture received some negative media attention for renegotiating the equity packages of four senior employees those employees were required to either give up part of their nonvested stock or be fired although a san francisco employment lawyer said in the wall street journal that zyngas actions would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing no court has ruled on the issue since it has been rare for companies to demand nonvested stock as a condition of continued employment pincus later explained that zynga wanted to find them another position at the company versus just parting ways they had the option to leave and have a package as happened with some other leaders but we in addition to that offered them other positions at the company that came with different forward compensation zynga is reportedly known for having a highly competitive and stressful culture with long hours and relentless tracking of progress in another criticism in  an exemployee was cited quoting mark pincus as saying i dont fucking want innovation youre not smarter than your competitor just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers in november  the new york times reported that zynga “operates like a federation of citystates” with each of its games such as farmville and cityville run by autonomous teams this culture reportedly fostered “fierce internal competition” and caused some employees to complain about long hours and stressful deadlines two former senior zynga employees quoted anonymously by the times speculated that zynga’s corporate culture caused the company to lose a bid to acquire mobile game company popcap and nearly derailed its acquisition of myminilife which later developed the technology that is the basis for farmville at least one zynga employee said he planned to cash out and leave zynga after the ipo when asked about the criticisms zynga had received for its workplace environment ceo pincus said the company strives to be a meritocracy with a culture of leveling up through promotions pincus’s management philosophy is to “turn people into ceos” encouraging employees to identify and fully own “something really meaningful” to the company the ceos philosophy is part of the zynga meritocracy in which employees are rewarded for results pincus told the new york times the only way people will have the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their contribution is recognized and valued and if they see somebody else higher above them just because of a good résumé or they see somebody else promoted who they don’t think deserves it you’re done in a june  article on the forbes website zynga chief engineer kostadis roussos defended the company’s meritocracy culture writing that it attracts people who are “obsessed with business outcomes” rather than those enamored “with their own pet projects” joe raposo the quality assurance lead on cityville is also the bassist for southern california punk band lagwagon raposo praised procreativity culture in zynga saying i love working at zynga because they really support anything you do on the creative side and they nurture that while on tour with lagwagon raposo often works remotely for zynga over the summer of  the company lost a number of key executives in february  chief game designer brian reynolds

accounted for  percent of online game revenue total revenue was  million for the quarter ending march   zynga approached a billion dollars in revenue in four years since inception surpassing the market value of the longtime console game company electronic arts zyngas rapid growth has been seen as an indicator of the vastly different playing field from only a few years before where games have

over year and reported that q bookings increased  percent year over year however the company also reported a net income loss of  million and reduced forecast for bookings for  from  billion to

important new game and several new games that didn’t meet expectations in late october  zyngas stock price increased as much as  percent after it had posted revenues of  million during its third quarter beating estimates of  million its revenue boost and stock price jump was a result of zyngas  million share buyback plan that the company decided to instill to help improve its recent stock price declines another factor included zyngas announcement that it was moving into realmoney gambling in the uk while acknowledging zynga’s continuing challenges such as slowing sales and its low stock price some analysts were more upbeat after the q  earnings than they had been after q  earnings were announced “every single thing that they are doing is what you would want them to do” said michael pachter an analyst with wedbush securities inc comparing q to q earnings conference calls journalists noted a change in former ceo pincus’ tone “instead of blaming an uncertain economy wandering consumer tastes or a weird alignment between jupiter and mars the former ceos message to wall street was clear blame us” wrote cnet in early  zynga former ceo mark pincus announced that farmville one of zyngas most popular games had reached  billion in total player bookings business modeledit zynga is supported in two manners via direct credit card payments and partner businesses several zynga games require an energy characteristic to play engaging in missions a core feature of many games consumes a certain amount of energy after expending energy it slowly replenishes to the characters maximum limit this can take minutes or several hours energy replenishes whether or not players are logged into the game after energy is replenished players can engage in additional missions waiting for energy to replenish is a significant limiting factor in the games their support mechanisms take advantage of this zynga games are linked to offers from a number of partners players can accept credit card offers take surveys or buy services from zyngas partners in order to obtain game credits which would allow them to replenish their characters energy or receive premium currency that could be exchanged for other various virtual goods players may also purchase game credits directly from zynga via credit cards or paypal from within the game players can purchase the points for a fee us for  game credits for example in march  zynga started selling prepaid cards for virtual currency at more than  stores across the us zynga also sells advertising sponsorships within some games such as movie tieins and other brands in march  zynga announced it launched a separate social gaming platform which will include publishing other developers to the new zyngacom platform early thirdparty developers include row sham bow inc and mobscience in june  zynga started running facebook advertisements and sponsored stories on its website the revenue is to be split between facebook and zynga as they continue their partnership the exact percentage of this split has yet to be disclosed hasbro partnershipedit in february  it was announced that zynga and hasbro had partnered to create products based on zynga properties and brands in october  zynga and hasbro launched eight ‘facetoface’ games resulting from their collaboration farmville hungry hungry herd and animal games cityville monopoly

cityville and farmville realmoney gamingedit in october  zynga announced a partnership with bwinparty an international realmoney gaming operator to launch realmoney gaming in the uk including the release of online poker a suite of  casino games and the first online farmvillebranded real money slots game during  the partnership opens up a potentially lucrative new revenue stream for zynga customer acquisitionedit customer acquisition is key to zyngas business zyngas customer acquisition was largely built on facebook initially and most of its new users came in through incentivized viral loops however in addition to viral acquisition zynga has also invested in paid marketing initially however when zynga was three or four people and they launched texas holdem on the brand new facebook platform they didnt spend any marketing dollars in recent times though facebook has been tightening up zyngas customer acquisition was perceived as spam by facebook and the new rules have limited the rate at which zynga can acquire users in general zynga owes a lot of its growth to incentivizing users to send invitations to their friends on the facebook platform however these incentives were usually artificial and not directly tied to the value proposition of the product as a result the indiscriminate usage of the virality that facebook offered led to users getting spammed resulting in a backlash from users overall zynga grew very fast but its marketing has always been expensive and it is now further threatened owing to its overdependence on facebook platinum purchase programedit in september  gawker reported that zynga had set up a platinum purchase program allowing members to purchase virtual currency in amounts over  at favorable rates by making a payment via wire transfer in contrast the normal maximum purchase limits are  to  as with other social game companies zynga depends on a small core of large spenders known within the industry as whales for a large part of its income ryan tate author of the post speculated that the program was a way for gaming addicts to feed their obsession and compared the secrecy of the program to the secrecy of drug deals viabilityedit many journalists have questioned the viability of zyngas business model ray valdes questioned the longterm prospects for zynga saying that it would be difficult for the company to make new titles to replace old ones whose novelty is fading in december  tadhg kelly writing for gamasutra said that zynga was at the end of the beginning noting that zyngas business model is dependent on facebook continuing to operate in the same manner and users continuing to expect the same quality of games among others kelly also compared zynga to atari which also churned out large numbers of simple games prior to the north american video game crash of  and further claimed that zyngas approach of creating similar clones of popular games would be impossible for deeper games tom bollich a former zynga investor said that it is impossible to make a cheap viral game and that retaining customers is difficult in an october  article in the wall street journal ben levisohn said that zynga has issues that could limit its upside such as its dependence on facebook and its reliance on a small percentage of users and a small number of games for most of its revenue in july  after announcing disappointing second quarter results some analysts speculated that the sale of virtual items may not be a longterm viable business model analyst richard greenfield downgraded zynga from buy to neutral in an article titled we are sorry and embarrassed by our mistake zynga executives have said the company is taking steps to turn its business around which includes introducing new web mobile and multiplayer games and developing a gambling game to be introduced outside the us the company is also working to increase advertising revenues which were up  percent in q  compared to the previous quarter and increased  percent year over year advertising “will likely become a crucial revenue stream for the company” according to ad age zynga was listed in the cnncom article the top  tech fails of  scam adsedit through  zynga made money from lead generation advertising schemes whereby game participants would earn game points by signing up for featured credit cards or videorental services these were criticized as being less costeffective than simply buying game points and in some cases being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription one ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted textmessaging services on october   michael arrington of techcrunch said that zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers and that lead generation made up a third of zyngas revenue arrington also alleged that facebook was complicit in this on november   former ceo mark pincus announced a reform in its offers tatto media a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions would be banned all mobile offers would be removed and offer providers would be required to prescreen offers arrington continued to question pincus role in the scams republishing a video of a speech by pincus in the speech pincus said so i funded zynga myself but i did every horrible thing in the book to just to get revenues right away i mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like i dont know i downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it laughs we did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business — mark pincus speech from startupberkeley in response pincus noted that after offering the zwinky toolbar his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a painful experience several days after the techcrunch story zyngas most recent facebook game fishville was temporarily taken offline by facebook on claim of advertising violations according to zynga fishville had  users within two days of launch a release from facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that fishville will remain suspended until facebook is satisfied that zynga demonstrates compliance with facebook restrictions – as well as zynga’s own restrictions – on the ads it offers users the fishville suspension was lifted less than  hours later several suits were filed against zynga for promoting such offers including the classaction lawsuit swift v zynga in the united states district court for the northern district of california for violation of the unfair competition law and the consumers legal remedies act after the lead plaintiffs credit card was billed more than  for offers she completed to receive yoville currency pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked the company removed all ads for a time relying only on direct purchase of game currency then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened corporate cultureedit zynga hq in  zynga started to move employees to new headquarters located in san franciscos south of market district where zynga had leased  out of  square feet of a sevenstory building zynga’s headquarters nicknamed “the dog house” features a coffee shop gaming arcade gym basketball court and wellness center at its san francisco headquarters zynga ceo pincuss goal was to create a playful gaming environment that evokes a fantasy land zynga employees also referred to as “zyngites” enjoy perks such as free gourmet meals access to an inhouse nutritionist personal training and insurance coverage for pets prior to the company’s  ipo zynga’s corporate culture received some negative media attention for renegotiating the equity packages of four senior employees those employees were required to either give up part of their nonvested stock or be fired although a san francisco employment lawyer said in the wall street journal that zyngas actions would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing no court has ruled on the issue since it has been rare for companies to demand nonvested stock as a condition of continued employment pincus later explained that zynga wanted to find them another position at the company versus just parting ways they had the option to leave and have a package as happened with some other leaders but we in addition to that offered them other positions at the company that came with different forward compensation zynga is reportedly known for having a highly competitive and stressful culture with long hours and relentless tracking of progress in another criticism in  an exemployee was cited quoting mark pincus as saying i dont fucking want innovation youre not smarter than your competitor just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers in november  the new york times reported that zynga “operates like a federation of citystates” with each of its games such as farmville and cityville run by autonomous teams this culture reportedly fostered “fierce internal competition” and caused some employees to complain about long hours and stressful deadlines two former senior zynga employees quoted anonymously by the times speculated that zynga’s corporate culture caused the company to lose a bid to acquire mobile game company popcap and nearly derailed its acquisition of myminilife which later developed the technology that is the basis for farmville at least one zynga employee said he planned to cash out and leave zynga after the ipo when asked about the criticisms zynga had received for its workplace environment ceo pincus said the company strives to be a meritocracy with a culture of leveling up through promotions pincus’s management philosophy is to “turn people into ceos” encouraging employees to identify and fully own “something really meaningful” to the company the ceos philosophy is part of the zynga meritocracy in which employees are rewarded for results pincus told the new york times the only way people will have the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their contribution is recognized and valued and if they see somebody else higher above them just because of a good résumé or they see somebody else promoted who they don’t think deserves it you’re done in a june  article on the forbes website zynga chief engineer kostadis roussos defended the company’s meritocracy culture writing that it attracts people who are “obsessed with business outcomes” rather than those enamored “with their own pet projects” joe raposo the quality assurance lead on cityville is also the bassist for southern california punk band lagwagon raposo praised procreativity culture in zynga saying i love working at zynga because they really support anything you do on the creative side and they nurture that while on tour with lagwagon raposo often works remotely for zynga over the summer of  the company lost a number of key executives in february  chief game designer brian reynolds discussed company culture positively in a post for venturebeat at the time of his exit from zynga saying the capability to absorb and adapt to change quickly is one of the great strengths of zynga’s culture – the true meaning of the motto and occasional battle cry zynga speed among other comments relationship with facebookedit on july   zynga filed an addendum to its form s detailing its

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime

much as  percent after it had posted revenues of  million during its third quarter beating estimates of  million its revenue boost and stock price jump was a result of zyngas  million share buyback plan that the company decided to instill to help improve its recent stock price declines another factor included zyngas announcement that it was moving into realmoney gambling in the uk while acknowledging zynga’s continuing challenges such as slowing sales and its low stock price some analysts were more upbeat after the q  earnings than they had been after q  earnings were announced “every single thing that they are doing is what you would want them to do” said michael pachter an analyst with wedbush securities inc comparing q to q earnings conference calls journalists noted a change in former ceo pincus’ tone “instead of blaming an uncertain economy wandering consumer tastes or a weird alignment between jupiter and mars the former ceos message to wall street was clear blame us” wrote cnet in early  zynga former ceo mark pincus announced that farmville one of zyngas most popular games had reached  billion in total player bookings business modeledit zynga is supported in two manners via direct credit card payments and partner businesses several zynga games require an energy characteristic to play engaging in missions a core feature of many games consumes a certain amount of energy after expending energy it slowly replenishes to the characters maximum limit this can take minutes or several hours energy replenishes whether or not players are logged into the game after energy is replenished players can engage in additional missions waiting for energy to replenish is a significant limiting factor in the games their support mechanisms take advantage of this zynga games are linked to offers from a number of partners players can accept credit card offers take surveys or buy services from zyngas partners in order to obtain game credits which would allow them to replenish their characters energy or receive premium currency that could be exchanged for other various virtual goods players may also purchase game credits directly from zynga via credit cards or paypal from within the game players can purchase the points for a fee us for  game credits for example in march  zynga started selling prepaid cards for virtual currency at more than  stores across the us zynga also sells advertising sponsorships within some games such as movie tieins and other brands in march  zynga announced it launched a separate social gaming platform which

an international realmoney gaming operator to launch realmoney gaming in the uk including the release of online poker a suite of  casino games and the first online farmvillebranded real money slots game during  the partnership opens up a potentially lucrative new revenue stream for zynga customer acquisitionedit customer acquisition is key to zyngas business zyngas customer acquisition was largely built on facebook initially and most of its new users came in through incentivized viral loops however in addition to viral acquisition zynga has also invested in paid marketing initially however when zynga was three or four people and they launched texas holdem on the brand new facebook platform they didnt spend any marketing dollars in recent times though facebook has been tightening up zyngas customer acquisition was perceived as spam by facebook and the new rules have limited the rate at which zynga can acquire users in general zynga owes a lot of its growth to incentivizing users to send invitations to their friends on the facebook platform however these incentives were usually artificial and not directly tied to the value proposition of the product as a result the indiscriminate usage of the virality that facebook offered led to users getting spammed resulting in a backlash from users overall zynga grew very fast but its marketing has always been expensive and it is now further threatened owing to its overdependence on facebook platinum purchase programedit in september  gawker reported that zynga had set up a platinum purchase program allowing members to purchase virtual currency in amounts over  at favorable rates by making a payment via wire transfer in contrast the normal maximum purchase limits are  to  as with other social game companies zynga depends on a small core of large spenders known within the industry as whales for a large part of its income ryan tate author of the post speculated that the program was a way for gaming addicts to feed their obsession and compared the secrecy of the program to the secrecy of drug deals viabilityedit many journalists have questioned the viability of zyngas business model ray valdes questioned the longterm prospects for zynga saying that it would be difficult for the company to make new titles to replace old ones whose novelty is fading in december  tadhg kelly writing for gamasutra said that zynga was at the end of the beginning noting that zyngas business model is dependent on facebook continuing to operate in the same manner and users continuing to expect the same quality of games among others kelly also compared zynga to atari which also churned out large numbers of simple games prior to the north american video game crash of  and further claimed that zyngas approach of creating similar clones of popular games would be impossible for deeper games tom bollich a former zynga investor said that it is impossible to make a cheap viral game and that retaining customers is difficult in an october  article in the wall street journal ben levisohn said that zynga has issues that could limit its upside such as its dependence on facebook and its reliance on a small percentage of users and a small number of games for most of its revenue in july  after announcing disappointing second quarter results some analysts speculated that the sale of virtual items may not be a longterm viable business model analyst richard greenfield downgraded zynga from buy to neutral in an article titled we are sorry and embarrassed by our mistake zynga executives have said the company is taking steps to turn its business around which includes introducing new web mobile and multiplayer games and developing a gambling game to be introduced outside the us the company is also working to increase advertising revenues which were up  percent in q  compared to the previous quarter and increased  percent year over year advertising “will likely become a crucial revenue stream for the company” according to ad age zynga was listed in the cnncom article the top  tech fails of  scam adsedit through  zynga made money from lead generation advertising schemes whereby game participants would earn game points by signing up for featured credit cards or videorental services these were criticized as being less costeffective than simply buying game points and in some cases being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription one ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted textmessaging services on october   michael arrington of techcrunch said that zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers and that lead generation made up a third of zyngas revenue arrington also alleged that facebook was complicit in this on november   former ceo mark pincus announced a reform in its offers tatto media a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions would be banned all mobile offers would be removed and offer providers would be required to prescreen offers arrington continued to question pincus role in the scams republishing a video of a speech by pincus in the speech pincus said so i funded zynga myself but i did every horrible thing in the book to just to get revenues right away i mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like i dont know i downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it laughs we did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business — mark pincus speech from startupberkeley in response pincus noted that after offering the zwinky toolbar his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a painful experience several days after the techcrunch story zyngas most recent facebook game fishville was temporarily taken offline by facebook on claim of advertising violations according to zynga fishville had  users within two days of launch a release from facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that fishville will remain suspended until facebook is satisfied that zynga demonstrates compliance with facebook restrictions – as well as zynga’s own restrictions – on the ads it offers users the fishville suspension was lifted less than  hours later several suits were filed against zynga for promoting such offers including the classaction lawsuit swift v zynga in the united states district court for the northern district of california for violation of the unfair competition law and the consumers legal remedies act after the lead plaintiffs credit card was billed more than  for offers she completed to receive yoville currency pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked the company removed all ads for a time relying only on direct purchase of game currency then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened corporate cultureedit zynga hq in  zynga started to move employees to new headquarters located in san franciscos south of market district where zynga had leased  out of  square feet of a sevenstory building zynga’s headquarters nicknamed “the dog house” features a coffee shop gaming arcade gym basketball court and wellness center at its san francisco headquarters zynga ceo pincuss goal was to create a playful gaming environment that evokes a fantasy land zynga employees also referred to as “zyngites” enjoy perks such as free gourmet meals access to an inhouse nutritionist personal training and insurance coverage for pets prior to the company’s  ipo zynga’s corporate culture received some negative media attention for renegotiating the equity packages of four senior employees those employees were required to either give up part of their nonvested stock or be fired although a san francisco employment lawyer said in the wall street journal that zyngas actions would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing no court has ruled on the issue since it has been rare for companies to demand nonvested stock as a condition of continued employment pincus later explained that zynga wanted to find them another position at the company versus just parting ways they had the option to leave and have a package as happened with some other leaders but we in addition to that offered them other positions at the company that came with different forward compensation zynga is reportedly known for having a highly competitive and stressful culture with long hours and relentless tracking of progress in another criticism in  an exemployee was cited quoting mark pincus as saying i dont fucking want innovation youre not smarter than your competitor just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers in november  the new york times reported that zynga “operates like a federation of citystates” with each of its games such as farmville and cityville run by autonomous teams this culture reportedly fostered “fierce internal competition” and caused some employees to complain about long hours and stressful deadlines two former senior zynga employees quoted anonymously by the times speculated that zynga’s corporate culture caused the company to lose a bid to acquire mobile game company popcap and nearly derailed its acquisition of myminilife which later developed the technology that is the basis for farmville at least one zynga employee said he planned to cash out and leave zynga after the ipo when asked about the criticisms zynga had received for its workplace environment ceo pincus said the company strives to be a meritocracy with a culture of leveling up through promotions pincus’s management philosophy is to “turn people into ceos” encouraging employees to identify and fully own “something really meaningful” to the company the ceos philosophy is part of the zynga meritocracy in which employees are rewarded for results pincus told the new york times the only way people will have the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their contribution is recognized and valued and if they see somebody else higher above them just because of a good résumé or they see somebody else promoted who they don’t think deserves it you’re done in a june  article on the forbes website zynga chief engineer kostadis roussos defended the company’s meritocracy culture writing that it attracts people who are “obsessed with business outcomes” rather than those enamored “with their own pet projects” joe raposo the quality assurance lead on cityville is also the bassist for southern california punk band lagwagon raposo praised procreativity culture in zynga saying i love working at zynga because they really support anything you do on the creative side and they nurture that while on tour with lagwagon raposo often works remotely for zynga over the summer of  the company lost a number of key executives in february  chief game designer brian reynolds discussed company culture positively in a post for venturebeat at the time of his exit from zynga saying the capability to absorb and adapt to change quickly is one of the great strengths of zynga’s culture – the true meaning of the motto and occasional battle cry zynga

farmville one of zyngas most popular games had reached  billion in total player bookings business modeledit zynga is supported in two manners via direct credit card payments and partner businesses several zynga games require an energy characteristic to play engaging in missions a core feature of many games consumes a certain amount of energy after expending energy it slowly replenishes to the characters maximum limit this can take minutes or several hours energy replenishes whether or not players are logged into the game after energy is replenished players can engage in additional missions waiting for energy to replenish is a significant limiting factor in the games their support mechanisms take advantage of this zynga games are linked to offers from a number of partners players can accept credit card offers take surveys or buy services from zyngas partners in order to obtain game credits which would allow them to replenish their characters energy or receive premium currency that could be exchanged for other various virtual goods players may also purchase game credits directly from zynga via credit cards or paypal from within the game players can purchase the points for a fee us for  game credits for example in march  zynga started selling prepaid cards for virtual currency at more than  stores across the us zynga also sells advertising sponsorships within some games such as movie tieins and other brands in march  zynga announced it launched a separate social gaming platform which will include publishing other developers to the new zyngacom platform early thirdparty developers include row sham bow inc and mobscience in june  zynga started running facebook advertisements and sponsored stories on its website the revenue is to be split between facebook and zynga as they continue their partnership the exact percentage of this split has yet to be disclosed hasbro partnershipedit in february  it was announced that zynga and hasbro had partnered to create products based on zynga properties and brands in october  zynga and hasbro launched eight ‘facetoface’ games resulting from their collaboration farmville hungry hungry herd and animal games cityville monopoly and skies words with friends classic luxe to go and draw something the hasbro games include ties to zynga web and mobile games such as ingame currency that players can use in the digital versions of cityville and farmville realmoney gamingedit in october  zynga announced a partnership with bwinparty an international realmoney gaming operator to launch realmoney gaming in the uk including the release of online poker a suite of  casino games and the first online farmvillebranded real money slots game during  the partnership opens up a potentially lucrative new revenue stream for zynga customer acquisitionedit customer acquisition is key to zyngas business zyngas customer acquisition was largely built on facebook initially and most of its new users came in through incentivized viral loops however in addition to viral acquisition zynga has also invested in paid marketing initially however when zynga was three or four people and they launched texas holdem on the brand new facebook platform they didnt spend any marketing dollars in recent times though facebook has been tightening up zyngas customer acquisition was perceived as spam by facebook and the new rules have limited the rate at which zynga can acquire users in general zynga owes a lot of its growth to incentivizing users to send invitations to their friends on the facebook platform however these incentives were usually artificial and not directly tied to the value proposition of the product as a result the indiscriminate usage of the virality that facebook offered led to users getting spammed resulting in a backlash from users overall zynga grew very fast but its marketing has always been expensive and it is now further threatened owing to its overdependence on facebook platinum purchase programedit in september  gawker reported that zynga had set up a platinum purchase program allowing members to purchase virtual currency in amounts over  at favorable rates by making a payment via wire transfer in contrast the normal maximum purchase limits are  to  as with other social game companies zynga depends on a small core of large spenders known within the industry as whales for a large part of its income ryan tate author of the post speculated that the program was a way for gaming addicts to feed their obsession and compared the secrecy of the program to the secrecy of drug deals viabilityedit many journalists have questioned the viability of zyngas business model ray valdes questioned the longterm prospects for zynga saying that it would be difficult for the company to make new titles to replace old ones whose novelty is fading in december  tadhg kelly writing for gamasutra said that zynga was at the end of the beginning noting that zyngas business model is dependent on facebook continuing to operate in the same manner and users continuing to expect the same quality of games among others kelly also compared zynga to atari which also churned out large numbers of simple games prior to the north american video game crash of  and further claimed that zyngas approach of creating similar clones of popular games would be impossible for deeper games tom bollich a former zynga investor said that it is impossible to make a cheap viral game and that retaining customers is difficult in an october  article in the wall street journal ben levisohn said that zynga has issues that could limit its upside such as its dependence on facebook and its reliance on a small percentage of users and a small number of games for most of its revenue in july  after announcing disappointing second quarter results some analysts speculated that the sale of virtual items may not be a longterm viable business model analyst richard greenfield downgraded zynga from buy to neutral in an article titled we are sorry and embarrassed by our mistake zynga executives have said the company is taking steps to turn its business around which includes introducing new web mobile and multiplayer games and developing a gambling game to be introduced outside the us the company is also working to increase advertising revenues which were up  percent in q  compared to the previous quarter and increased  percent year over year advertising “will likely become a crucial revenue stream for the company” according to ad age zynga was listed in the cnncom article the top  tech fails of  scam adsedit through  zynga made money from lead generation advertising schemes whereby game participants would earn game points by signing up for featured credit cards or videorental services these were criticized as being less costeffective than simply buying game points and in some cases being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription one ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted textmessaging services on october   michael arrington of techcrunch said that zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers and that lead generation made up a third of zyngas revenue arrington also alleged that facebook was complicit in this on november   former ceo mark pincus announced a reform in its offers tatto media a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions would be banned all mobile offers would be removed and offer providers would be required to prescreen offers arrington continued to question pincus role in the scams republishing a video of a speech by pincus in the speech pincus said so i funded zynga myself but i did every horrible thing in the book to just to get revenues right away i mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like i dont know i downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it laughs we did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business — mark pincus speech from startupberkeley in response pincus noted that after offering the zwinky toolbar his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a painful experience several days after the techcrunch story zyngas most recent facebook game fishville was temporarily taken offline by facebook on claim of advertising violations according to zynga fishville had  users within two days of launch a release from facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that fishville will remain suspended until facebook is satisfied that zynga demonstrates compliance with facebook restrictions – as well as zynga’s own restrictions – on the ads it offers users the fishville suspension was lifted less than  hours later several suits were filed against zynga for promoting such offers including the classaction lawsuit swift v zynga in the united states district court for the northern district of california for violation of the unfair competition law and the consumers legal remedies act after the lead plaintiffs credit card was billed more than  for offers she completed to receive yoville currency pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked the company removed all ads for a time relying only on direct purchase of game currency then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened corporate cultureedit zynga hq in  zynga started to move employees to new headquarters located in san franciscos south of market district where zynga had leased  out of  square feet of a sevenstory building zynga’s headquarters nicknamed “the dog house” features a coffee shop gaming arcade gym basketball court and wellness center at its san francisco headquarters zynga ceo pincuss goal was to create a playful gaming environment that evokes a fantasy land zynga employees also referred to as “zyngites” enjoy perks such as free gourmet meals access to an inhouse nutritionist personal training and insurance coverage for pets prior to the company’s  ipo zynga’s corporate culture received some negative media attention for renegotiating the equity packages of four senior employees those employees were required to either give up part of their nonvested stock or be fired although a san francisco employment lawyer said in the wall street journal that zyngas actions would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing no court has ruled on the issue since it has been rare for companies to demand nonvested stock as a condition of continued employment pincus later explained that zynga wanted to find them another position at the company versus just parting ways they had the option to leave and have a package as happened with some other leaders but we in addition to that offered them other positions at the company that came with different forward compensation zynga is reportedly known for having a highly competitive and stressful culture with long hours and relentless tracking of progress in another criticism in  an exemployee was cited quoting mark pincus as saying i dont fucking want innovation youre not smarter than your competitor just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers in november  the new york times reported that zynga “operates like a federation of citystates” with each of its games such as farmville and cityville run by autonomous teams this culture reportedly fostered “fierce internal competition” and caused some employees to complain about long hours and stressful deadlines two former senior zynga employees quoted anonymously by the times speculated that zynga’s corporate culture caused the company to lose a bid to acquire mobile game company popcap and nearly derailed its acquisition of myminilife which later developed the technology that is the basis for farmville at least one zynga employee said he planned to cash out and leave zynga after the ipo when asked about the criticisms zynga had received for its workplace environment ceo pincus said the company strives to be a meritocracy with a culture of leveling up through promotions pincus’s management philosophy is to “turn people into ceos” encouraging employees to identify and fully own “something really meaningful” to the company the ceos philosophy is part of the zynga meritocracy in which employees are rewarded for results pincus told the new york times the only way people will have the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their contribution is recognized and valued and if they see somebody else higher above them just because of a good résumé or they see somebody else promoted who they don’t think deserves it you’re done in a june  article on the forbes website zynga chief engineer kostadis roussos defended the company’s meritocracy culture writing that it attracts people who are “obsessed with business outcomes” rather than those enamored “with their own pet projects” joe raposo the quality assurance lead on cityville is also the bassist for southern california punk band lagwagon raposo praised procreativity culture in zynga saying i love working at zynga because they really support anything you do on the creative side and they nurture that while on tour with lagwagon raposo often works remotely for zynga over the summer of  the company lost a number of key executives in february  chief game designer brian reynolds discussed company culture positively in a post for venturebeat at the time of his exit from zynga saying the capability to absorb and adapt to change quickly is one of the great strengths of zynga’s culture – the true meaning of the motto and occasional battle cry zynga speed among other comments relationship with facebookedit on july   zynga filed an addendum to its form s detailing its

important new game and several new games that didn’t meet expectations in late october  zyngas stock price increased as much as  percent after it had posted revenues of  million during its third quarter beating estimates of  million its revenue boost and stock price jump was a result of zyngas  million share buyback plan that the company decided to instill to help improve its recent stock price declines another factor included zyngas announcement that it was moving into realmoney gambling in the uk while acknowledging zynga’s continuing challenges such as slowing sales and its low stock price some analysts were more upbeat after the q  earnings than they had been after q  earnings were announced “every single thing that they are doing is what you would want them to do” said michael pachter an analyst with wedbush securities inc comparing q to q earnings conference calls journalists noted a change in former ceo pincus’ tone “instead of blaming an uncertain economy wandering consumer tastes or a weird alignment between jupiter and mars the former ceos message to wall street was clear blame us” wrote cnet in early  zynga former ceo mark pincus announced that farmville one of zyngas most popular games had reached  billion in total player bookings business modeledit zynga is supported in two manners via direct credit card payments and partner businesses several zynga games require an energy characteristic to play engaging in missions a core feature of many games consumes a certain amount of energy after expending energy it slowly replenishes to the characters maximum limit this can take minutes or several hours energy replenishes whether or not players are logged into the game after energy is replenished players can engage in additional missions waiting for energy to replenish is a significant limiting factor in the games their support mechanisms take advantage of this zynga games are linked to offers from a number of partners players can accept credit card offers take surveys or buy services from zyngas partners in order to obtain game credits which would allow them to replenish their characters energy or receive premium currency that could be exchanged for other various virtual goods players may also purchase game credits directly from zynga via credit cards or paypal from within the game players can purchase the points for a fee us for  game credits for example in march  zynga started selling prepaid cards for virtual currency at more than  stores across the us zynga also sells advertising sponsorships within some games such as movie tieins and other brands in march  zynga announced it launched a separate social gaming platform which will include publishing other developers to the new zyngacom platform early thirdparty developers include row sham bow inc and mobscience in june  zynga started running facebook advertisements and sponsored stories on its website the revenue is to be split between facebook and zynga as

and skies words with friends classic luxe to go and draw something the hasbro games include ties to zynga web and mobile games such as ingame currency that players can use in the digital versions of cityville and farmville realmoney gamingedit in october  zynga announced a partnership with bwinparty an international realmoney gaming operator to launch realmoney gaming in the uk including the release of online poker a suite of  casino games and the first online farmvillebranded real money slots game during  the partnership opens up a potentially lucrative new revenue stream for zynga customer acquisitionedit customer acquisition is key to zyngas business zyngas customer acquisition was largely built on facebook initially and most of its new users came in through incentivized viral loops however in addition to viral acquisition zynga has also invested in paid marketing initially however when zynga was three or four people and they launched texas holdem on the brand new facebook platform they didnt spend any marketing dollars in recent times though facebook has been tightening up zyngas customer acquisition was perceived as spam by facebook and the new rules have limited the rate at which zynga can acquire users in general zynga owes a lot of its growth to incentivizing users to send invitations to their friends on the facebook platform however these incentives were usually artificial and not directly tied to the value proposition of the product as a result the indiscriminate usage of the virality that facebook offered led to users getting spammed resulting in a backlash from users overall zynga grew very fast but its marketing has always been expensive and it is now further threatened owing to its overdependence on facebook platinum purchase programedit in september  gawker reported that zynga had set up a platinum purchase program allowing members to purchase virtual currency in amounts over  at favorable rates by making a payment via wire transfer in contrast the normal maximum purchase limits are  to  as with other social game companies zynga depends on a small core of large spenders known within the industry as whales for a large part of its income ryan tate author of the post speculated that the program was a way for gaming addicts to feed their obsession and compared the secrecy of the program to the secrecy of drug deals viabilityedit many journalists have questioned the viability of zyngas business model ray valdes questioned the longterm prospects for zynga saying that it would be difficult for the company to make new titles to replace old ones whose novelty is fading in december  tadhg kelly writing for gamasutra said that zynga was at the end of the beginning noting that zyngas business model is dependent on facebook continuing to operate in the same manner and users continuing to expect the same quality of games among others kelly also compared zynga to atari which also churned out large numbers of simple games prior to the north american video game crash of  and further claimed that zyngas approach of creating similar clones of popular games would be impossible for deeper games tom bollich a former zynga investor said that it is impossible to make a cheap viral game and that retaining customers is difficult in an october  article in the wall street journal ben levisohn said that zynga has issues that could limit its upside such as its dependence on facebook and its reliance on a small percentage of users and a small number of games for most of its revenue in july  after announcing disappointing second quarter results some analysts speculated that the sale of virtual items may not be a longterm viable business model analyst richard greenfield downgraded zynga from buy to neutral in an article titled we are sorry and embarrassed by our mistake zynga executives have said the company is taking steps to turn its business around which includes introducing new web mobile and multiplayer games and developing a gambling game to be introduced outside the us the company is also working to increase advertising revenues which were up  percent in q  compared to the previous quarter and increased  percent year over year advertising “will likely become a crucial revenue stream for the company” according to ad age zynga was listed in the cnncom article the top  tech fails of  scam adsedit through  zynga made money from lead generation advertising schemes whereby game participants would earn game points by signing up for featured credit cards or videorental services these were criticized as being less costeffective than simply buying game points and in some cases being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription one ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted textmessaging services on october   michael arrington of techcrunch said that zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers and that lead generation made up a third of zyngas revenue arrington also alleged that facebook was complicit in this on november   former ceo mark pincus announced a reform in its offers tatto media a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions would be banned all mobile offers would be removed and offer providers would be required to prescreen offers arrington continued to question pincus role in the scams republishing a video of a speech by pincus in the speech pincus said so i funded zynga myself but i did every horrible thing in the book to just to get revenues right away i mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like i dont know i downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it laughs we did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business — mark pincus speech from startupberkeley in response pincus noted that after offering the zwinky toolbar his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a painful experience several days after the techcrunch story zyngas most recent facebook game fishville was temporarily taken offline by facebook on claim of advertising violations according to zynga fishville had  users within two days of launch a release from facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that fishville will remain suspended until facebook is satisfied that zynga demonstrates compliance with facebook restrictions – as well as zynga’s own restrictions – on the ads it offers users the fishville suspension was lifted less than  hours later several suits were filed against zynga for promoting such offers including the classaction lawsuit swift v zynga in the united states district court for the northern district of california for violation of the unfair competition law and the consumers legal remedies act after the lead plaintiffs credit card was billed more than  for offers she completed to receive yoville currency pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked the company removed all ads for a time relying only on direct purchase of game currency then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened corporate cultureedit zynga hq in  zynga started

fantasy land zynga employees also referred to as “zyngites” enjoy perks such as free gourmet meals access to an inhouse nutritionist personal training and insurance coverage for pets prior to the company’s  ipo zynga’s corporate culture received some negative media attention for renegotiating the equity packages of four senior employees those employees were required to either give up part of their nonvested stock or be fired although a san francisco employment lawyer said in the wall street journal that zyngas actions would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing no court has ruled on the issue since it has been rare for companies to demand nonvested stock as a condition of continued employment pincus later explained that zynga wanted to find them another position at the company versus just parting ways they had the option to leave and have a package as happened with some other leaders but we in addition to that offered them other positions at the company that came with different forward compensation zynga is reportedly known for having a highly competitive and stressful culture with long hours and relentless tracking of progress in another criticism in  an exemployee was cited quoting mark pincus as saying i dont fucking want innovation youre not smarter than your competitor just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers in november  the new york times reported that zynga “operates like a federation of citystates” with each of its games such as farmville and cityville run by autonomous teams this culture reportedly fostered “fierce internal competition” and caused some employees to complain about long hours and stressful deadlines two former senior zynga employees quoted anonymously by the times speculated that zynga’s corporate culture caused the company to lose a bid to acquire mobile game company popcap and nearly derailed its acquisition of myminilife which later developed the technology that is the basis for farmville at least one zynga employee said he planned to cash out and leave zynga after the ipo when asked about the criticisms zynga had received for its workplace environment ceo pincus said the company strives to be a meritocracy with a culture of leveling up through promotions pincus’s management philosophy is to “turn people into ceos” encouraging employees to identify and fully own “something really meaningful” to the company the ceos philosophy is part of the zynga meritocracy in which employees are rewarded for results pincus told the new york times the only way people will have the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their contribution is recognized and valued and if they see somebody else higher above them just because of a good résumé or they see somebody else promoted who they don’t think deserves it you’re done in a june  article on the forbes website zynga chief engineer kostadis roussos defended the company’s meritocracy culture writing that it attracts people who are “obsessed with business outcomes” rather than those enamored “with their own pet projects” joe raposo the quality assurance lead on cityville is also the bassist for southern california punk band lagwagon raposo praised procreativity culture in zynga saying i love working at zynga because they really support anything you do on the creative side and they nurture that while on tour with lagwagon raposo often works remotely for zynga over the summer of  the company lost a number of key executives in february  chief game designer brian reynolds
