huffington post   pm et  updated nov   derek peterson terra tech founder ditched wall street for marijuana business by janean chun k  as far as derek peterson sees it wall street cant compete with the marijuana business after a decade in investment banking in late  peterson learned that a friends marijuana dispensary was clearing  million a year dwarfing petersons  to  annual salary at morgan stanley the place was the size of a starbucks and had about  patients a day said peterson now  i was a finance guy always analyzing different industries i started looking at the products and services utilized in this industry the economics behind it and how i could prosper from a peripheral business peterson launched growop technology in may  as a side business selling plug and play mobile hydroponic trailers equipped with everything necessary to grow medical marijuana morgan stanley fired him seven months later for his pot side business  unfairly peterson claims he said saw many of his colleagues running side businesses morgan stanley smith barney believes it treated mr peterson fairly and appropriately including in its application of its wellestablished policy requiring disclosure and approval of outside business activities a morgan stanley smith barney spokeswoman told the huffington post rather than joining another wall street firm peterson decided to get serious about weed through one of growops investors peterson had the opportunity in february  to merge with terra tech corp a publiclytraded firm that was getting out of the voice ip industry besides selling hydroponic trailers for  to  his company makes hydroponic equipment acquiring smaller retailers and creating new technology including an iphone app that allows growers to monitor crops remotely terra tech projects  revenues of more than  million huffpost small business recently asked peterson what its like to go from wall street to weed were you anxious leaving wall street to enter such a risky industry it was frightening i had a billion second thoughts i spent  years building up to where i was and was walking away from periodic sevenfigure bonuses benefits expense accounts and perks to run my own company living off my savings but i had a conversation with my family and with my wife behind me i jumped in and started kicking with both feet what did your peers on wall street think for the most part everyone was excited there was a lot of press at the time around the green rush so they understood there was a market opportunity but i could tell they thought i was crazy for leaving the comfort of wall street for me it was more important to make some sort of impact create some jobs and actually contribute to society in some small way what wall street principles did you want to apply to the medical marijuana industry i saw a fragmented industry and knew it was a good opportunity for mergers and acquisitions for the consolidation of momandpop shops that didnt have an exit strategy or ability to monetize the first and simplest concept i brought was economies of scale youve got a thousand different retailers all buying at standard price so by forming a buying group you could compete for better pricing were going for complete vertical integration to try to amalgamate the industry was it difficult to break into a business in which the players werent necessarily familiar with these principles its a cultural industry in which people are congealed by loyalty and dont want outsiders coming in and shaking things up too much we found it was easier for us to present the opportunity to bigger chains that had business acumen besides the inside adjustments do you feel the outside pressure of being in a controversial industry i never wanted to get involved with the plant directly because of state and federal laws if we owned a dispensary that would be a different ballgame but we do a good job of keeping it at arms length we sell hydroponic equipment to cultivate products whether thats food or cannabis so we havent felt any pushback as dispensaries close weve even seen an uptick as patients come to companies like us to cultivate their own medicine at the end of the day patients who are going to consume are going to consume theres demand for the product whether its a white market black market or gray market are you motivated by personal as well as professional reasons i broke my neck five years ago in a surfing accident i landed head first on a sandbar and in the hospital they put me on this painkiller you feel unbelievable when youre on it but its the worst withdrawal ever i started utilizing cannabis not only in smokable form but in creams for my back so im a huge proponent from understanding firsthand its efficacy and lack of side effects i find it frustrating as an entrepreneur when the economy is in the state its in watching businesses creating fulltime wellpaying fully benefited jobs shut down by the feds its difficult for me to wrap my head around why its not taxed regulated and legalized i dont understand why were pushing it in the opposite direction right now whats your vision for your company to continue with ma expand our product lineups and integrate technology weve made an environmental controller where farmers can control the cycle of cultivation turn lights on and off monitor co levels temperature and dehumidifiers from an iphone or ipad if they get a perfect crop they can pull that data off the digital control and replicate it for the next crop increased technology can make indoor cannabis growing more environmentally friendly as well as add value to agriculture given the droughts and our fragmented food distribution system you want to change the industry with innovative technology that could also have mainstream applications that change the way we live so youre kind of like the steve jobs of weed wow i hope so entrepreneur spotlight name derek petersoncompany growop technology merged into
