assets invested in the subaccounts are charged with the annual operating expenses of the portfolios  each insurance company applicant will recapture credit enhancements if the owner returns the contract for a refund during the free look period the free look period is  days or such longer period as may be required under state law the insurance company applicants will not seek to recapture credit enhancements under any other circumstance  the free look period is the period during which an owner may return a contract after it has been delivered and receive a full refund of the contract value less any credit enhancements no other charges will apply to the refund but the owner bears the investment risk from the time of purchase until he or she returns the contract the owner also will bear any expenses charged with respect to the credit enhancement amount incurred prior to return of the contract eg any mortality and expense risk charge the refund amount may be more or less than the purchase payment the owner made unless state insurance law requires that the full amount of the purchase payment be refunded  applicants seek relief pursuant to section c from sections a and ia of the  act and rule c thereunder to the extent necessary i to permit lincoln benefit glenbrook and allstate life to recapture an amount equal to the credit enhancements when an owner returns a contract or future contract for a refund during the “free look” period in which case the issuing insurance company applicant will recover the amount of any credit enhancement applicable to such contribution and ii to permit all of the insurance company applicants to recapture credit enhancements under future contracts insurance company applicants may issue through the separate accounts applicants or through future accounts that contain credit enhancement features including recapture provisions that are substantially similar in all material respects to the contracts applicants also request that the order being sought extend to any affiliated brokerdealer that serves as a distributor or principal underwriter for contracts or future start printed page contracts offered through the separate account applicants or any future account applicants legal analysis  section c the  act authorizes the commission to exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from the provisions of the  act and the rules promulgated thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act applicants believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  applicants represent that it is not administratively feasible to track the credit enhancement amount in the subaccounts after the credit enhancement is applied accordingly the assetbased charges applicable to the subaccounts will be assessed against the entire amounts held in the subaccounts including the credit enhancement amount during the “free look” period as a result during such period the aggregate assetbased charges assessed against an owners annuity account value will be higher than those that would be charged if the owners contract value did not include the credit enhancements  subsection i of section  provides that section  does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account except as provided in paragraph  of the subsection paragraph  provides that it shall be unlawful for any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or a sponsoring insurance company of such account to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless among other things such contract is a redeemable security section a defines “redeemable security” as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof  applicants submit that the credit enhancement recapture provisions of the contracts would not deprive an owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets applicants state that an owners interest in the credit enhancement amount allocated to his or her contract value upon receipt of an initial purchase payment is not vested until the applicable freelook period has expired without return of the contract until the free look period has expired and any credit enhancement amount is vested applicants submit that the issuing insurance company applicant retains the right and interest in the credit enhancement amount although not in the earnings attributable to that amount thus applicants argue that when an insurance company applicant recaptures any credit enhancement it is merely retrieving its own assets and the owner has not been deprived of a proportionate share of the separate accounts assets  in addition applicants state that permitting an owner to retain a credit enhancement under a contract upon the exercise of the free look period would not only be unfair but would also encourage individuals to purchase a contract with no intention of keeping it but simply to return it for a quick profit  applicants state that the credit enhancement will be attractive to and in the interest of investors because it will permit owners to put either  under credit enhancement option  of glenbrooks contracts or  under lincolns and allstate lifes contracts and credit enhancement option  of glenbrooks contract of their purchase payments to work for them in the selected subaccounts in addition the owner will retain any earnings attributable to the credit enhancement as well as the principal amount of the credit enhancement if he or she does not cancel the contract  applicants submit that the provisions for recapture of any credit enhancement under the contracts do not and any such future contract provisions will not violate section a and ia of the  act nevertheless to avoid any uncertainties applicants request an exemption from those sections to the extent deemed necessary to permit the recapture of any credit enhancements under the circumstances described herein with respect to the contracts and any future contracts without the loss of the relief from section  provided by section i  section c of the  act authorizes the commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company whether or not members of any securities association to the same extent covering the same subject matter and for the accomplishment of the same ends as are prescribed in section a rule c thereunder prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security  arguably the recapture of a credit enhancement might be viewed as resulting in the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the separate account applicants contend however that recapture does not involve either of the evils that rule c was intended to eliminate or reduce namely i the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or their redemption or repurchase at a price above it and ii other unfair results including speculative trading practices to effect a recapture of a credit enhancement the issuing insurance company applicant will redeem an owners interest in a subaccount at a price determined on the basis of current net asset value of the subaccount the amount recaptured will equal the amount of the credit enhancements paid out of its general account assets although the owner will be entitled to retain any investment gain attributable to the credit enhancement the amount of such gain will be determined on the basis of the current net asset value of the relevant subaccounts thus no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the credit enhancement applicants also submit that the second harm that rule c was designed to address namely speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of the recapture of the credit however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the  act applicants request an exemption from the provisions of rule c to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the credit enhancements start printed page under the contracts and future contracts  applicants submit that their request for an order which applies to future accounts established by the insurance company applicants and future contracts that are substantially similar in all material respects to the contracts described herein is appropriate in the public interest applicants state that such an order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications in the future thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of applicants resources applicants state that requiring them to file additional applications would impair their ability effectively to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise and that investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection by requiring applicants to repeatedly seek exemptive relief that would present no issue under the  act that has not already been addressed in this application conclusion applicants submit that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in section c of the  act namely that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and that therefore the commission should grant the requested order start signature

voting stockholders of the merging companies moreover none of the events affecting the northbrook separate accounts in connection with the merger require a vote of northbrook contract owners under the  act in addition as described above the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the northbrook contracts will not change except that allstate will become the depositor of the

under the transferred northbrook contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the northbrook contracts currently being offered but for the change in depositor allstate will administer the northbrook contracts in the same manner as did northbrook immediately prior to the merger all costs of the merger will be borne by allstate or an affiliate and not by any owners of northbrook or allstate contracts each a contract owner and collectively the contract owners b the separate account transfer pursuant to the merger agreement northbrook life separate account will transfer intact to allstate and become part of allstate on the effective date it will change its name to allstate life variable life separate account a and have allstate as its depositor rather than northbrook no other changes to northbrook life separate account will result from the merger the assets and liabilities that comprise northbrook life separate account immediately prior to the merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of allstate as the surviving company after the merger in addition northbrook life separate account will continue to fund the same contracts it did immediately prior to the merger c the separate account mergers pursuant to the merger agreement the northbrook va accounts will merge with allstate separate account i on the effective date to achieve administrative efficiencies and cost savings allstate will consolidate any duplicative subaccounts that invest in the same underlying fund the consolidation of the subaccounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each northbrook contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging subaccounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving subaccount the values of the exchanged interests under the contracts will thus be equivalent the accumulation unit values for these subaccounts will not change and the contract value of any affected contract owner immediately after the subaccount consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the subaccount consolidation the separate account mergers will not affect the subaccounts of the northbrook separate accounts that are not duplicative those subaccounts will remain intact within allstate separate account i and their net asset values immediately after the merger will be the same as they were immediately before the merger d the fixed account transfer pursuant to the merger agreement northbrook will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the northbrook mva contracts to allstate and allstate will assume northbrooks obligations under such contracts on the effective date as a result of the merger each nonunitized separate account of northbrook that funds the northbrook mva contracts will become a nonunitized separate account of allstate at the same time allstate will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of northbrook and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of northbrook under the northbrook mva contracts issued prior to the merger the fixed account transfer will not change the terms of the northbrook mva contracts except for the succession of allstate as the insurer under the northbrook mva contracts and it will not adversely affect the values determined under or the economic interests of the owners of those contracts e procedural matters allstate will file new registration statements on form n or form n as applicable under the  act to reflect the change in depositor of the northbrook separate accounts and allstates assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of northbrook under the northbrook va contracts and northbrook vli contract allstate will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date existing northbrook contract owners other than northbrook vli contract owners will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects allstates sponsorship of the northbrook separate accounts as a result of the merger new contract owners will receive a revised prospectus that reflects the change in depositor northbrook vli contract owners will receive a new form n prospectus that reflects the change in depositor allstate also will file new registration statements on form s under the  act for the northbrook mva contracts allstate will seek to have the registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date these new registration statements would reflect allstates assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of northbrook with respect to the northbrook mva contracts pursuant to the merger each person who owns a northbrook mva contract at the time of the fixed account transfer will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects allstate as the issuer of the contract new contract owners will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer in compliance with applicable state law allstate and northbrook will notify the owners of the northbrook contracts that allstate has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of northbrook under those contracts following the effective date allstate will not make offers or accept purchase payments under the northbrook contracts until the new registration statements filed with the commission are effective iii discussion for the reasons discussed below we are of the view that section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the proposed transactions we also are of the view as discussed below that section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer and that section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer or the separate account mergers finally we are of the view that the exemptive relief previously granted to northbrook and other named parties prior to the merger may continue to be relied upon after the merger by allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and the other named parties without the need for the filing or submission of amended or duplicative exemptive applications the staff has responded favorably to noaction requests dealing with the provisions of the  act and the  act noted above regarding transactions similar to the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer we respectfully submit that the proposed transactions are analogous to and pose no different issues than those presented in the transactions described in those noaction requests a section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the separate account transfer the separate account mergers or the fixed account transfer  separate account transfer in our view the separate account transfer would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of section  of the  act and rule  thereunder the separate account transfer would not change the northbrook vli contracts except that by operation of law allstate would succeed northbrook as the depositor of northbrook life separate account and coissuer of the contracts and would accordingly guarantee the rights and benefits provided by the contracts these rights and benefits eg surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc would remain the same but would be guaranteed directly by allstates larger pool of assets cash values under the northbrook vli contracts that are allocated to the northbrook life separate account would remain funded by the same pool of assets that presently constitutes the separate account and its subaccounts would continue to invest in the same underlying funds the unit values under the northbrook vli contracts offered by allstate life variable life separate account a immediately after the separate account transfer would be the same as under the contracts offered by northbrook life separate account immediately before the separate account transfer therefore would not affect those aspects of the northbrook vli contracts that cause interests thereunder to be treated as securities eg the investment options available through the separate account the separate account transfer would have no effect on the northbrook life separate account except for the succession of allstate as depositor and coissuer described above and except for the change in name of that separate account to allstate life variable life separate account a the assets and liabilities that comprise the northbrook life separate account immediately before the separate account transfer would remain intact and legally segregated from all other business of allstate the financial history of the northbrook life separate account would be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by allstate would not change as discussed above contract owners will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the merger including the separate account transfer and will not by virtue of the merger have available any new or different investment options consequently contract owners will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the separate account transfer based on the foregoing we believe that section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the separate account transfer  separate account mergers in our view the separate account mergers would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act and rule  thereunder the separate account mergers would not result in any change to the northbrook va contracts except that allstate would succeed northbrook as depositor and as coissuer of the contracts the rights and benefits under the northbrook va contracts would remain the same all of the subaccounts of the northbrook va accounts would continue to invest in the same underlying funds the northbrook va contract values immediately following the merger will be the same as immediately before and contract owners would not be asked to make a new investment decision since their vote or consent is not required in connection with the merger the change in depositor following the merger does not change the nature of the securities outstanding the identity of the depositor is relevant to investors primarily because the depositor makes guarantees that are in the nature of insurance obligations for example the depositor in effect guarantees to make up any shortfall in separate account assets to pay any death benefit notwithstanding that the benefit might be greater than the amount of account value supporting the contract in question and to make annuity payments for whatever period is contractually required regardless of whether the relevant contracts account value has already been depleted thereby we respectfully submit therefore that the difference in depositors is a difference that relates almost exclusively to the insurance guarantees under the northbrook contracts rather than to those aspects of the contracts that constitute or cause the contracts to be securities this argues strongly against the conclusion that the existence of a different depositor necessarily gives rise to a different security moreover even if the separate account mergers were deemed to involve the issuance of new or different securities such issuance would not be registrable under the terms of section  or rule  because contract owners do not have any discretion about whether or not to participate in the separate account mergers accordingly the contract owners will not be called upon to make the kind of investment decision that historically has been deemed necessary for an offer or sale to occur that would bring section  into play nor in this case will there be the kind of security holder action that under the terms of the rule is required to bring rule  into play  fixed account transfer in our view the fixed account transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act no change will be made to the northbrook mva contracts by virtue of the fixed account transfer except that allstate will succeed northbrook as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the northbrook mva contracts these rights and benefits ie surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc will remain the same northbrook will transfer its nonunitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the northbrook mva contracts intact to allstate consequently when the fixed account transfer becomes effective allstate will hold these assets in the same nonunitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer as discussed above owners of northbrook mva contracts will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the fixed account transfer and will not by virtue of the fixed account transfer have available any new or different investment options consequently owners of northbrook mva contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the fixed account transfer b section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer in our view the succession of allstate to the position of depositor for the northbrook life separate account as a result of the merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to section  of the  act the merger will cause a change in the depositor of the northbrook life separate account which will involve a change in the coissuer of the units of interest under variable life insurance contracts funded through that separate account however the change in depositor will not change the structure or operation of the northbrook life separate account or its relationship to the insurance company issuing the northbrook vli contracts or to the contract owners the northbrook life separate account would continue to be treated as a separate entity for all relevant purposes including financial reporting the commissions ectoplasmic theory in our view supports the position that northbrook life separate account as such will have a continuing uninterrupted existence notwithstanding the change of the insurance company serving as its depositor and having legal ownership of its assets although the assets of northbrook life separate account will become assets of allstate such assets will remain intact in a legally separate account and for financial reporting purposes the separate account will be treated as a continuing separate entity accordingly to reflect the change in legal ownership of the assets of the northbrook life separate account from northbrook to allstate following the consummation of the merger allstate and the separate account will file a new registration statement on form n that will constitute an amendment to the separate accounts existing registration under the  act the form n registration statement also will register under the  act any securities transactions effected under the northbrook vli contracts after the merger allstate will file the form n registration statement to ensure that it will become effective on or about the effective date of the merger c section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer and the separate account mergers based on the foregoing analysis we also believe that the separate account transfer does not involve an exchange of securities the separate account interests in the northbrook vli contracts issued by an investment company the northbrook vli separate account for securities of any other investment company for purposes of section  of the  act in addition for the reasons discussed above we believe that the separate account mergers do not involve an offer of exchange within the meaning of section  however should the separate account transfer or the separate account mergers be viewed as including an offer of exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of section  we believe that such transactions would comply with the requirements of section a and rule ab thereunder because any such exchange would be effected at relative net asset values thus commission approval of such transactions should not be required under section  of the  act d continued reliance on prior exemptive relief is appropriate we believe the exemptions under the  act that northbrook the northbrook separate accounts and the other parties named therein have received from the commission or its staff should continue to apply after the merger to allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and other parties named therein to the extent they continue to be relied upon without the filing with the commission of amended or duplicative applications for the same relief their continued applicability is appropriate because the merger will not change the operations of allstate separate account i nor its relationship to its depositor any other separate account or contract owners the only changes resulting from the merger are i the substitution of allstate for northbrook as depositor for the northbrook separate accounts and as coissuer and insurer of the northbrook contracts ii the transfer of the subaccounts of the northbrook separate accounts to allstate separate account i iii the transfer of northbrook life separate account to allstate and iv the consolidation of the transferred subaccounts that invest in the same underlying funds it is our view that such changes have no impact upon and are not relevant to the exemptions that were previously granted or the justifications for those exemptions in support of our view we note that the commission staff has taken a favorable position on similar requests in several noaction letters iv noaction request based upon the above facts and circumstances we respectfully request that the commission staff issue a letter stating that it will not recommend that the commission take any enforcement action under section  of the  act and rule  thereunder in connection with the merger including the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer or under section  of the  act in connection with the separate account transfer and section  of the  act in connection with the separate account transfer and the separate account mergers in addition we request that the staff advise us that the exemptive orders cited herein to the extent they continue to be relied upon will continue to be applicable after the effective date in the manner described above to allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and to the parties named therein without the filing of amended or duplicative applications for the same exemptions for the same assurance if you have any questions or require further information with respect to this matter please call me chip lunde  or charles smith of allstate  very truly yours s

according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week magazine according to that article allstate responded to berardinellis allegations by claiming that berardinellis allegations were unfounded and unproven rather than trying to cheat customers the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying exaggerated and fraudulent claims and that its processes are absolutely sound    to investigate evaluate and promptly resolve each claim fairly based on the merits court decisions on the issues debated by berardinelli and allstate have gone both ways according to the business week article as of  courts and regulators
