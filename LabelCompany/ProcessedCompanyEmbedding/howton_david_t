us contact us product description purchase check out some of the testimonials from our satisfied customers hi there moved to tn from oldsmar fl…  years ago can’t find your sauce or rubs anywhere very sad as you have the best bbq sauce in the world sure would like to order some of the rub and hot bbq as soon as possible…smokin’ ribs this sunday i prefer the barns a burnin but the kids can’t handle it…how can i go about stockin up david b   hi steve i made chicken for my youngest son and myself for lunch  i used the rub and the mild sauce wow  it was freakin awesome i will be talking about this product with very positive points thanks again god bless teddy   hi steve as for the samples you sent over everyone loved them  i divided them up selfishly keeping a couple for myself and the response was great all the way around  for the two i took home the one i used for my bbq ended up going home with my wife’s cousin that night because he loved it so much  great sauces kieth f   by the way i got the sauces from jay a while ago and man are they the bomb… mouth watering awesome phenomenal really great  i mean that  i usually go for an au poivre with my filet but all that is changed now later bro julian   steve i apologize for not getting back with you…first i appreciate you sending the sauces second i had to fight off half the newsroom when i opened the box…i spread them around for everyone to try and i would say you have a good thing going i tend to like the sauces that have a zing without destroying your taste buds…you have a couple like that… they are outstanding thanks again robert   hi steve i put some rice buds in with the rub and it doesn’t stick anymore wonderful products you have a big winner on your hands god bless teddy   mr howton i just wanted to say that the shipment of sauces that i received from you was terrific  i have had the time to test each sauce as well as the dry rub  all i can say is wow  the southern belle sweet is still my favorite but the the southern belle sweet heat is quickly closing ini used your dry rub on an  pound pork butt that i smoked for a party and had people begging me for the recipe  i have passed your name along to several friends here in arizona and i’m sure that they will be ordering a combination of your sauces and rubs thank you for everything brian w trombly quote   home • about us • contact us • product
