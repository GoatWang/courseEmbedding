close top stories the latest daily floss sections getty images  actors you might not realize do commercial voiceovers by kate erbland november   getty images nowadays it’s easier than ever to skip over all those pesky and loud television commercials during your favorite programs but that hasn’t stopped some of the country’s biggest corporations and organizations from pulling out the big guns when it comes to voiceover talent consider it a nifty little trick to capture your interest and attention—after all what better way to keep your finger off the remote than the nagging sense that you’ll be able to figure out who is squawking at you to buy a truck or a hamburger or some investment product if only you could listen just a bit longer  so which famous actors and actresses have stepped up to the mic to record words on fancy cars cozy restaurants and even toilet paper you might be surprised  john cusack – chevrolet cusack came on board as the car company’s main voice man back in february when he replaced another actor tim allen as the voice o’ chevy the say anything actor might not be the obvious choice to pontificate on “a man and his truck and also a little calf and rain and the outdoors and a broken fence” but goshdangit cusack lends some serious gravitas to a strangely emotional second spot will that little lost calf be okay if cusack is narrating it it looks like we’re in the clear  jon hamm – mercedes benz the only surprising thing about actor jon hamm giving voice to the luxury lifestyle of mercedes benz is that more high profile brands haven’t begged him to do the same thing sure he’s got the smooth and sexy tones of the finest voiceover talents but he also comes with the added weight of his mad men tenure if a guy who makes his carpurchasing dollars by starring on a show about the finest advertising that money can buy is willing to stump for your product that’s one heck of an endorsement the best or nothing indeed    jason sudeikis – applebee’s applebee’s may style itself as your friendly neighborhood restaurant so friendly and neighborhoody that you can find the exact same joint in other towns around the country but that doesn’t mean they skimp on voiceover talent used to tout their affordable fare former snl funnyman jason sudeikis may be the current voice of applebee’s and his sardonic attitude really works for sandwichselling strange as that may seem but the restaurant chain has used plenty of other high profile talent in the past including both john corbett and wanda sykes  morgan freeman – visa oscarwinning actor morgan freeman may be best known for his “voice of god” roles on the big screen but he’s also used his voice talents for a handful of ads for visa and the nfl the velvetvoiced thespian might sound like an odd choice for the spunky commercials but he still manages to add sophistication and pep to otherwise raucous and relatively straightforward ads  matt damon – td ameritrade online broker td ameritrade has been going for whimsy in their latest set of ads and an upbeat matt damon is on hand on voice to add a warm familiarity to the commercials he might not be instantly recognizable but once you know it’s the good will hunting star it’s impossible not to hear his slight boston lilt in every commercial why no one has thought to dispatch damon for a series of apple commercials we’ll never know  john corbett – walgreens while he may be best remembered to a certain subset of sex and the city fans as the dude carrie bradshaw should have ended up with john corbett has spent his postsatc years carving out a hearty voiceover career the former voice of applebee’s is now the voice of another major chain walgreens similar to his work for applebee’s everyman corbett is tasked with making walgreens seem neighborhoody and friendly—in his world it’s located at “the corner of happy and healthy”  lisa kudrow – yoplait jamie lee curtis may be the face of dannon’s activia yogurt but former friend lisa kudrow gives her a real run for her probiotics as the voice of yoplait kudrow’s yogurt ads are zippy fun and fresh—not something people usually associate with boring old yogurt the familiarity of kudrow’s upbeat voice keeps things moving along and oops now you’ve bought just like a lot of yogurt  antonio banderas – nasonex it’s one of the weirdest continuing commercials on the tube today—a crudely animated series of ads that feature antonio banderas and his sexy accent as the voice of a bee who is shilling for allergy medicine nasonex’s ads are almost too weird to work and yet they appear to simply thanks to the unshakeable recognizability of their beevoice banderas more like beederas  zach braff – cottonelle actorwriterdirectorgrammy winner true fact zach braff has frequently thrown his talents into the commercial ring giving voice to such products as pur water filters and wendy’s fast food along with his continuing gig as the voice of a puppy in cottonelle’s toilet paper ads like banderas braff’s commercial voiceover isn’t confined to simple narration he’s also tasked with embodying a strange seemingly unrelated animal mascot at least the puppy is cute  allison janney – kaiser permanente we would happily listen to actress allison janney’s voice all day and if that means tuning in for kaiser permanente commercials we’ll do it who else could possibly sound so soothing so knowledgeable and so appropriately chipper while chattering about something as confusing and upsetting as health care coverage  john krasinksi – esurance another shockingly perfect pairing hollywood’s most adorable doofball and car insurance figuring out how to insure your vehicle can be a headache and a half but when john krasinski pops up on your television to tout the merits of esurance it suddenly seems entirely doable krasinski has done ads for a whole mess of products including kodak askcom puma apple tv and carnival cruises if krasinski is selling it were buying  states

point one of the nation’s biggest oil producers was settled by french trappers in the early th century the name smackover may have come from the french name for the local creek chemin couvert which

origin of the name wasn’t quite so festive as the story goes the town was first named santa fe in  when the town wanted to secure a post office postal officials told it to pick another name since

legends surrounding the town’s name tend to trace it to a postmaster who was upset with a cheapskate watermelon farmer who sold a promised melon out from under him for an extra cent profit but these

is a scenic spot that rests in the middle of mount hood national forest the community itself is named after the zigzag river which drains from the zigzag glacier though the history of the name is unknown it might be traced back to joel palmer a pioneer of the oregon territory who described the erratic movements needed to descend through a ravine near mount hood “the manner of descending is to turn directly to the right go zigzag for about one hundred yards then turn short round and go zigzag until you come under the place where you started from then to the right and so on until you reach the bottom” though it was used to describe one particular ravine the name stuck and it eventually morphed into becoming a local community in addition to a town river and glacier zigzag also lends its

giggle” the village’s website says “we’re happy with our name it’s the perfect conversation starter” just how did the town come by its unusual moniker which it adopted in  there are several possibilities according to one theory the name came from the fact that the town—which was originally called cross keys after a local tavern when it was founded in —was at the intersection of two major roads another theory posits that the name is an evolution from “entercourse” because at the time the town was located next to the entrance of a racetrack the final theory revolves around the original meaning of the word intercourse “connection or dealings between persons or groups exchange especially of thoughts or feelings” the sexual meaning of the word intercourse didn’t come into popular use

son to lead the hunting party in his place according to chugwater’s website the son determined that the easiest way to kill the buffalo was to drive them off the local chalk cliffs “the word ‘chug’” the town’s website notes “is said to describe the noise that the buffalo or the falling chalk made when it hit the ground or fell into the water under the bluff depending on which version of the legend you wish to believe indians began to call the area ‘water at the place where the buffalo chug’” when white settlers came to the area they used the native american terminology for the land
