international inc three companies merged to create one powerhouse industry leader written by gch international inc produced by gch international inc in 4 three companies combined to create gch international inc gch bringing together over three centuries worth of experience the louisville kybased company is comprised of griffin  co with tobacco processing bulk and material handling equipment cardwell machine co with tobacco processing equipment and harpring inc an industrial sheet metal and hvac manufacturer   “when the three companies merged changes were made in collaboration cooperation systems and procedures” says curt richards president and ceo of gch “we have created a new culture which took best practices from each of the companies”   today gch provides highquality manufacturing industrial and commercial solutions backed with unsurpassed expertise and service the experience of the three companies has earned gch a reputation for quality innovation integrity and customer satisfaction that is unmatched   “our product and service offerings when combined provided gch with a wider range of offerings for each customer base and industry served” says richards “our experience has led gch to become a premier supplier of custom sheet metal products for the following industries tobacco food pharmaceutical appliance automotive architectural and a host of other smaller industries   “we are a turnkey provider of unique and customized solutions” he adds   richards who joined the company in  attributes gch’s success to its committed employees the staff has helped gch develop the new culture on which it operates the cooperation of its employees has allowed gch to excel and become a leader in the industry   “the progress and success we have experienced in the past two plus years would not have been possible without our employees” he says   business with no boundaries   gch is open to working within its expertise to create just about anything the company has a number of standard services and products but is also willing to customize work   richards remarks a recent foray into metal artworks in which the company works with artists to create metal artwork from models gch recently worked with a hospital to bring to fruition a steel chandelier and created a steel and glass dividing wall for a major hotel   gch also offers standard services such as architecture and cnc fabrication the company combines aesthetics and functionality with beauty and durability gch staff uses every latest technology to provide customers with exactly the final outcome desired   gch brings innovation and creativity to even the basic services while cnc fabrication can be seen as something standard across the board gch takes pride in using the latest cnc technology to provide the ultimate contract manufacturing services the company’s cnc turret punch presses combined with cnc press breaks and other stateoftheart machining equipment offers a complete range of cutting punching forming and painting services   in addition to excellent services gch offers the company has a list of products available for customers one major section of production is the company’s tobacco processing equipment companies like troyer brothers tobacco harvesters use gch’s equipment in the process of harvesting storing and distributing and gch consults with these clients   “we strive to partner with our customers so that together we can design build and install a solution that is uniquely perfect for their situation” says richards   gch has supplied more than  silos across the globe to be used with all types of tobacco production the equipment gch offers is manufactured for efficiency and dependability staff in gch’s engineering department has even used technology and innovation to develop a clean design the company continues to work with the university of kentucky’s agricultural department to continue developing cutting edge technology   rising above   while  and  were tough years for gch the company has rebounded well and is looking toward the future richards foresees expanding geographically and reaching new industries the company is also looking for ways to improve services and products currently offered through working with customers in order to rise above competition   “we spend a fair amount of our research and development money collaborating with other ‘expert’ companies in the industry we serve rather than reinventing the wheel” says richards   in addition to expanding geographically and reaching to new market segments gch is always on the look out for new products services or internal initiatives for example the company is currently collaborating with oxylow on a “smartliner” system to preserve tobacco while it is being shipped and stored which would help eliminate normal degradation and infestation   gch has also collaborated with best a tomra sorting company to use sensorbased technologies to create a “stratus” system for early detection of nontobaccorelated materials   with work primarily focused on the eastern and midwest united states gch is looking to focus more on the entire country and reach across the pond to the united kingdom regardless of whether it is based on geography or client base the company is looking to expand and gch international inc will continue in ranks as an industry leader   for more information on gch international inc please visit wwwgchintlcom   « previous next » published on september  3 showcase your feature on your website with a custom “as featured in us
