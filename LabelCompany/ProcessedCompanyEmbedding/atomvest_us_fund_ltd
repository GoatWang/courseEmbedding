may result in added expenses a lower return and increased tax liability debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event deferred tax risk the fund is classified for federal tax purposes as a taxable regular corporation or socalled subchapter c corporation as a c corporation the fund is subject to us federal income tax on its taxable income at the graduated rates applicable to corporations currently at a maximum rate of  as well as state and local income taxes the fund will not benefit from the current favorable federal income tax rates on longterm capital gains and fund income losses and expenses will not be passed through to the funds shareholders an investment strategy whereby a fund is taxed as a regular corporation or c corporation rather than as a regulated investment company for us federal income tax purposes is a relatively recent strategy for openend registered investment companies such as the fund this strategy involves complicated accounting tax net asset value nav and share valuation aspects that would cause the fund to differ significantly from most other openend registered investment companies energy infrastructure mlp risk the fund will concentrate its investments in the energy sector energy infrastructure mlps are subject to a variety of industry specific risk factors including reduced volumes of energy commodities available for transporting processing storing or distributing changes in energy commodity prices a sustained reduced demand for crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products depletion of the natural gas reserves or other commodities if not replaced natural disasters extreme weather and environmental hazards rising interest rates which could drive investors into other investment opportunities environmental damage claims and threats of attack by terrorists on energy assets in addition taxes government regulation international politics price and supply fluctuations volatile interest rates and energy conservation may cause difficulties for energy infrastructure mlps high yield debt securities junk bond risk investments in high yield debt securities junk bonds and other lowerrated securities will subject the fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuers ability to pay interest and principal when due are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value mlp risk the fund invests principally in securities of mlps which are subject to the following risks limited partner risk an mlp is a public limited partnership or limited liability company taxed as a partnership under the code although the characteristics of mlps closely resemble a traditional limited partnership a major difference is that mlps may trade on a public exchange or in the overthecounter market the risks of investing in an mlp are similar to those of investing in a partnership including more flexible governance structures which could result in less protection for investors than investments in a corporation investors in an mlp normally would not be liable for the debts of the mlp beyond the amount that the investor has contributed but investors may not be shielded to the same extent that a shareholder of a corporation would be in certain circumstances creditors of an mlp would have the right to seek return of capital distributed to a limited partner which right would continue after an investor sold its investment in the mlp liquidity risk the ability to trade on a public exchange or in the overthecounter market provides a certain amount of liquidity not found in many limited partnership investments however mlp interests may be less liquid than conventional publicly traded securities and therefore more difficult to trade at desirable times andor prices interest rate risk in addition mlp distributions may be reduced by fees and other expenses incurred by the mlp mlps generally are considered interestrate sensitive investments during periods of interest rate volatility these investments may not provide attractive returns general partner risk the holder of the general partner or managing member interest can be liable in certain circumstances for amounts greater than the amount of the holders investment in the general partner or managing member mlp tax risk mlps taxed as partnerships do not pay us federal income tax at the partnership level a change in current tax law or a change in the underlying business mix of a given mlp however could result in an mlp being classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes which would have the effect of reducing the amount of cash available for distribution by the mlp and as a result could cause a reduction of the value of the funds investment and consequently your investment in the fund and lower income each year the fund will send you an annual tax statement form  to assist you in completing your federal state and local tax returns if an mlp in which the fund invests amends its partnership tax return the fund will when necessary send you a corrected form  which could in turn require you to amend your federal state or local tax returns nondiversification risk the fund is nondiversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in the obligations or securities of a small number of issuers or any single issuer than a diversified fund can a change in the value of one or a few issuers securities will therefore affect the value of the fund more than if it was a diversified fund small and midcapitalization companies risks small and midcapitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions may have little or no operating history or track record of success and may have more limited product lines and markets less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies these companies securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies and their returns may vary sometimes significantly from the overall securities market as of  ilpax nav change    nas may appear until data is available
