permits you to make guaranteed withdrawals during the accumulation phase see section� �what is the prudential incomeflexsm benefit� for further details these withdrawals are different than annuity payments annuity contracts generally benefit from tax deferral when sold outside a taxfavored plan generally called a nonqualified annuity tax deferral means that you are not taxed on earnings or

the total amount in the investment option from which the transfer is to be made currently we waive this minimum transfer amount we have the right to begin imposing this minimum transfer amount for any future transfers in general your transfer request may be made by telephone electronically or otherwise in paper form to the prudential retirement service center we have procedures in place to confirm

you can make up to  transfers each contract year among the investment options without charge if you make more than  transfers in one contract year you may be charged up to  for each additional transfer for purposes of the  free transfers per year that we allow we will treat multiple transfers that are submitted on the same business day as a single transfer currently we waive this transfer charge we have the right to begin imposing this charge for any future transfers � redemption fees and abusive trading practices the practice of making frequent transfers among variable investment options in response to shortterm fluctuations in markets sometimes called �market timing� or �excessive trading� can make it very difficult for a portfolio manager to manage an underlying mutual fund�s investments frequent transfers may cause the fund to hold more cash than otherwise necessary disrupt management strategies increase transaction costs or affect performance for these reasons the annuity was not designed for persons who make programmed large or frequent transfers we consider �market timingexcessive trading� to be one or more trades into and out of or out of and into the same variable investment option within a rolling day period when each exceeds a certain dollar threshold automatic or systemdriven transactions such as regularly scheduled or periodic distributions do not constitute prohibited excessive trading and will not be subject to these criteria in light of the risks posed by market timingexcessive trading to contract owners and other mutual fund investors we monitor annuity transactions in an effort to identify such trading practices we reserve the right to limit the number of transfers in any year for all contract owners and to take the other actions discussed below we also reserve the right to refuse any transfer request from all or certain contract owners if a we believe that market timing as we define it has occurred or b we are informed by an underlying fund that transfers in its shares must be restricted under its policies and procedures concerning excessive trading in furtherance of our general authority to restrict transfers as described above and without limiting other actions we may take in the future we have adopted the following specific procedures � � warning upon identification of activity that meets the markettiming criteria a warning letter will be sent to the contract owner � � restriction a second incidence of activity meeting the market timing criteria within a sixmonth period will trigger a trade restriction to the extent permitted by law we will restrict a contract owner from trading through the internet phone or facsimile for all investment options available to the contract owner in such case the contract owner will be required to provide written direction via standard nonovernight us mail delivery for trades of the underlying funds the duration of a trade restriction is  months and may be extended incrementally  months if the behavior recurs during the month period immediately following the initial restriction � � action by an underlying fund the portfolios may have adopted their own policies and procedures with respect to excessive trading of their respective shares and we reserve the right to enforce these policies and procedures the prospectuses for the portfolios describe any such policies and procedures which may be more or less restrictive than the policies and procedures we have adopted under federal securities regulations we are required to  enter into a written agreement with each portfolio or its principal underwriter that obligates us to provide to the portfolio promptly upon request certain information about the trading activity of individual contract owners and  execute instructions from the portfolio to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by specific contract � part ii prudential retirement security annuity prospectus����sections �   what investment options can i choose continued � � owners who violate the excessive trading policies established by the portfolio in addition you should be aware that some portfolios may receive �omnibus� purchase and redemption orders from other insurance companies or intermediaries such as retirement plans the omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual owners of variable insurance contracts andor individual retirement plan participants the omnibus nature of these orders may limit the portfolios in their ability to apply their excessive trading policies and procedures in addition the other insurance companies andor retirement plans may have different policies and procedures or may not have any such policies and procedures because of contractual limitations for these reasons we cannot guarantee that the portfolios and thus contract owners will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to other insurance companies andor retirement plans that may invest in the portfolios a portfolio also may assess a short term trading fee in connection with a transfer out of the variable investment option investing in that portfolio that occurs within a certain number of days following the date of allocation to the variable investment option each portfolio determines the amount of the short term trading fee and when the fee is imposed the fee is retained by or paid to the portfolio and is not retained by us the fee will be deducted from your contract value although our transfer restrictions are designed to prevent excessive transfers they are not capable of preventing every potential occurrence of excessive transfer activity � scheduled transactions scheduled transactions include systematic withdrawals systematic investments required minimum distributions substantially equal periodic payments under section�t of the internal revenue code of  as amended code and annuity payments scheduled transactions are processed and valued as of the date they are scheduled unless the scheduled day is not a business day in that case the transaction will be processed and valued on the next business day unless with respect to required minimum distributions substantially equal periodic payments under section�t of the code and annuity payments only the next business day falls in the subsequent calendar year in which case the transaction will be processed and valued on the prior business day � voting rights we are the legal owner of the shares of the underlying mutual funds used by the variable investment options however we vote the shares of the mutual funds according to voting instructions we receive from contract owners when a vote is required we will mail you a proxy which is a form you need to complete and return to us to tell us how you wish us to vote when we receive those instructions we will vote all of the shares we own on your behalf in accordance with those instructions we will vote fund shares for which we do not receive instructions and any other shares that we own in our own right in the same proportion as shares for which we receive instructions from contract owners this voting procedure is sometimes referred to as �mirror voting� because as indicated in the immediately preceding sentence we mirror the votes that are actually cast rather than decide on our own how to vote in addition because all the shares of a given mutual fund held within our separate account are legally owned by us we intend to vote all of such shares when that underlying fund seeks a vote of its shareholders as such all such shares will be counted towards whether there is a quorum at the underlying fund�s shareholder meeting and towards the ultimate outcome of the vote thus under �mirror voting� it is possible that the votes of a small percentage of contract owners who actually vote will determine the ultimate outcome we may change the way your voting instructions are calculated if it is required or permitted by federal or state regulation � substitution we may substitute one or more of the underlying mutual funds used by the variable investment options we may also cease to allow investments in existing funds we would not do this without the approval of the securities and exchange commission sec and any necessary state insurance departments you will be given specific notice in advance of any substitution we intend to make � part ii prudential retirement security annuity prospectus����sections �   what kind of payments will i receive during the annuity phase annuitization � � payment provisions you can begin taking annuity payments any time after the first contract anniversary we make the income plans described below available at any time before the annuity date these plans are called �annuity options� or �settlement options� during the annuity phase all of the annuity options under this contract are fixed annuity options this means that your participation in the variable investment options ends on the annuity date generally once the annuity payments begin the annuity option cannot be changed and you cannot make withdrawals or surrender the contract in

not describe prudential incomeflex please see section� of this prospectus for additional information about the prudential incomeflex benefit � option  annuity payments for a fixed period under this option we will make equal payments for the period chosen up to  years but not to exceed life expectancy the annuity payments may be made monthly quarterly semiannually or annually as you choose for the fixed period if the annuitant dies during the annuity phase payments will continue to the beneficiary for the remainder of the fixed period or if the beneficiary so chooses we will make a single lump sum payment the amount of the lump sum payment is determined by calculating the present value of the unpaid future payments this is done by using the interest rate used to compute the actual payments � option  life income annuity option under this option we will make annuity payments monthly quarterly semiannually or annually as long as the annuitant is alive if the annuitant dies before we have made  years worth of payments we will pay the beneficiary in one lump sum the present value of the annuity payments scheduled to have been made over the remaining portion of that  year period unless we were specifically instructed that such remaining annuity payments continue to be paid to the beneficiary the present value of the remaining annuity payments is calculated by using the interest rate used to compute the amount of the original  payments � other annuity options we currently offer a variety of other annuity options not described above at the time annuity payments are chosen we may make available to you any of the fixed annuity options that are offered at your annuity date � tax considerations your contract will be held in a custodial account established as an individual retirement account ira therefore you should consider the required minimum distribution provisions of the code requirements of the ira when selecting your annuity option � how we determine annuity payments generally speaking the annuity phase of the contract involves our distributing to you in increments the value that you have accumulated we make these incremental payments either over a specified time period eg  years fixed period annuities or for the duration of the life of the annuitant and possibly coannuitant life annuities there are certain assumptions that are common to both fixed period annuities and life annuities in each type of annuity we assume that the value you apply at the outset toward your annuity payments earns interest throughout the payout period if our current annuity purchase rates on the annuity date are more favorable to you than the guaranteed rates stated below we will make payments based on those more favorable rates assumptions that we use for life annuities and fixed period annuities differ as detailed in the following overview � fixed period annuities generally speaking in determining the amount of each annuity payment under a fixed period annuity we start part ii prudential retirement security annuity prospectus����sections � �   what kind of payments will i receive during the annuity phase annuitization continued � with the adjusted contract value and add interest assumed to be earned over the fixed period using the interest in effect we determine the benefit that can be supported during the guaranteed period such that the present value of the benefit payments equals the accumulated account balance the life expectancy of the annuitant and coannuitant are relevant to this calculation only in that we will not allow you to select a fixed period that exceeds life expectancy � life annuities there are more variables that affect our calculation of life annuity payments most importantly we make several assumptions about the annuitant�s or coannuitant�s life expectancy � below are the standard assumptions that determine the guaranteed annuity benefit as stated above if current assumptions provide a more favorable benefit the more favorable benefit will be paid � �  interest � �  load � �  male group annuity valuation table with age setback of  years plus onefifth of the number of years from  to the annuitant�s year of birth in addition certain states may require the use of assumptions that produce a more favorable benefit when these requirements apply the more favorable benefit will be paid �

options you choose to determine the value of your contract we use a unit of measure called an accumulation unit an accumulation unit works like a share of a mutual fund every day we determine the value of an accumulation unit for each of the variable investment options we do this by  adding up the total amount of money allocated to a specific investment option  subtracting from that amount insurance charges and any other applicable charges such as for taxes and  dividing this amount by the number of outstanding accumulation units when you make a purchase payment to a variable investment option we credit your contract with accumulation units of the subaccount or sub accounts for the investment options you choose the number of part ii prudential retirement security annuity

the contracts if as we expect the charges that we collect from the contracts exceed our total costs in connection with the contracts we will earn a profit otherwise we will incur a loss the rates of certain of our charges have been set with reference to estimates of the amount of specific types of expenses or risks that we will incur in most cases this prospectus identifies such expenses or risks in the name of the charge however the fact that any charge bears the name of or is designed primarily to defray a particular expense or risk does not mean that the amount we collect from that charge will never be more than the amount of such expense or risk nor does it mean that we may not also be compensated for such expense or risk out of any other charges we are permitted to deduct by the terms of the contract � insurance and administrative charges each day we make a deduction for the insurance and administrative charges these charges cover our expenses for mortality and expense risk administration marketing and distribution the mortality risk portion of the charge is for assuming the risk that the annuitants will live longer than expected based on our life expectancy tables when this happens we pay a greater number of annuity payments the expense risk portion of the charge is for assuming the risk that the current charges will be insufficient in the future to cover the cost of administering the contract the administrative expense portion of the charge compensates us for the expenses associated with the administration of the contract this includes preparing and issuing

must be issued to a custodial account established as an ira this description assumes that you have satisfied the requirements for eligibility for these accounts you should be aware that tax favored plans such as iras generally provide tax deferral regardless whether they invest in annuity contracts this means that when a tax favored plan invests in an annuity contract it generally does not

distributions from tax favored retirement plans either directly or within  days from the date of these distributions if he or she meets the requirements for distribution once you buy the contract you can make regular ira contributions under the contract to the extent permitted by law and the contract however if you make such regular ira contributions you should note that you will not be able to

timely distribution is made please note that there is a  tax penalty on the amount of any minimum distribution not made in a timely manner to determine the amount of any required minimum distributions the value of the contract will be calculated based on the sum of the contract value and the actuarial value of any additional death benefits and benefits under the contract as a result if amounts are distributed from the contract to satisfy the required minimum distributions rules the amount distributed may be larger than if the calculation were based on the contract value only which may in turn result in an earlier but not before the required beginning date distribution of amounts under the contract and an increased amount of taxable income distributed to the contract owner and a reduction of death benefits and the benefits of any optional riders you can use the minimum distribution option to satisfy the irs required minimum distribution rules for this contract without either beginning annuity payments or surrendering the contract we will distribute to you this required minimum distribution amount less any other partial withdrawals that you made during the year although the irs rules determine the required amount to be distributed from your ira each year certain payment alternatives are still available to you if you own more than one ira you can choose to satisfy your minimum distribution requirement for each of your iras by withdrawing that amount from any of your iras similarly if the ira that includes the contract has other investments you can choose to satisfy

ira program subject to a minimum annual fee of  and a maximum annual fee of  the contract does not impose any sales charges on investments in the contract or any sales charges or other withdrawal charges on withdrawals from or surrenders of the contract priac reserves the right to charge a maximum transfer fee of  per transfer after the twelfth transfer among investment options in the contract

additional prudential mutual funds in the future any class of shares of a prudential mutual fund made available in the retirement plan program are not subject to any sales charges on purchases or any sales charges or other withdrawal charges on redemption no fee or charge applies to any exchange from one prudential mutual fund to another prudential mutual fund investments in the prudential mutual funds are subject to ongoing fees and expenses  unlike the ira program there is no set account fee under the retirement plan program instead each plan sponsor negotiates an administrative services agreement with priac or an affiliate under which priac or the affiliate provides recordkeeping and other services to the plan although the terms of these administrative services agreements vary from plan to plan in all cases no transaction fees are charged for exchanges from one investment option to another investment option under the program  the programs are designed to provide flexibility to transfer value among the investment options available under the program applicants state that under existing procedures and rules a and a under the  act exchanges may be made among the variable annuity subaccounts and exchanges may be made among the prudential mutual funds  applicants propose to add an additional exchange feature under the programs in particular applicants propose that participants be permitted to transfer value  from a separate account to a prudential mutual fund and  from a prudential mutual fund to a separate account applicants seek a commission order under section  of the  act to permit this additional exchange feature  applicants represent that the exchange feature under any program will meet the following conditions a no sales charge or other charge will be assessed in connection with a withdrawal from a separate account to be transferred to a prudential mutual fund b no sales charge or other charge will be assessed in connection with an allocation to a separate account from a transfer from a prudential mutual fund c the distributor will offer in the program only classes of prudential mutual funds that do not charge any sales or other charges on purchases or redemption d the exchange will not be a taxable event or have adverse tax consequences for the participant and e the separate account prospectus will disclose the terms of the exchange feature including i the fact that applicants reserve the right to terminate or modify the program upon notice ii any limitations on exchanges and iii the effect of an exchange on any contract benefits including the guaranteed withdrawal benefit  applicants state that exchanges will be subject to any rules or procedures established under the contract or established by the prudential mutual funds with respect to transfers and redemptions generally including minimum transfer amounts and policies and procedures relating to frequent transfers and abusive trading practices applicants also reserve the right to implement exchange limitations for the programs generally no fees or charges will be assessed in connection with any exchange from a separate account to a prudential mutual fund or from a prudential mutual fund to a separate account  applicants intend to make this exchange feature available on an ongoing basis to all participants but reserve the right to terminate the offer with respect to all or any of the investment options with advance notice to affected participants applicants legal analysis  section a of the  act provides in pertinent part that “it shall be unlawful for any registered openend company or any principal underwriter for such a company to make or cause to be made an offer to the holder of a security of such company or of any other openend investment company to exchange his security for a security in the same or another such company on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the respective securities to be exchanged unless the terms of the offer have first start printed page been submitted to and approved by the commission or are in accordance with such rules and regulations as the commission may have prescribed in respect of such offers which are in effect at the time such offer is made” section c provides that irrespective of the basis of exchange subsection a shall be applicable to any offer of exchange of any security of a registered openend company for a security of a registered unit investment trust or to any offer of exchange of any security of a registered unit investment trust for the securities of any other investment company although all the proposed exchanges would be at net asset value the involvement of any registered unit investment trust such as a separate account requires a prior order of approval of the commission  the legislative history of section  indicates that the purpose of the provision is to provide the commission with an opportunity to review the terms of certain offers of exchange to ensure that a proposed offer is not being made “solely for the purpose of exacting additional selling charges” h rep no  th cong d sess   one of the practices congress sought to prevent through section  was the practice of inducing investors to switch securities so that the promoter could charge investors another sales load applicants assert that the proposed offers of exchange involve no possibility of such abuse  applicants assert that because the proposed exchange offers for which approval is sought will be based on the relative net asset values or unit values of the interests being exchanged there is no possibility of the abuse to which section  was directed nevertheless because each of the proposed exchange offers involves a unit investment trust section c makes section a inapplicable irrespective of the basis of the exchange applicants state that exemptive relief is necessary for applicants to offer the proposed exchange feature  applicants note that previous applications under section a and orders granting those applications appropriately have focused on sales loads or sales load differentials and administrative fees to be imposed for effecting a proposed exchange rule a adopted under section  of the  act provides blanket commission approval of certain types of offers of exchange of one variable annuity contract for another or of one variable life insurance contract for another applicants state that adoption of rule a represents the most recent commission action under section  of the  act as with rule a the focus of the rule is primarily on sales and administrative charges that would be incurred by investors for effecting exchanges applicants submit that the terms of the proposed offer are consistent with rule a because no sales or administrative charge will be incurred as a result of the exchange because one investment company involved in the proposed exchange offer is organized as a unit investment trust rather than as a management investment company applicants believe that they may not rely upon rule a class relief  applicants request that the order extend to all similarly situated current and affiliated entities defined previously as insurance companies separate accounts and distributors applicants also request that the order extend to all variable annuity contracts issued by an insurance company that are substantially similar to the contracts and to any share class of any prudential mutual fund for which there are no frontend sales charges or deferred sales charges  applicants submit that providing class relief is appropriate applicants assert that because no frontend or deferred sales charges are applicable and all exchanges will be at relative net asset value there will be no possibility of the abuses congress sought to prevent through section  furthermore without such exemptive relief before participants could be given any additional exchange options applicants would have to apply for and obtain additional approval orders applicants believe that such additional applications would present no new issues under the  act not already addressed in the application conclusion for the reasons and upon the facts summarized above applicants submit that the proposed exchange offers at net asset value do not involve any of the abuses that section  is designed to prevent and provide a benefit to participants by expanding exchange privileges under programs designed to provide a mix of investment options and annuity benefits for retirement savings start signature for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority florence e harmon deputy secretary end signature end supplemental information footnotes   participants may also direct investments under the ira program to an annuity contract offering a fixed rate investment option the “fixed rate annuity contract” interests under the fixed rate annuity contract are exempt from registration under the  act under section a of the  act because the interests under the fixed rate annuity contract are not securities issued by a registered investment company applicants are not seeking exemptive relief with respect to exchanges to and from the fixed rate annuity contract back to citation   participants may also direct investments to the fixed rate annuity contract participants may also direct investments to registered openend investment companies for which applicants or their affiliates do not serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter the
