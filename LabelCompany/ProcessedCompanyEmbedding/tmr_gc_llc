technology  media  request brochure request discount customize this report get report in  to  working days report digest global portable gas chromatograph market snapshot applications of gas chromatograph techniques have witnessed a tremendous rise in areas such as production monitoring research petrochemical quality check in the chemicals industry effluent management in the industrial sector and forensic science while the conventional stationary laboratory desktop process atline and online chromatographs of a variety of sizes and configurations are still ubiquitous across key application sectors the increased need for effective onfield analytical tools has led to the vast rise in adoption of portable gas chromatographs in the recent times  in areas such as homeland security environment sustenance and legal proceedings especially the demand for portable gas chromatographs for purposes such as trace analysis and analyte identifications has witnessed significant rise over the years the use of advanced portable instruments in these areas allow for quick analysis which helps in retaining the sample’s integrity and curtailing potential delay in sample analysis the rising demand for portable gas chromatographs from such and a variety of other areas where field analysis plays a big role in deciding the authenticity or effectiveness of analysis has compelled companies to develop a variety of portable instruments  most devices in the market presently can be segmented into two broad classes smallsized instruments that can be manually carried to the site or can be held in hands for the qualitative analysis of the sample and mediumsized instruments needing some form of transportation to be carried to the desired site for a much broader quantitative analysis with a vast rise in the number of environment sustenance norms being implemented across the globe the demand for advanced portable gas chromatographs of both handheld as well as transportable varieties is expected to significantly rise in the next few years portable gas chromatograph market overview a portable gas chromatograph gc is an analytical instrument used for separating the different components of a mixture and analyzing them the components that are separated can be made to vaporize without decomposing and the methods of separation mainly use various inert gases such as helium argon nitrogen and hydrogen across a solid stationary phase the instrument typically consists of a sample injector flow controller column oven gc column and a detector rise in government spending across regions along with importance of chromatography test in various enduse industries are the factors expected to boost the growth of the portable gas chromatograph market across various regions increasing number of conferences to create awareness about modern gas chromatography techniques and emerging application of portable in gas chromatograph in healthcare industries will keep the
