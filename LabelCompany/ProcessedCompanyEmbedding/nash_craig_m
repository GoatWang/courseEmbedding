for joining ilgs first quarter  earnings call we are very pleased with the results for the quarter and are well positioned to meet our goals for the year revenue and adjusted ebitda for the first quarter were  million and  million respectively as anticipated our acquisition last may of vistana starwoods vacation ownership business significantly contributed to the results we are successfully executing our vo growth strategy across our branded sales infrastructure while we have not opened any sales centers since the end of  consolidated timeshare contract sales were  million up  compared to  assuming we had owned vistana for the entire period this is in line with our expectations given the continued tough comp from the opening of  sales centers and the start of sales of the westin nanea maui in q  for perspective on a pro forma basis q  consolidated timeshare sales were up  yearoveryear for the rest of the year we expect a strong increase in sales reflecting the opening of new sales galleries in total we will be adding  sales centers this year the most significant being the galleries at the westin nanea and the westin los cabos both which started sales in april tour flow increased  in the quarter again on a pro forma basis primarily reflecting the success of marketing initiatives focused on new buyers consequently total consolidated timeshare sales to new buyers increased  to  volume per guest was  less due to the shift in the buyer mix as well as the tough comp related to inventory mix at the start of sales at nanea as part of our overall strategy to grow vo sales we plan to gradually increase sales to new buyers in a disciplined fashion on the exchange side despite headwinds in the us market from the continued shift in our membership mix from traditional to corporate we added resorts in highly desirable international destinations further strengthening our network in the first quarter we expanded our footprint in south america and the caribbean we also entered into exclusive multiyear club affiliation agreements with subsidiaries of  chinese hospitality companies diversifying into the shared ownership space in the us we continue to expand our network acquisition channels beyond developers by working directly with hoas and independent soldout resorts by assisting them in recycling their inventory we benefit our hoa clients and strengthen another conduit for interval internationals newmember flow turning to our rental management business aquaaston posted strong top line growth driven by an  increase in revpar primarily reflecting the contribution of reflagged and renovated higherrate properties which have come online in hawaii since the second quarter of  beyond our financial results i am very pleased that  of our companies were recognized with the most prestigious awards at the recent arda conference interval international received the arda circle of excellence ace customer service excellence award for its industryleading global member services centers the award honors organizations committed to striving for and delivering the best service advanced technology attention to customer feedback exceptional training and development and creative employee incentives are just some of the factors that have been instrumental in ensuring intervals high member satisfaction and retention levels over the years the westin princeville ocean resort villas received the prestigious circle of excellence ace community service and philanthropic award for its numerous charitable efforts in support of the local community on the hawaiian island of kauai in the  years since the resort opened it has raised more than  for various charitable programs i am extremely proud of our teams for their ongoing commitment to helping others and delivering bestinclass service let me now turn to the integration of vistana we have developed a multiphase plan for successfully integrating many aspects of the hyatt vacation ownership and vistana businesses our implementation plans will drive value while continuing to showcase the power of each of our brands last month we completed the first of several organizational changes that support this process that phase includes creating a dedicated leadership team for our sales and marketing organizations that allows us to share best practices leverage recruiting training and operating processes to build an even stronger organization developing a shared services structure for the vacation ownership businesses leveraging our finance it legal and hr teams to support this new organization these departments are beginning to share programs standardize processes reduce costs increase effectiveness and become more agile as they develop expertise across our brands and growth strategies in addition we are leveraging vistanas proven development capabilities to identify the right opportunities and successfully manage the design and construction process across our platform by combining these functions under a common leadership while we expect these changes will result in cost reductions the most significant benefits of the integration will come from revenue growth speed to roll out new initiatives and operating efficiencies as we leverage vistanas scale for the benefit of the hvo business we continue to build our capabilities always focusing on providing excellence and outstanding service to our guests and our customers and bestinclass hoa management and board support while also working to identify additional synergies and revenue opportunities between these businesses we are very excited about the future of ilg as we grow the vacation ownership business these changes are early steps in evolving the organization and continuing to optimize the performance of these leading brands now ill turn the call over to bill to take us through our financials and guidance then ill return to closing comments bill bill harvey thanks craig good afternoon everyone revenue and adjusted ebitda for the quarter were  million and  million respectively our legacy business was relatively consistent with  and the inclusion of vistana drove the strong performance in the quarter in the three months ended march  consolidated revenue increased  million from the prior year period due to the acquisition net income attributable to common stockholders was  million double that of the comparable period in  primarily due to the inclusion of vistana also contributing to the result is  million of taxeffected net favorable items primarily related to fx diluted eps was  compared to  reflecting the shares issued in connection with the vistana acquisition adjusted net income which excludes the net favorable items i just mentioned as well as the impact of purchase accounting and acquisitionrelated and restructuring costs was  million compared to  million in  adjusted diluted eps was  compared to  in the prior year again reflecting the additional shifts adjusted ebitda increased by  million to  million reflecting the inclusion of vistana in terms of our segments vacation ownership revenue increased  million to  million principally resulting from the vistana acquisition excluding cost reimbursements vacation ownership segment revenue increased  million to  million this reflects an increase of  million in sales of vacation ownership products and a  million increase in resort operations revenue higher consumer financing and management fee revenue were also important contributors excluding vistana and cost reimbursements consolidated timeshare contract sales increased  the segment revenue decreased by  million driven by lower gaap reportability of hvo sales in the quarter segment adjusted ebitda increased  million to  million due to vistana exchange and rental segment revenue was  million an increase of  compared to  excluding cost reimbursements segment revenue was  million an increase of  the increase was related to the inclusion of vistana signature network or vsn the addition of this proprietary club drove the  million increase in club rental revenue and contributed to membership and transaction revenues total interval active members at quarter end were  million consistent with  excluding vsn cost reimbursements segment revenue was basically in line with the prior year while results were unfavorably impacted by the continued shift in membership mix this was offset largely by an  increase in rental management revenue due to very strong revpar performance at aquaaston adjusted ebitda for this segment was  million an increase of  from the prior year principally due to the inclusion of vsn net cash provided by operating activities in the first  months of  was  million compared to  million the  million increase was principally due to net cash receipts from our operations mainly attributable to the inclusion of vistana partly offset by inventory spend of  million in the quarter largely due to the ongoing development activities at westin nanea net cash used in investment activities was  million related to capex for sales galleries and resort operations as well as it initiatives free cash flow for the quarter was  million compared to  million in  as of march  we had  million in cash including  million which is held in foreign subsidiaries and  million of eligible unsecuritized receivables our total debt excluding securitizations was  million until the next securitization we plan to continue to drive down on our revolver to fund our investment program for the year since we initiated our dividend program in  our dividend per share has increased  over the last  months we returned approximately  million or over  of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in terms of future buybacks as you know the tax matters agreement related to the rmp transaction restricts total buyback and share issuances for a period of  years following the acquisition with the safe harbor at approximately  of outstanding shares at closing as of march  we repurchased approximately  of the outstanding shares and had  million available under our current buyback authorization with about  year remaining under the limitation we want to maintain flexibility to pursue a variety of opportunities including ma turning now to our outlook we are reaffirming our revenue adjusted ebitda and free cash flow guidance as our business is performing in line with expectations we are on track to achieve between  to  higher consolidated timeshare contract sales this on the back of a  yearoveryear pro forma increase in full year  compared to  we will review this annual guidance on a quarterly basis as we mentioned last quarter generally there is less seasonality in the earnings of our combined platform but we expect the second quarter to be lighter than the third and fourth quarters as a reminder beginning in the second quarter resort operations will begin to reflect the negative impact of the carry costs on developerowned inventory at the newly opened properties as well as a decrease in the total number of available rooms as we begin the process of converting and renovating  sheraton and westinflagged properties these conversions and renovations are key investments in strengthening our foundation for longterm growth in the vacation ownership space including related club rental management and consumer financing revenue with that ill hand the call back to craig for closing remarks craig nash thanks bill as we look to the rest of  and beyond im going to start by referencing a recent opening of the westin los cabos resort villas  spa and westin nanea ocean villas i could not be more proud of the team which successfully opened these properties within  days of each other these worldclass resorts located in  of the most soughtafter the beach destinations in the world are key additions to our portfolio the westin nanea located on north kaanapali beach in maui is designed to be a relaxing haven with culturally inspired programs and distinctive hawaiian experiences the essence of hawaii has been carefully woven into the design elements landscaping and guest activities throughout the property including an onsite cultural center its worldclass amenities include an expansive lagoonstyle swimming pool childrens beach pool and play area oceanfront cabanas and a westinworkout fitness studio expected to be completed by yearend the resort will have  units and is adjacent to our two other highly demanded westin vo properties the westin nanea becomes our sixth upperupscale branded property in the hawaiian islands in maui alone we will have over  vacation ownership units by yearend this footprint provides significant recurring fees and embedded marketing opportunities on one of the finest beach locations in the world we also manage over  condo and hotel resorts across the islands in our aquaaston rental management portfolio certain of these properties are providing additional lead generation channels for our branded vo business coming back across the pacific the westin los cabos resort villas  spa was carefully rebuilt to preserve the hotels iconic design as an architectural landmark the unit resort combines a renowned westin wellness positioning with authentic mexican setting the spa reflects the colorful artwork of the otomi people of central mexico and spans more than  square feet the offerings include a westinworkout fitness studio  treatment rooms a spa boutique and a relaxation lounge other resort amenities include several distinct dining options multiple infinity edge pools community grilling stations and tennis courts the resort introduces the westin family program designed to cater to the new way modern familys travel with a reinvented kids club reimagined family experiences and more meaningful branded amenities for young travelers clearly these emblematic new properties enhance and diversify our product offering from a financial perspective they provide a strong foundation for future voi sales and related revenue growth to ensure strong sales performance for these exclusive properties our team is leveraging our comprehensive product offering and broad distribution platform as a reminder we have a unique product portfolio which enables us to offer customers significant flexibility while optimizing our inventory pricing we currently sell singlesite and multisite points programs as well as weekly intervals at certain locations however irrespective of their home resort or points program owners can convert to points to use within their respective vistana or hvo network the hotels affiliated with their corresponding royalty program for the interval network the westin nanea resort which commenced sales in the fall of  is sold as a singlesite points program like a multisite property point system the structure also offered at the westin st john allows owners significant flexibility in terms of size of unit length of stay and prefer dates the difference is that the singlesite characteristic appeals to customers that value and desire guaranteed access to premium destinations and are willing to pay a premium price for that guarantee the multisite club offers access to an attractive array of destinations appealing to customers who value flexibility and choice while at the same time harmonizing the inventory point value for the system with respect to distribution the westin nanea is currently being marketed at  sales galleries including a newly opened squarefoot showroom located at the resort the gallery opens up the stunning views of the resort amenities and pacific ocean and features digital technology and highquality imagery of our products and programs the other centers are located at the adjacent westin kaanapali ocean resort at the nearby westin maui resort  spa hotel and our sheraton hotel and westin princeville properties on kauai as well as at the westin kierland in scottsdale for the westin los cabos we are launching a new product westin aventuras a multisite points program which builds on the appeal of mexican vacations at the westin vacation club resorts initially westin aventuras will include the westin los cabos moving forward our plan is to include available inventory from our westin properties in cancun as well as from other mexican resorts thereafter pending final approval of the product from the mexican authorities anticipated this quarter we are leveraging our newly opened sales gallery at the resort to sell our existing weeksbased cancun property the westin lagunamar ocean resort going forward we plan to sell westin aventuras at sales galleries located at the participating resorts as well as the westin kierland another very important point with respect to the westin nanea and westin los cabos properties is that their completion marks the turning point in our inventory sourcing model as we have discussed feasibility and permitting considerations associated with these projects resulted in a frontendloaded investment plan construction on both properties will be completed by yearend after  we anticipate additional vacation ownership units to be built on a capitalefficient selfsourced justintime basis accordingly we expect our return on capital to significantly increase in  and beyond in closing i would like to highlight our unique position in the shared ownership space we have a portfolio of worldclass and irreplaceable leisure assets  billion of embedded sales value of inventory supported by a solid capitalefficient development plan a diverse and complementary platform with a significant contribution of recurring and contractual revenues and global exclusive global rights and vacation ownership to  of the leading upperupscale hospitality brands we have an industryleading team with extensive experience in sales marketing management and development of worldclass resorts as well as a track record of executing on strategic opportunities and integrating companies we look forward to providing you more detail on the significant valuecreation opportunities ahead and our clear roadmap for delivering this increased value for shareholders at our upcoming investor day on may  in new york city thats the end of my prepared remarks operator please open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of pat scholes from suntrust your line is now open pat scholes bit of a laundry list of questions here first i noticed that the volume of share repurchases in the quarter was materially less than the previous several quarters was there any blackout during that quarter that prevented you from share repurchases craig nash no no blackouts what were looking at here is we continue to evaluate our uses of cash we returned approximately  million over the past  months in the form of share buybacks and obviously our dividend so we are keeping our flexibility for a variety of opportunities including ma but we look at this every quarter pat scholes okay moving on you talked in the past about  million of annual free cash flow on average for  and  is that still a usable number bill harvey we havent changed our guidance for that period pat scholes okay al right moving on what is the liability to ilg if you were to violate the rmt tax structure before the twoyear anniversary craig nash look as part of the transaction we entered into a tax matters agreement the agreement contains two year restrictions on our ability to issue and repurchase stock as well as enter into ma transactions unless certain conditions to satisfy that twoyear period in a common time frame for these restrictions so theyre designed to make sure that we dont jeopardize both the taxfree nature of the transaction to starwood as well as their shareholders so the provision cover situations that make cause the irs to challenge this taxfree status its very technical dependent on specifying facts and circumstances and we continue to comply with our obligations under this agreement pat scholes i guess following up a little more on that i guess from a high level would be the liability if you did violate that craig nash we dont have any answer for you on that pat scholes okay and then last actually a couple of more questions you have mentioned in the prepared remarks on chinese an agreement with the chinese regarding shared ownership can you talk a little bit more about that what was that what is that about craig nash yes weve been cultivating obviously the asian market through interval international for a long time china is an attractive and growing market our brands have international appeal internationally there but in terms of these affiliations theyre regional players those are the ones that have started to get into the market quite a bit these days and were trying to grow that platform charles scholes okay and then last can you just talk a little bit more you had a comment in your prepared remarks about capitallight if you can just expand on what that means what the scope of that might be timing et cetera craig nash yes its all of the properties after nanea and cabos are going to be converted or built in terms of additional units at existing properties on a velocity sales velocitybased basis so we considered that the same thing as justintime inventory its just that were able to capture all of the development profit as well as the recurring revenue streams that flow from that resort so were not building ahead in the same way that weve done nanea and cabos operator and our next question comes from the line of chris agnew with mkm partners chris agnew a followup maybe on that last question would do i guess youre bringing in inventory on an asneeded basis and as you said sales velocity but would consider partnering with under what circumstances would you consider partnering with third parties for opportunities craig nash yes we have talked about this quite a bit and we are looking for opportunities to for third parties to source us inventory that currently not in our portfolio that will be in locations that are synergistic with the rest of our portfolio places like new york boston other kinds of urban destinations so we are studying and talking to a variety of people around that kind of justintime inventory chris agnew got it and then you talked about the advantages bringing together hyatt and vistana under umbrella management have you quantified what the synergies cost  revenue synergy opportunities are there was that part of your original synergy estimate acquiring vistana william harvey yes we are on track to meet our year synergy targets the most significant benefits from that integration will be revenue growth speed to roll out new initiatives across that platform operating efficiencies its really leveraging the scale for the benefit of hvo the cost savings from the integration are not readily evident in the numbers as we execute the growth plan because were adding approximately  jobs primarily at the newly opened resorts but youre going to see the synergies kick in more in the second half of this year and over the next  to  months chris agnew got it and i have always been under the impression that if you had different licensors that kind of limited your ability to bring together  different timeshare platforms is that the case and would the synergies be much more substantial if you had the same licensor craig nash we are not sharing any customer data the salespeople and sales organization at the property level are independent were talking about senior management and were talking about the shared services structure that are being integrated chris agnew got it got it and then last question you mentioned with your balance sheet one of the options was the ma opportunities can you frame what sort of ma opportunities you would consider or you might have in mind craig nash weve been very acquisitive over the past several years since we got spun out from iac we look at every deal we understand every deal and we view all of our options and our objective is to maximize sustainable longterm value for shareholders and so we look at deals weve done in the past and well continue to look at them operator and our next question comes from ian zaffino from oppenheimer your line is now open ian zaffino i just wanted to follow up on i guess the question about the tax liability with the rmt can you square maybe your concerns about there being a tax liability with maybe that writedown that was taken by the seller of vistana do you look at that do you take any comfort in that writedown or how should we think about it craig nash we are particularly focused on the provisions cover situations that may cause the irs the challenge the transactions taxfree status both to starwood and its stockholders and while we have some information around it we dont have all of the information so we have to be careful and we have to be conservative around it we need to comply with our obligations under the tax management because we dont know what the total liability could be ian zaffino right so are you in the process of maybe evaluating what that might be or is it sort of a just closed book on your part and youre just it is what it is craig nash we always evaluate a number of things but i dont want to talk about specific items ian zaffino okay got you and then on the new inventory thats coming online cabos and nanea can you maybe help us understand what the margin structure might be or maybe how that would impact the mix as far as maybe towards the higher end and what the economics of that might be not exact numbers but at least directionally craig nash i think at least directionally the cost of sales of that product its a highercost product we do blend that with other inventory that we owned including flex and takebacks in order to trying right margin in the mids ian zaffino so basically the margin would be similar you just have a higher selling price but a higher product cost is that the way we should be thing about that bill harvey yes operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of taylor batory from janney capital markets your line is now open tyler batory could you talk a little bit more about the decision to introduce this multisite points product to los cabos and also touch on your decision not to include the rest of the westin portfolio in some sort of a pure points model craig nash so the mexican product is a multisite pointsbased product that is going to include the mexican properties only we are starting off with cabo were going to add the cancun properties next and then other mexican properties so we sell that product both in mexico on site as well as in the united states it is proven a true product in that it is mimics pretty much what weve done in other pure points club so were very excited about being able to launch that as soon as mexican authorities give us the approval what was the other question tyler batory yes your decision not to maybe you convert your entire westin portfolio obviously excluding nanea and st john to some sort of pure points model craig nash well obviously were looking at opportunities to do that at certain locations but as we have today nanea in particular that is a premiumpriced product and people are willing to pay a premium price for it it really doesnt work in a pure points kind of structure we also have in st john singlesite pure points club with again is a premium product and consumers pay a premium price for that they want to be guaranteed that they can go there and when we look at some of our other properties and some of the other plans we have justintime or otherwise were looking at an opportunity to do more with the westin brand tyler batory okay great and then total contract sales up  obviously a good number in line with your guidance just remind us and maybe rank some of the factors that give you confidence that metrics going to accelerate meaningfully in the back half just to get to that  to  growth for the full year craig nash well based on the fact we had a strong april we also have sales centers that are opening we have a lot of units that are opening in nanea over the year as well in cabo so we feel pretty good about what weve guided to so were sticking with the guidance tyler batory okay great and then maybe a last question you gave some color new and upgrade sales do you guys have a targeted mix for new versus upgrade over the next year or so here craig nash obviously wed like to get to a  mix the question is how many years will that take us so over the next few years we hope to get to a  mix and we think that our portfolio and the new destinations will help us get there operator at this time i am showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back over to craig nash for closing remarks craig nash thanks operator i want to thank everyone for participating on todays call and for your
