train in all of our lifetimes  we often hope to find that ‘thing’ that fills a human need that thing that the public can’t quite get enough of we all know that the smartphone has taken over all of our lives and is by definition ‘the greatest sells’ device ever invented if any one makes a product that can be accessed on a smartphone that solves a human need then that product becomes ‘priceless’ and

preexisting conditions the business model is net revenue positive our company spent years developing a website for video classified ads and eventually made it an app it is robust friendly and a great product to drive small business and individual advertising in the st century then one night about a year ago some friends and i were out to dinner and having margaritas and laughing about how all relationships have baggage and everyone in relationships have some level of crazy in them however no one in the group could name a single dating site or application that was built to show the baggage or deal with the upfront upfront we all agreed that people with baggage all of us need a dating app that allows you to start off honestly and continue from that level voila we decided that an app that allowed one bag or a carryon bag to enter a dating relationship needed to be invented   hence cobo  carry on baggage only dating appi was the only one who went home and started working on it immediately the idea is that a woman can sign up for free create a profile for free upload an image for free and then select ‘one bag’ that self describes her situation her crazy or her desire hopefully the one that is most honest and reflects why she is motivated to consider being on a dating app in the first place i created choices like ‘my bag wants a baby’ probably the most honest statement of all and something no dating app really has a check box for there are  other choices and more coming now the men are ‘baggage handlers’  as they search the profiles of women they see the image and touch a button to see the description of the chosen ‘carryon bag’ as an overlay if the fellow likes what he sees and is willing to carry that bag he hits a button to ‘claim’ that bag and then he sees her total profile statement where she can explain herself in even more honest detail at that point he can choose to save that profile and then choose to contact her for chat by hitting the lets chat buttonwoman may also search and find ‘baggage handlers’ and check their selfdescribed way of handling baggage and then assign them to be a carrier save his profile and initiate contact via chat one of the baggage handler overlays says ‘heavy bags don’t scarce me  i’m a big boy” that is in response to the carryon bag that says ‘my bag has kids keys credit cards candy and kaos in it it’s heavy’ we get a big laugh out of that one when they finally decide to start chatting they click an inapp purchase popup enter their apple id and click purchase once the apple id is verified the client is instantly billed by apple our purchase price of  cents for  days of unlimited universal chat that means they can talk to as many people for as long as they want for  days with

smartphone equals a billion dollar valuationthis unique way of approaching the process of finding love has tested nothing short of amazing at this point we are moving away from friends and family and

when to remove this template message the floor of the chicago board of trade a major commodities exchange in the united states main article commodity market a commodities exchange is an exchange where various commodities and derivatives products are traded most commodity markets across the world trade in agricultural products and other raw materials like wheat barley sugar maize cotton cocoa coffee milk products pork bellies oil metals etc and contracts based on them these contracts can include spot prices forwards futures and options on futures other sophisticated products may include interest rates environmental instruments swaps or ocean freight contracts commodities exchanges usually trade futures contracts on commodities such as trading contracts to receive something say corn in a certain month a farmer raising corn can sell a future contract on his corn which will not be harvested for several months and guarantee the price he will be paid when he delivers a breakfast cereal producer buys the contract now and guarantees the price will not go up when it is delivered this protects the farmer from price drops and the buyer from price rises speculators and investors also buy and sell the futures contracts in attempt to make a profit and provide liquidity to the system however due to the financial leverage provided to traders by the exchange commodity futures traders face a substantial risk contents  commodities exchanges across the world  africa  americas  asia  europe  oceania  see also  references commodities exchanges across the worldedit main commodity exchanges

from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for countries by purchasing power parity gdp see list of countries by gdp ppp largest economies by nominal gdp in  counting the economies of the european union as one according to international monetary fund estimates the united states the worlds largest economy accounts for approximately  percent of nominal world gdp and the seven largest economies amalgamating the european union economies as one account for  percent of the total gross domestic product gdp is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year countries are sorted by nominal gdp estimates from financial and statistical institutions which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates nominal gdp does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the countrys currency such fluctuations may change a countrys ranking from one year to the next even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity ppp to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries ppp largely removes the exchange rate problem but has its own drawbacks it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade and it also requires more estimation than nominal gdp on the whole ppp per capita figures are less spread than nominal gdp per capita figures the united states is the worlds largest economy with a gdp of approximately  trillion notably due to high average incomes a large population capital investment moderate unemployment high consumer spending a relatively young population and technological innovation tuvalu is the worlds smallest national economy with a gdp of about  million because of its very small population a lack of natural resources reliance on foreign aid negligible capital investment demographic problems and low average incomes although the rankings of national economies have changed considerably over time the united states has maintained its top position since the gilded age a time period in which its economy saw rapid expansion surpassing the british empire and qing dynasty in aggregate output since chinas transition to a marketbased economy through privatisation and deregulation the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in  to second to only the united states in  as economic growth accelerated and its share of global nominal gdp surged from  in  to  in  india has also experienced a similar economic boom since the implementation of neoliberal reforms in the early s when supranational entities are included the european union is the second largest economy in the world it was the largest from  when ten countries joined the union to  after which it was surpassed by the united states the first list largely includes data compiled by the international monetary funds world economic outlook for  the second list shows the world banks  estimates and the third list includes data compiled by the united nations statistics division for  several economies which are not considered to be countries the world the european union and some dependent territories
