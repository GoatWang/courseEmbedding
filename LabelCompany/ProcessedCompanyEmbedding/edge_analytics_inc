policy edge analytics has gained attention as the internet of things iot model of connected devices has become more prevalent in many organizations streaming data from manufacturing machines industrial equipment pipelines and other remote devices connected to the iot creates a massive glut of operational data which can be difficult  and expensive  to manage by running the data through an analytics algorithm as its created at the edge of a corporate network companies can set parameters on what information is worth sending to a cloud or onpremises data store for later use  and what isnt analyzing data as its generated can also decrease latency in the decisionmaking process on connected devices for example if sensor data from a manufacturing system points to the likely failure of a specific part business rules built into the analytics algorithm interpreting the data at the network edge can automatically shut down the machine and send an alert to plant managers so the part can be replaced that can save time compared with transmitting the data to a central location for processing and analysis potentially enabling organizations to reduce or avoid unplanned equipment downtime another primary benefit of edge analytics is scalability pushing analytics algorithms to sensors and network devices alleviates the processing strain on enterprise data management and analytics

comment cancel    juhanleemet   may 0  pm as i read the brief article i was reminded of early days of scada systems for control and data acquisition communicating 0s miles by slow 00 baud modems for more efficient communications only differences were sent but there was also a background sweep over all parameters to refresh them in case of some kind of error otherwise if a bit was lost but rarely changed it could remain in the wrong state forever similarly imo one must be careful not to filter too much at the edge consider all error cases comms also add my comment cancel    robjac   jun 0  am seems to me that edgeanalytics is a repeat of the 0s0s clientserver model which turned out to be rather expensive and was mostly a means to deal with inadequate bandwidth not sure that this reason

computing the early days of the iot and its conceptual precursor mm have been characterized by the critical role of cloud platforms as application enablers intelligent systems have largely relied on the cloud level for their intelligence and the actual devices of which they consist have been relatively unsophisticated this old premise is currently being shaken up as the computing capabilities on the edge level advance faster than those of the cloud level abi research refers to this trend as a paradigm shift—from the connected device paradigm to the intelligent device paradigm this is most of all making the available architecture choices more nuanced and allowing organizations deploying the iot to enhance their physical assets and processes in novel ways edge computing also known as edge intelligence is what is driving this shift  this study explores edge computing specifically as an analytic proposition as an approach to analyze data close to its source instead of sending it to a remote server for cloudlevel analysis the report builds on abi research’s earlier work on iot analytics aiming to provide further insight and conceptual clarity on the role of the network edge in the

analytics at the edge examples of opportunity in the internet of things by fiona mcneill global product marketing manager sas the data streaming in and out of organizations from electrical and mechanical sensors rfid tags smart meters scanners mobile communications live social media and more results in staggering volumes of information when all these sources are networked to communicate with each other – without human intervention – the internet of things iot is born the iot market is estimated to include nearly  billion devices with a “global economic valueadd” of  trillion by 00 and nearly  trillion in annual sales by 00 by all accounts iot is a new type of industrial revolution but to derive useful knowledge from the tide of streaming source data – and participate in this new economy – you must have analytics in traditional analysis data is stored and then analyzed but with streaming data analytics must occur in real time as the data passes through this allows you to identify and examine patterns of interest as the data is being created the result is instant insight and immediate action so before the data is stored in the cloud or in any highperformance repository the event stream is automatically processed and using analytics to decipher streaming data as close to the device as possible creates a new realm of knowledge for many industries event streams that know more than just existing conditions and which evaluate future scenarios using advanced analytics are now within the realm of possibility let’s look at a few examples the internet of things in health care in health care analyzing iot data can result in increased uptime for machines that treat cancer which means that patients are treated when they are scheduled if a treatment time is missed it can be up to 0 percent less effective so reducing service interruptions is critical by monitoring hundreds of sensors identifying issues early and proactively correcting them service personnel armed with the necessary information and parts arrive together elekta a swedish company that provides equipment and clinical management to help treat cancer and brain disorders has cited a 0 percent reduction in site visits because of such monitoring with rising global populations and corresponding increases in disease and health care costs the remote patient monitoring market doubled from 00 to 0 and is projected to double again by 0 and what if these scenarios went beyond monitoring device status or patient conditions – to predicting machine reliability in advance of parts beginning to malfunction servicing would then move from being proactive to being optimized across each supplier’s landscape of devices and foreseeing patient problems before they even experience symptoms could avert adverse events altogether  event streams that know more than just existing conditions and which evaluate future scenarios using advanced analytics are now within the realm of possibility  how do you apply predictive capabilities to iot data highperformance analytics environments are designed to examine complex questions and produce models these algorithms are then coded into the data streams along with any data normalization and business rules to detect patterns associated with the defined future scenarios so in addition to monitoring conditions and thresholds you can use the data stream to assess likely future events the internet of things in manufacturing the automobile industry is stepping up development detection systems for imminent collisions to determine when to take evasive action based on radar and other types of remote technologies driving conditions are monitored to assess – and ultimately avoid – collisions these collision avoidance systems assess the likelihood of a collision event and automatically prescribe mechanical changes to the vehicle if the driver doesn’t respond – including deceleration and external lighting changes potential accident reduction from wide deployment could surpass 0 billion annually in savings in fact the “industrial internet” – which combines physical machinery networked sensors and software – has extensive use and promise in manufacturing including production optimization product development and aftermarket servicing ge predicts  trillion in opportunity per year by improving how assets and resources are used and how operations and maintenance are performed within industrial industries the internet of things in energy a detailed view of energy consumption patterns is needed to understand energy usage daily spikes and workload dependencies and beyond just manufacturing – lighting alone takes  percent of the world’s electricity optimized alternate energy sources can have a significant impact on all sectors for example a single blade on a gas turbine can generate 00gb of data per day wind turbines constantly identify the best angles to catch the wind and turbinetoturbine communications allow turbine farms to align and operate as a single maximized unit historically the only way to know what was happening with a turbine – even if it was on and working – was to climb 0 feet and see remote monitoring provides new eyes on the status of these energy generators  what if the same data could be used to forecast efficiency in green energy means we can store more energy for use when the wind is low predicting when excess energy is available can help determine when to charge batteries for example further extending the efficiencies of alternate energy sources   of course the energy market provides one of the most wellknown examples of iot technology altering the customer landscape with dynamic smart meter billing customers have new choices which lead energy companies to adopt a more customercentric approach the utility smart grid transformation is expected to almost double the customer information system market from  billion in 0 to  billion in 00 the internet of things in retail customers are also at the center of iot analytics in retail where some companies are studying ways to gather and process data from thousands of shoppers as they journey through stores this “instore geography” informed by sensor readings and videos considers how long shoppers linger at individual displays recording what they ultimately buy with the goal of optimizing store layout these data points can also be tied to smartdevice wifi networks in addition to appropriately targeting shoppers for promotions instore retailers can ask customer opinions – using iot data to initiate an interaction customizing the shopping experience and enhancing loyalty taking action with iot data event streams monitor patterns of interest sensors and devices generate lots of data that describes existing conditions analysis of conditions informs what actions are necessary – either immediately as an alert notification or with preplanning from predictive and other advanced analysis methods of course analysis always leads to more questions – directing what additional sensors and data can be collected to measure new aspects of the conditions elements of the event or more detail in the scenario to understand different patterns iot data by itself isn’t the value just as with traditional data sources it’s the ability to take the insights and then act on them that provides value to know what to do in the moment use analytics at the edge   references  peter middleton peter kjeldsen and jim tully “forecast the internet of things worldwide 0” gartner november  0  idc “the internet
