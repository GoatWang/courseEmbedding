waiting  prices will continue to rise corelogics latest home price index reports that home prices have appreciated by  over the last  months the same report predicts that prices will continue to increase at a rate of  over the next year the bottom in home prices has come and gone home values will continue to appreciate for years waiting no longer makes sense  mortgage interest rates are projected to increase freddie macs primary mortgage market survey shows that interest rates for a year mortgage have remained around  most experts predict that they will begin to rise over the next  months the mortgage bankers association fannie mae freddie mac  the national association of realtors are in unison projecting that rates will increase by this time next year an increase in rates will impact your monthly mortgage payment a year from now your housing expense will increase if a mortgage is necessary to buy your next home  either way you are paying a mortgage there are some renters who have not yet purchased a home because they are uncomfortable taking on the obligation of a mortgage everyone should realize that unless you are living with your parents rentfree you are paying a mortgage  either yours or your landlords as an owner your mortgage payment is a form of forced savings that allows you to have equity in your home that you can tap into later in life as a renter you guarantee your landlord is the person with that equity are you ready to put your housing cost to work for you  its time to move on with your life the cost of a home is determined by two major components the price of the home and the current mortgage rate it appears that both are on the rise but what if they werent would you wait look at the actual reason you are buying and decide if it is worth waiting whether you want to have a great place for your children to grow up you want your family to be safer or you just want to have control over renovations maybe now is the time to buy if the right thing for you and your family is to purchase a home this year buying sooner rather than later could lead to substantial savings  keeping current matters less helpful helpful local insight was
