radical protection read more about the purest and freshest alkaline water the purest and freshest alkaline water imagine having the ability to take normal tap water and give it a special charge that can neutralize free radicals and give you the benefits mentioned above alkaline ionized water or tyent water™ has a negative charge called oxidation reduction potential orp the orp properties of alkaline water are known by many as simply “antioxidants” to explain further normal body functions cause high or rising oxidation in the body which is not good to fight against the oxidation alkaline water’s negative orp charge literally hinders the oxidation process by counteracting any rising oxidation effect ionized water essentially rejuvenates us a glass of alkaline water brings us as close as we can ever hope to get to a fountain of youth as incredible as that may sound is having gallons of alkaline water flowing freely just a dream not any more the purest freshest and healthiest alkaline water is also ionized and it is created by a tyent water ionizer that hooks to your tap  hide “the tyent machine performs far above anything else that is out there”  dr joe fawcett dc alkaline water vs regular water—a true story by michele steffney alkaline water expert who wants the best water on earth i do i do does it exist yes absolutely it is tyent ionized alkaline water but before you just take my word for it let’s break it down by one type of water at a time first let me just explain a bit about my experience with water when i was about  years old…  read more of my alkaline water story i used to see culligan commercials these commercials used scare tactics that showed all of the dangerous contaminants in your tap water whoa they were scary i remember going to my dad about it and he just shrugged his shoulders and pretty much ignored me i suppose it did not scare him but it definitely sparked an interest in me and a mission to find the healthiest water on earth luckily for all of us water has come a long way since those commercials today there are loads of ways to get your water and new ways popping up daily let’s take a quick trip down memory lane shall we  the obvious classics since the prehistoric days include water from natural lakes rivers or springs  well water  city water  bottled distilled water for use in chemistry and other applications not for drinking  bottled spring water  bottled purified water  flavored waters with fizz and without  gravity pitchers  basic household filters including whole house systems faucet filters and water softeners  reverse osmosis systems  nonelectric alkalizersionizers  electric water ionizer machines choices choices and more choices but don’t fret because since many of the choices listed do not meet our standards let’s not waste time since our goal is to find the healthiest water the natural choices such as rivers and streams can be eliminated right away because of pollution moving on we will eliminate nontreated well water since it needs to be further filtered and of course any basic filter just won’t meet our high expectations now that those subpar water choices are out of the way let’s concentrate on what’s left and what’s still questionably healthy alkaline water vs bottled water as funny as it may seem i still see people loading large plastic wrapped crates of bottled water into their shopping carts i feel sorry that so many people still do not know that they would probably be better off just drinking unfiltered tap water sad but true in most cases although there are a few very expensive semihealthy bottled water brands on the market most of the bottled water companies take plastic bottles and fill them with plainold filtered tap water some of it is packed in such cheap plastic containers that you can smell or even taste plastic when you drink it does this plasticsmelling water sound healthy to you i didn’t think so besides it’s not good for the environment or your pocketbook either to top it off most bottled water is surprisingly acidic and some can even be contaminated with microorganisms that grow from inventory that sits for so long in hot trucks pretty gross and very inconvenient if you ask me furthermore who has the space for all of those clunky bottles anyway score for bottled water alkaline water vs tap water to me this topic is a no brainer but who am i to judge to start tap water is mandated to have neutral ph which from a ph standpoint is okay—meaning it’s not going to harm you but it won’t help you either for me i want to drink a healthy ph of  to  to help keep my body better balanced however i want more than just a healthy ph and you should too here’s what you are missing when you drink tap water over alkaline water a healthy ph better hydration  since it does not go through an electrolysis process purity  most tap water has contaminants see what’s in your water here in tyent’s free water report antioxidants  there is nothing in tap water to help keep your body from dangerously oxidizing score for tap water alkaline water from a water ionizer vs bottled alkaline water if you are traveling or in a pinch then bottled alkaline water is just fine the ph is usually sufficient however it costs up to  a bottle or more which in my book is way too much to pay especially since it’s not as highquality as the ionized water that comes fresh from a tyent unit when bottled alkaline water is manufactured there is a packaging process that is required by law that kills the healthy antioxidant properties of the water so since the antioxidant properties are one of the top reasons to drink ionized alkaline water it fails in my book there are some regions of exception due to municipal source water score for bottled alkaline water overall analysis water from an electric water ionizer is still the best choice it has all of the healthy properties your body needs so in my book it’s really the only choice score for alkaline water from a water ionizer  hide which alkaline water system is bestwe can help you find the toprated water ionizer water ionizer buyer’s guide fill out form are there benefits of

ionized water now then check out how the benefits of owning a unit far outweigh buying bottled alkaline water here is a quick list of the key topics that will be covered here the hassle of buying bottled alkaline water the hassle of buying alkaline water is based on the lack of convenience in many regions bottled alkaline water is only sold through health food stores or can only be found online therefore you will need to take an extra trip or step to purchase it aside from making a special trip you will also need to load it into your cart lug it back to your car drag it into your home and then store it until you need it avoid the inconvenience of the load lug and store syndrome and just push a button on your ionizer when you want a fresh glass of alkaline water the cost of buying bottled alkaline water the cost of buying bottled alkaline water is about  times more than the cost of owning a water ionizer a glass of water from a tyent water ionizer costs about  cents a glass plus you will not have to pay for the gas to make that special trip to the health food store just to buy it or pay the high cost of shipping the environmental cost of buying bottled alkaline water has a high price tag as well there are a lot of hidden costs and environmental factors that you may have not considered like these the cost of fuel used to make and transport the plastic bottles the energy used for manufacturing the cost of fuel in transporting heavy liquids in bottles across the country to distributors the cost of your fuel to transport the bottles to your home the cost of recycling or the environmental cost from taking up more landfill space slash the huge price tag into bits by purchasing a tyent water ionizer that will save you a lot of money plus owning a tyent machine is very ecofriendly the shortcomings of buying bottled alkaline water the shortcomings of buying bottled alkaline water over owning a water ionizer are vast aside from the whopping costs and tremendous hassles of buying bottled alkaline water you will not get the same health benefits either sure bottled alkaline water is healthier than ordinary bottled water but it does not have as many antioxidants as alkaline water that is fresh from your water ionizer plus you are limited to the ph level that comes in the bottle whereas with a tyent unit you can choose the ph level that you want remember there are so many money saving uses for the various ph levels available in your tyent unit as a gift to you here is a free ebook on the many uses of the water available from a tyent water

hydrogen gas gives ionized alkaline water many of its benefits ionized water is produced by electrolysis enabling the ‘free’ and available hydrogen gas to dissolve into the water it is the presence of hydrogen gas which gives alkaline water many of it’s benefits research has shown that removing the hydrogen gas in ionized water diminishes the benefits and perhaps unsurprisingly adding extra hydrogen gas to the water increased the therapeutic benefits drinking hydrogenrich alkaline water is the perfect way to mount a defense against free radicals which are responsible for oxidization – or decay – within our bodies is alkaline water good or bad since alkaline water has such a high antioxidant content and because so many doctors recommend antioxidants it is very good for you when you compare alkaline water to orange juice you will find that fresh squeezed orange juice has a negative orp of  and we can only drink a few glasses of fresh orange juice per day we can drink as much

alkaline water does your body need read more alkaline water ionizer benefits ionized alkaline water will contain thousands of tiny bubbles when it pours out of a tyent water ionizer those bubbles are molecular hydrogen which is the antioxidant property of ionized alkaline water molecular hydrogen is the most fragile aspect of ionized water lasting only a maximum of  hours which is why it is

water a condition which leaves the bodys cells in a perpetual state of weakness and defense most people simply do not drink enough water at least half our weight in ounces to keep ourselves properly

your research here is a quick list of what to pay attention to when shopping for an ionizer  water ionizers use the process of electrolysis to separate normal “stable” water into “unstable” positively charged acid water and negatively charged alkaline water only use an electric water ionizer otherwise you will not get all of the benefits  while ph gets all the attention it is the oxidation reduction potential “orp” that is important to improving and maintaining your health the antioxidants orp is a measure of the electrical charge in the water and plays a key role in eliminating acid from the body which in turn helps raise the ph of the body and allows the body to heal itself your body performs the miracles not the water the water simply gives your body a chance to work properly a machine that offers the most plates with the largest surface size produces a stronger orp overall  the amount of time that the water is in contact with the ionizer plates makes a difference so look for large plates and at least  of them the brand that you choose can play a major role in determining performance by having more plates larger plates and solidmesh hybrid plates  pay attention to the amount of amps that run through the actual plates during the ionization process here’s a simple checklist for purchasing a water ionizer the amount of amps that is passed over the plates the size of the plates the number of plates should be at least  the quality of the materials of the plates platinum coated titanium is safest and most durable warranty some companies such as tyent usa offer a

extremely fatigued after only two and a half miles – which was two and a half miles from my car i walked back which was a struggle i came home and went to bed after a week of being too fatigued to go to work i went to see the local doctor i was told that there appeared to be nothing wrong – and was prescribed an asthma inhaler to help me breath i didn’t and don’t have asthma and i didn’t have a problem breathing i presume because i told the doctor that i was running at the onset of my fatigue he assumed that i had a breathing problem i was forced to use it once in the doctor’s office – after i came home i threw it away the next morning i woke up ninetenths dead – i felt really really badstrong my wife had left early in the morning on business and came home about four in the afternoon i thought i would be dead soon and i gave her all the passwords to our bank accounts later that day she and one of her friends took me to the nearest er which was about  miles away i guess i didn’t have enough money in the bank for her to let me die by this time i could not stand or walk without help i was kept overnight in the hospital and was scanned poked and prodded all night long i was seen by several doctors – one said he found nothing wrong another said my kidneys were failing and a third prescribed an asthma inhaler – the same brand and type as the first doctor i saw again i threw it away i was terrified – i assumed that my kidneys were failing and i didn’t think i’d last a week i tried to see the doctor i had seen earlier the morning i got out of the hospital just to get some answers but he didn’t see patients that day his receptionist was rather rude about it – see him later in the week or go back to the er after some searching my wife found a doctor that would see me he looked at the er and hospital records and declared that my kidneys were not failing that i did not have asthma or need an inhaler and there was nothing wrong with me except some mild arthritis i pointed out that i could not stand or walk without help and slept  out of the  hours in a day so there obviously was something wrong i was sent to a clinic where they took several tubes of blood and then my wife took me home and i slept after several days the doctor told my wife that all the blood tests turned up negative but he scheduled some more blood tests and a thyroid biopsy and some sort of nerve test where they stick needles into you and run electric current – he warned me it would be somewhat painful my wife took me to get the second round of blood tests the technician had trouble finding a vein and i went out like a light when i woke up a nurse in the er was cutting my clothes off when i woke up she told me “you are the most excitement we have had all day” apparently i had been out for quite a while and had turned a rather dark shade of green according to my wife she thought that i had died the er doctor asked me what my problem was since the blood tests requested were rather unusual i told him that i didn’t know he told me that i was unusually weak and dehydrated and most emphatically told me not to have any invasive procedures done until i had regained some strength because they could easily kill me they kept me at the er for about four hours my wife took me home and immediately cancelled all of the scheduled biopsies and tests the next day against my protestations she hauled me to an alternative medicine clinic run by a licensed md that had gotten fed up with the conventional medical practices at this time i strongly did not believe in “alternative medicine” the first thing that became apparent is that the doctor and his staff actually listened to me and asked detailed questions covering every detail of what i was going through and asked my opinion of what was going on the following took place over a period of six months or more – i cannot remember exactly but it was a long time the first month or so i spent sleeping  out of  hours a day i won’t go into all of the treatments in detail with a few exceptions vitamins minerals and natural remedies one procedure that was done is called “live blood analysis” conventional practitioners now call this quackery – but it used to be a common practice  years ago and is stilled used by researchers i observed the entire procedure which basically consists of drawing a drop of blood and looking at it under a video microscope the result was somewhat disturbing – in addition to various “stuff” floating around in my blood – fat and uric acid crystals among other things  a significant number of my red blood cells looked like deflated balloons and starfish the technician told me that he did not know the cause or the cure but it was obvious something was stressing my blood cells and that i had a “leaky colon” now this is where the tyent comes in the alternative medicine doctor told me to drink at least  ounces of water a day plain water was good enough but ionized water would be better my wife had a friend who was selling kangen water ionizers she volunteered to provide me with ionized water to prove that it would do some good for months my wife would fetch ionized water for me at this time i was slowly getting better staying awake longer and going into work a few hours a week being somewhat skeptical about the ionized water i stopped drinking it for a week twice and drank tap water both times i could tell the difference – i started feeling worse very quickly when i stopped drinking it and got better when i started drinking the ionized water before i fell ill i was having trouble urinating – just getting old i supposed a few months after starting with the ionized water the difficulty urinating became less and less now it is not a problem anymore also i used to eat antacids like candy – i have always had an acid reflux problem over a relatively short period of time my acid reflux went away i seldom need antacid anymore i also found that the taste of the ionized water was very good filtered water and bottled water is just “bland” – the only way to describe it the ionized water is just more drinkable to me ok now it was clear to me that i needed my own water ionizer the price of the kangen ionizer was outrageous plus the technology was quite old – it works but very heavy and requires periodic cleaning i looked at a lot of brands and settled on the tyent because the price was affordable the technology more recent the selfcleaning feature and the lifetime warranty my wife bought the lady that was providing the kangen ionized water for me a very nice thank you gift i also looked into the technology of water ionizers on the internet a lot of educated people who should know better say it is quackery and you cannot “ionize water” because pure water is a nonconductor and in any case if you did succeed in putting ions in it they would just recombine and neutralize each other i remember a demonstration in physics class at ga tech the professor had a large glass plate capacitor which could be disassembled glass is a nonconductor he charged the capacitor up and carefully disassembled it he then shorted the conductive plates together to show that there was no charge on the plates he then passed the glass plate around the class he then reassembled the capacitor and drew a three inch arc from the conductive plates the purpose of the demonstration was to show that the charge in a capacitor is stored in the nonconductive dielectric ok i reasoned now replace the glass with water – a water capacitor charge up the conductive plates the water next to one plate will have an excess of electrons the water next to the other plate will have a dearth of electrons now quickly remove the water next to each plate – the water next to one plate will be stuck with an excess of electrons the water next to the other plate will suffer from a lack of electrons the purer the water the better this works in any case i was clear to me those on the internet – some who are phds – that argue that there is no such thing as ionized water should call their university and ask for their money back for giving them such a poor education in physics in any case i not only satisfied myself that not only do water ionizers actually put a charge into the water but that alkaline water is actually very good for you after six or seven months of alternative medical treatment including copious amounts of ionized water i begin to become my old irascible self again at the insistences of my wife i had another live blood analysis this time all of my red blood cells were nice round like they are supposed to be no fat in the blood no uric acid crystals or anything else that was not supposed to be there objective proof that the treatments prescribed by the alternative medicine physician actually had an effect in about a year after i first became ill i was able to begin seriously exercising again i had gained  pounds over this period – doing nothing but sleeping and eating is not particularly good for you i was too heavy to start jogging again plus my leg muscles had atrophied i started riding a recumbent tadpole tricycle not what you think – it is a lean mean speed machine if you are man enough to pedal it i started out barely being able to go  mph – now i can hold mph on the flats in summary i’m now  years old i can pee again i lost the  extra pounds i regularly ride centurys on my recumbent trike faster than a lot younger folks on expensive diamond frame bikes – today i knocked off a  mile very hilly ride with the local bike club i will be riding the capcap century richmond to williamsburg in may i still have my tyent i bought years ago it still works great and my wife and i still religiously drink the ionized water from it what caused me to fall so seriously ill i never found out – perhaps it was a pollen allergy  the day i was jogging was a severe pollen day – i probably will never know as to the extent that ionized water played in my recovery i can only say that it very noticeably made a difference as to what role it plays today in my overall health i cannot say but i feel great and i can pee again and i do not have an acid reflux problem i still drink copious amounts of alkaline water and you could not pull my tyent away from me with elephants i also have become a firm believer in alternative medicine i am convinced conventional medicine would have literally biopsied me and drugged me to death and after the autopsy they would have told my wife what killed me it can be argued that i eventually would have recovered on my own if left alone but three things are clear to me – conventional medical practices would have either killed me or left me disabled and on expensive prescription drugs the alternative medicine at worst did no harm and i’m convinced that it worked and the ionized water makes me feel better and seems to have largely eliminated my lifelong acid reflux problem dr nancy mcclellandc dipl ac “tyent water™ along with all of its other benefits neutralizes free radicals in a very effective manner” one of the important features of drinking tyent water™ is the orp quotient that is the oxidation reduction potential and the power the water has to go into your body and neutralize free radicals if people realize that free radicals attack number  nerve tissue number  brain tissue number  cell walls they might take orp a little more seriously tyent water along with all of its other benefits neutralizes free radicals in a very effective manner the most important things we can do is to drink tyent alkaline water because it flushes out the part of your body called the ground substance or the matrix where all of your cells sit in it’s where everything happens in your body the only thing that i have found that cleanses the ground substance is alkaline water so i consider alkaline ionized water from a tyent machine one of the most important things a person can do for themselves and their family’s health franci crownoble “it keeps my blood pressure down  i no longer have arthritis in my knees” tyent ionized alkaline water has been very beneficial to my health  it keeps my blood pressure down  i no longer have arthritis in my knees the unit is easy to use  tastes great  i also appreciate all of the other levels of acid or alkaline water it allows me to use franci crownoble cottonwood arizona connie cochran “i went with tyent usa and i‘m so glad i did” my first experience with ionized water was when a representative demonstrated it at a home show  i thought i knew all there was to know about it’s purposes in life after all  i’d be on this planet for nearly  years  little did i know there was a big surprise awaiting me  all water is definitely not created equal “all water is definitely not created equal” i always prided myself in not drinking excessive amounts of sweet soft drinks  i even made a switch from an occasional soda to a large amount of carbonated tap water that i made myself at home  what could be better than lots of homemade carbonated water i began getting acid reflux that was beyond being resolved with overthecounter products  my doctor gave be a prescription to help the demonstrator at the home show made a huge impression on me  he had some family members and other people who had ionized systems in their own homes come to the show that weekend  they all looked very healthy especially their skin i went home and did some extensive research on the computer i was definitely on a mission   i already knew i  was going to have this water in my home easily accessible to drink every single day to me it was necessary to compare equipment capabilities along with prices and reviews written by people who use the machine in my research i came across a remarkable video showing colon comparisons of those that did and did not drink alkaline water  there were before and after photos of those that made the switch generally i’m not one to share “colon pictures” with my friends but this was a must “i’m so glad i went with tyent” i made the decision to go with tyent usa because of a comparison video the price and their warranty  and i‘m so glad i did it was truly the beginning of a life changing experience this is a wonderful piece of equipment and really should be a “must have” for everyone i’m amazed i hadn’t heard about it before  the choice i made was the tyent  turbo it has the capability to do both extremes very alkaline and very acidic i’ve found many purposes for both  my friends love it when i take them turbo acidic water  all of our bathrooms are sterilized and the glass is spotless not to mention the floors “the acid reflux completely resolved itself”  during  the first few weeks of my switch to water from my tyent  turbo the acid reflux completely resolved itself  the weight seemed to be going down  no longer did i need pain or antiinflammatory medication several times a day  my skin and hair improved  even the dental hygienist noticed a difference in the buildup on my teeth at my semiannual cleaning appointment  after about  months i just happened on to a book called “the beauty detox solution” by kimberly snyder certified nutritionist  as i read the book i began the second phase of my wonderful alkaline future learning that “obesity is an acid problem” i began following her suggestions to eat alkaline food along with my already newly found friend ionized alkaline water  only then did i realize that most of my life i’ve been overfed and undernourished causing me to carry around a terrible amount of excess weight  “the weight loss is remarkable” what a wonderful combination  alkaline water and alkaline food  i cannot wait to go back to my physician in early june the weight loss is remarkable and when my doctor reviews the blood work  he won’t have to write prescriptions for inflammation or for acid reflux any longer i drink  to  quarts of this wonderful tyent water™ every day  i only wish i’d learned about it when i was younger    but then there are some people who never learn about it i am grateful this important information came my way and    thank you tyent usa celebrate life…with water connie cochran florida dr joe fawcettdc “the tyent machine performs far above anything else that is out there” one of the elements that is so key and vital in anybody’s health is their ph and we want to achieve a slightly alkaline ph in the body i have looked at a lot of different water ionizer machines and i found the one that truly is the best the tyent machine performs far above anything else that is out there r brouser i have suffered from severe arthritis and fibromyalgia for decades but thank god i discovered alkaline water from tyent it has changed my life completely i live in the subarctic of alaskas interior where it is severely cold down to  degrees in the winter and very dark less than  hours of daylight in the winter too i have seen many doctors to get relief from my disorders and they all have told me to move somewhere warm and sunny take lots of pills for pain and muscle relaxation and dont exercise it will flare up the fibromyalgia i first heard about the concept of making your body alkaline from my best friend her integrative medicine doctor told her to eat certain foods to make her body more alkaline she told me many sicknesses cannot live in an alkaline environment when i searched methods to become more alkaline they all involved specialized and fairly expensive food plans it was a lot to grasp since i am already severely reactive to over  food allergens and have to carefully avoid otherwise healthy foods and then i found out about alkaline water all i had to do was drink it how simple could it be i bought a tyent  turbo and began drinking a gallon a day i picked tyent due to their strong medical recognition in korea for over  years and lifetime product warranty about  weeks after starting the tyent alkaline water my worst arthritis symptoms abated it will be  years next month and the pain has not returned when i told my doctor that my arthritis abated since drinking alkaline water he looked at me and said disdainfully you are kidding me you of all people are a medical social worker and should know the power of a fake placebo i got a different doctor the next doctor i found believed in holistic medicine and ran some blood tests and xrays to see how bad the arthritis was in my hands the tests in  showed there was no inflammation in my blood at all and the pain has been long gone there was no other intervention but tyent alkaline water to give the credit to  i have told many friends about the alkaline water one friend had fibromyalgia like i do i brought her a gallon of water every day within a month she told me her fibro pain had disappeared i was shocked i still had a lot of pain then it dawned on me that i was told to not exercise and i hadnt in years if i didnt exercise how would i know if the water could take away muscle pain i started physical therapy over the last year and a half i have gotten to  miles on my treadmill and many exercises each day i havent hurt at all after working out i have some continued general fatigue and mild pain but not related to my physical therapy amazing of course i guzzle close to a gallon every day the water seems to wick away whatever waste materials that normally cause my fibromyalgia pain from exercise since then i have lost  pounds and  dress sizes too thank god for tyent alkaline water”

wwwislandstocktransfercom  reasons alkaline water co will soon crash  alkaline water company inc the otcmktswter  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo» reasons alkaline water co will soon crashaug  about alkaline water wter microcap fraud alert editors note this article covers a microcap stock please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks in the past month the stock of a previously unknown issuer the alkaline water company otcqbwter has taken investors for a ride wterob has risen from  to  amidst a flurry of hyperbolic press releases issued by the company exhibit a below but i believe this hotly touted stock could be due for a crash in the not too distant future reason  the product sucks essentially the product is water water in an ugly bulk plastic container the company claims to employ a stateoftheart electrochemically activated water system to create  ph drinking water without the use of any chemicals but away from the glitz and glamour of the corporate marketing materials their k filing concedes health benefits of alkaline water are not guaranteed and have not been proven there is a perception that consuming alkaline water has beneficial health effects how or why anyone requires exactly  ph level water neatly named alkaline is beyond me but i wont waste time debating the advantages or disadvantages of certain minerals or ph levels because alkaline fails on other levels alkaline fails in product strategy the tout sheet claims selling water in one gallon or liter jugs is an advantage because there is no competition but did it occur to management that there is no competition in this subniche because there is no gap in the market for bulk buying plain water the effort it would take to carry to liter jug home from a shopping trip simply far outweighs the supposed benefits items like vitamin water are impulse purchases when on the go its a second decision you walk past a convenience store and grab it on your way to the office or after the gym but alkaline has another achilles heel the product proposition is weak its water it looks and tastes exactly like what comes out of my refrigerator for free the demand for bulk purchases of ph modified water simply does not exist and as well see below wter does not have the marketing budget to create the demand reason  the company is vastly overvalued using the word valuation is perhaps a disservice to the art of security analysis but ill persevere as of writing wter has  common shares outstanding which at  gives us a  million dollar market capitalization of the common in my experience to support such a market cap a company would require roughly m in net income or  eps what does wter bring to the table ahem heres where things get tricky wter has such small income statement numbers that dividing them by the massive  million sharecount takes the per share numbers into fractions of pennies example wter has negative net income so we will obligingly jump up the income statement and take their gross profit in the last quarter it was a rather pitiful  yeah thats fourteen thousand dollars umm yeah this isnt ebitda folks this is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and pretty much every other expense save for the electro charged water on a per share basis thats  in gross profit last quarter total revenues  thirty two thousand dollars i know amway distributors who gross more than this reason  the management are part timers in an k filed on june th the company discloses a bizarre risk factor the management are part timers because our officers and directors will not be devoting a majority of their time to our operations and will only be devoting limited amounts of time to our development and operations completion of our business development may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to our officer and director bull case bulls say this company is entering an exciting niche consumer beverages that has in recent past been a source of superior stock market returns the press releases shown in exhibit a do hint alkaline may be gaining traction which will show in the next quarter furthermore if akaline can gain traction the market may reward wterob with a nice multiple with that said i believe the main driver of the recent performance in wterob stock price is the rampant online touting and press releases rather than any fundamental interest in the underlying conclusion wter shares have risen from  to  based on an explosion of corporate press releases and online tout sheets runrate annual revenues based on the last quarter stand at just  one hundred and thirty thousand dollars which pales in comparison to the  million dollar valuation the market is currently giving wter even if wter was worth x revenues or  it is still trading at x this overly generous valuation my advice caveat emptor buyers of wter are playing musical chairs and you dont want to be around when the music stops exhibit a in just the past  days the

imagine having the ability to take normal tap water and give it a special charge that can neutralize free radicals and give you the benefits mentioned above alkaline ionized water or tyent water™ has a negative charge called oxidation reduction potential orp the orp properties of alkaline water are known by many as simply “antioxidants” to explain further normal body functions cause high or rising oxidation in the body which is not good to fight against the oxidation alkaline water’s negative orp charge literally hinders the oxidation process by counteracting any rising oxidation effect ionized water essentially rejuvenates us a glass of alkaline water brings us as close as we can ever hope to get to a fountain of youth as incredible as that may sound is having gallons of alkaline water flowing freely just a dream not any more the purest freshest and healthiest alkaline water is also ionized and it is created by a tyent water ionizer that hooks to your tap  hide “the tyent machine performs far above anything else that is out there”  dr joe fawcett dc alkaline water vs regular water—a true story by michele steffney alkaline water expert who wants the best water on earth i do i do does it exist yes absolutely it is tyent ionized alkaline water but before you just take my word for it let’s break it down by one type of water at a time first let me just explain a bit about my experience with water when i was about  years old…  read more of my alkaline water story i used to see culligan commercials these commercials used scare tactics that showed all of the dangerous contaminants in your tap water whoa they were scary i remember going to my dad about it and he just shrugged his shoulders and pretty much ignored me i suppose it did not scare him but it definitely sparked an interest in me and a mission to find the healthiest water on earth luckily for all of us water has come a long way since those commercials today there are loads of ways to get your water and new ways popping up daily let’s take a quick trip down memory lane shall we  the obvious classics since the prehistoric days include water from natural lakes rivers or springs  well water  city water  bottled distilled water for use in chemistry and other applications not for drinking  bottled spring water  bottled purified water  flavored waters with fizz and without  gravity pitchers  basic household filters including whole house systems faucet filters and water softeners  reverse osmosis systems  nonelectric alkalizersionizers  electric water ionizer machines choices choices and more choices but don’t fret because since many of the choices listed do not meet our standards let’s not waste time since our goal is to find the healthiest water the natural choices such as rivers and streams can be eliminated right away because of pollution moving on we will eliminate nontreated well water since it needs to be further filtered and of course any basic filter just won’t meet our high expectations now that those subpar water choices are out of the way let’s concentrate on what’s left and what’s still questionably healthy alkaline water vs bottled water as funny as it may seem i still see people loading large plastic wrapped crates of bottled water into their shopping carts i feel sorry that so many people still do not know that they would probably be better off just drinking unfiltered tap water sad but true in most cases although there are a few very expensive semihealthy bottled water brands on the market most of the bottled water companies take plastic bottles and fill them with plainold filtered tap water some of it is packed in such cheap plastic containers that you can smell or even taste plastic when you drink it does this plasticsmelling water sound healthy to you i didn’t think so besides it’s not good for the environment or your pocketbook either to top it off most bottled water is surprisingly acidic and some can even be contaminated with microorganisms that grow from inventory that sits for so long in hot trucks pretty gross and very inconvenient if you ask me furthermore who has the space for all of those clunky bottles anyway score for bottled water alkaline water vs tap water to me this topic is a no brainer but who am i to judge to start tap water is mandated to have neutral ph which from a ph standpoint is okay—meaning it’s not going to harm you but it won’t help you either for me i want to drink a healthy ph of  to  to help keep my body better balanced however i want more than just a healthy ph and you should too here’s what you are missing when you drink tap water over alkaline water a healthy ph better hydration  since it does not go through an electrolysis process purity  most tap water has contaminants see what’s in your water here in tyent’s free water report antioxidants  there is nothing in tap water to help keep your body from dangerously oxidizing score for tap water alkaline water from a water ionizer vs bottled alkaline water if you are traveling or in a pinch then bottled alkaline water is just fine the ph is usually sufficient however it costs up to  a bottle or more which in my book is way too much to pay especially since it’s not as highquality as the ionized water that comes fresh from a tyent unit when bottled alkaline water is manufactured there is a packaging process that is required by law that kills the healthy antioxidant properties of the water so since the antioxidant properties are one of the top reasons to drink ionized alkaline water it fails in my book there are some regions of exception due to municipal source water score for bottled alkaline water overall analysis water from an electric water ionizer is still the best choice it has all of the healthy properties your body needs so in my book it’s really the only choice score for alkaline water from a water ionizer  hide which alkaline water system is bestwe can help you find the toprated water ionizer water

key topics that will be covered here the hassle of buying bottled alkaline water the hassle of buying alkaline water is based on the lack of convenience in many regions bottled alkaline water is only sold through health food stores or can only be found online therefore you will need to take an extra trip or step to purchase it aside from making a special trip you will also need to load it into your cart lug it back to your car drag it into your home and then store it until you need it avoid the inconvenience of the load lug and store syndrome and just push a button on your ionizer when you want a fresh glass of alkaline water the cost of buying bottled alkaline water the cost of buying bottled alkaline water is about  times more than the cost of owning a water ionizer a glass of water from a tyent water ionizer costs about  cents a glass plus you will not have to pay for the gas to make that special trip to the health food store just to buy it or pay the high cost of shipping the environmental cost of buying bottled alkaline water has a high price tag as well there are a lot of hidden costs and environmental factors that you may have not considered like these the cost of fuel used to make and transport the plastic bottles the energy used for manufacturing the cost of fuel in transporting heavy liquids in bottles across the country to distributors the cost of your fuel to transport the bottles to your home the cost of recycling or the environmental cost from taking up more landfill space slash the huge price tag into bits by purchasing a tyent water ionizer that will save you a lot of money plus owning a tyent machine is very ecofriendly the shortcomings of buying bottled alkaline water the shortcomings of buying bottled alkaline water over owning a water ionizer are vast aside from the whopping costs and tremendous hassles of buying bottled alkaline water you will not get the same health benefits either sure bottled alkaline water is healthier than ordinary bottled water but it does not have as many antioxidants as alkaline water that is fresh from your water ionizer plus you are limited to the ph level that comes in the bottle whereas with a tyent unit

hydrogen in ionized water the presence of hydrogen gas gives ionized alkaline water many of its benefits ionized water is produced by electrolysis enabling the ‘free’ and available hydrogen gas to dissolve into the water it is the presence of hydrogen gas which gives alkaline water many of it’s benefits research has shown that removing the hydrogen gas in ionized water diminishes the benefits and perhaps unsurprisingly adding extra hydrogen gas to the water increased the therapeutic benefits drinking hydrogenrich alkaline water is the perfect way to mount a defense against free radicals which are responsible for oxidization – or decay – within our bodies is alkaline water good or bad since alkaline water has such a high antioxidant content and because so many doctors recommend antioxidants it is very good for you when you compare alkaline water to orange juice you will find that fresh squeezed orange juice has a negative orp of  and we can only drink a few glasses of fresh orange juice per day we can drink as much ionized water as we wish to in a day plus unlike orange juice ionized alkaline water has no calories many people drink as much as two gallons of ionized water per day for their health so how much alkaline water does your body need read more alkaline water ionizer benefits ionized alkaline water will contain thousands of tiny bubbles when it pours out of a tyent water ionizer those bubbles are molecular hydrogen which is the antioxidant property of ionized alkaline water molecular hydrogen is the most fragile aspect of ionized water lasting only a

while ph gets all the attention it is the oxidation reduction potential “orp” that is important to improving and maintaining your health the antioxidants orp is a measure of the electrical charge in the water and plays a key role in eliminating acid from the body which in turn helps raise the ph of the body and allows the body to heal itself your body performs the miracles not the water the water

with the ionizer plates makes a difference so look for large plates and at least  of them the brand that you choose can play a major role in determining performance by having more plates larger plates and solidmesh hybrid plates  pay attention to the amount of amps that run through the actual plates during the ionization process here’s a simple checklist for purchasing a water ionizer the amount of amps that is passed over the plates the size of the plates the number of plates should be at least  the quality of the materials of the plates platinum coated titanium is safest and most durable

was a struggle i came home and went to bed after a week of being too fatigued to go to work i went to see the local doctor i was told that there appeared to be nothing wrong – and was prescribed an asthma inhaler to help me breath i didn’t and don’t have asthma and i didn’t have a problem breathing i presume because i told the doctor that i was running at the onset of my fatigue he assumed that i had a breathing problem i was forced to use it once in the doctor’s office – after i came home i threw it away the next morning i woke up ninetenths dead – i felt really really badstrong my wife had left early in the morning on business and came home about four in the afternoon i thought i would be dead soon and i gave her all the passwords to our bank accounts later that day she and one of her friends took me to the nearest er which was about  miles away i guess i didn’t have enough money in the bank for her to let me die by this time i could not stand or walk without help i was kept overnight in the hospital and was scanned poked and prodded all night long i was seen by several doctors – one said he found nothing wrong another said my kidneys were failing and a third prescribed an asthma inhaler – the same brand and type as the first doctor i saw again i threw it away i was terrified – i assumed that my kidneys were failing and i didn’t think i’d last a week i tried to see the doctor i had seen earlier the morning i got out of the hospital just to get some answers but he didn’t see patients that day his receptionist was rather rude about it – see him later in the week or go back to the er after some searching my wife found a doctor that would see me he looked at the er and hospital records and declared that my kidneys were not failing that i did not have asthma or need an inhaler and there was nothing wrong with me except some mild arthritis i pointed out that i could not stand or walk without help and slept  out of the  hours in a day so there obviously was something wrong i was sent to a clinic where they took several tubes of blood and then my wife took me home and i slept after several days the doctor told my wife that all the blood tests turned up negative but he scheduled some more blood tests and a thyroid biopsy and some sort of nerve test where they stick needles into you and run electric current – he warned me it would be somewhat painful my wife took me to get the second round of blood tests the technician had trouble finding a vein and i went out like a light when i woke up a nurse in the er was cutting my clothes off when i woke up she told me “you are the most excitement we have had all day” apparently i had been out for quite a while and had turned a rather dark shade of green according to my wife she thought that i had died the er doctor asked me what my problem was since the blood tests requested were rather unusual i told him that i didn’t know he told me that i was unusually weak and dehydrated and most emphatically told me not to have any invasive procedures done until i had regained some strength because they could easily kill me they kept me at the er for about four hours my wife took me home and immediately cancelled all of the scheduled biopsies and tests the next day against my protestations she hauled me to an alternative medicine clinic run by a licensed md that had gotten fed up with the conventional medical practices at this time i strongly did not believe in “alternative medicine” the first thing that became apparent is that the doctor and his staff actually listened to me and asked detailed questions covering every detail of what i was going through and asked my opinion of what was going on the following took place over a period of six months or more – i cannot remember exactly but it was a long time the first month or so i spent sleeping  out of  hours a day i won’t go into all of the treatments in detail with a few exceptions vitamins minerals and natural remedies one procedure that was done is called “live blood analysis” conventional practitioners now call this quackery – but it used to be a common practice  years ago and is stilled used by researchers i observed the entire procedure which basically consists of drawing a drop of blood and looking at it under a video microscope the result was somewhat disturbing – in addition to various “stuff” floating around in my blood – fat and uric acid crystals among other things  a significant number of my red blood cells looked like deflated balloons and starfish the technician told me that he did not know the cause or the cure but it was obvious something was stressing my blood cells and that i had a “leaky colon” now this is where the tyent comes in the alternative medicine doctor told me to drink at least  ounces of water a day plain water was good enough but ionized water would be better my wife had a friend who was selling kangen water ionizers she volunteered to provide me with ionized water to prove that it would do some good for months my wife would fetch ionized water for me at this time i was slowly getting better staying awake longer and going into work a few hours a week being somewhat skeptical about the ionized water i stopped drinking it for a week twice and drank tap water both times i could tell the difference – i started feeling worse very quickly when i stopped drinking it and got better when i started drinking the ionized water before i fell ill i was having trouble urinating – just getting old i supposed a few months after starting with the ionized water the difficulty urinating became less and less now it is not a problem anymore also i used to eat antacids like candy – i have always had an acid reflux problem over a relatively short period of time my acid reflux went away i seldom need antacid anymore i also found that the taste of the ionized water was very good filtered water and bottled water is just “bland” – the only way to describe it the ionized water is just more drinkable to me ok now it was clear to me that i needed my own water ionizer the price of the kangen ionizer was outrageous plus the technology was quite old – it works but very heavy and requires periodic cleaning i looked at a lot of brands and settled on the tyent because the price was affordable the technology more recent the selfcleaning feature and the lifetime warranty my wife bought the lady that was providing the kangen ionized water for me a very nice thank you gift i also looked into the technology of water ionizers on the internet a lot of educated people who should know better say it is quackery and you cannot “ionize water” because pure water is a nonconductor and in any case if you did succeed in putting ions in it they would just recombine and neutralize each other i remember a demonstration in physics class at ga tech the professor had a large glass plate capacitor which could be disassembled glass is a nonconductor he charged the capacitor up and carefully disassembled it he then shorted the conductive plates together to show that there was no charge on the plates he then passed the glass plate around the class he then reassembled the capacitor and drew a three inch arc from the conductive plates the purpose of the demonstration was to show that the charge in a capacitor is stored in the nonconductive dielectric ok i reasoned now replace the glass with water – a water capacitor charge up the conductive plates the water next to one plate will have an excess of electrons the water next to the other plate will have a dearth of electrons now quickly remove the water next to each plate – the water next to one plate will be stuck with an excess of electrons the water next to the other plate will suffer from a lack of electrons the purer the water the better this works in any case i was clear to me those on the internet – some who are phds – that argue that there is no such thing as ionized water should call their university and ask for their money back for giving them such a poor education in physics in any case i not only satisfied myself that not only do water ionizers actually put a charge into the water but that alkaline water is actually very good for you after six or seven months of alternative medical treatment including copious amounts of ionized water i begin to become my old irascible self again at the insistences of my wife i had another live blood analysis this time all of my red blood cells were nice round like they are supposed to be no fat in the blood no uric acid crystals or anything else that was not supposed to be there objective proof that the treatments prescribed by the alternative medicine physician actually had an effect in about a year after i first became ill i was able to begin seriously exercising again i had gained  pounds over this period – doing nothing but sleeping and eating is not particularly good for you i was too heavy to start jogging again plus my leg muscles had atrophied i started riding a recumbent tadpole tricycle not what you think – it is a lean mean speed machine if you are man enough to pedal it i started out barely being able to go  mph – now i can hold mph on the flats in summary i’m now  years old i can pee again i lost the  extra pounds i regularly ride centurys on my recumbent trike faster than a lot younger folks on expensive diamond frame bikes – today i knocked off a  mile very hilly ride with the local bike club i will be riding the capcap century richmond to williamsburg in may i still have my tyent i bought years ago it still works great and my wife and i still religiously drink the ionized water from it what caused me to fall so seriously ill i never found out – perhaps it was a pollen allergy  the day i was jogging was a severe pollen day – i probably will never know as to the extent that ionized water played in my recovery i can only say that it very noticeably made a difference as to what role it plays today in my overall health i cannot say but i feel great and i can pee again and i do not have an acid reflux problem i still drink copious amounts of alkaline water and you could not pull my tyent away from me with elephants i also have become a firm believer in alternative medicine i am convinced conventional medicine would have literally biopsied me and drugged me to death and after the autopsy they would have told my wife what killed me it can be argued that i eventually would have recovered on my own if left alone but three things are clear to me – conventional medical practices would have either killed me or left me disabled and on expensive prescription drugs the alternative medicine at worst did no harm and i’m convinced that it worked and the ionized water makes me feel better and seems to have largely eliminated my lifelong acid reflux problem dr nancy mcclellandc dipl ac “tyent water™ along with all of its other benefits neutralizes free radicals in a very effective manner” one of the important features of drinking tyent water™ is the orp quotient that is the oxidation reduction potential and the power the water has to go into your body and neutralize free radicals if people realize that free radicals attack number  nerve tissue number  brain tissue number  cell walls they might take orp a little more seriously tyent water along with all of its other benefits neutralizes free radicals in a very effective manner the most important things we can do is to drink tyent alkaline water because it flushes out the part of your body called the ground substance or the matrix where all of your cells sit in it’s where everything happens in your body the only thing that i have found that cleanses the ground substance is alkaline water so i consider alkaline ionized water from a tyent machine one of the most important things a person can do for themselves and their family’s health franci crownoble “it keeps my blood pressure down  i no longer have arthritis in my knees” tyent ionized alkaline water has been very beneficial to my health  it keeps my blood pressure down  i no longer have arthritis in my knees the unit is easy to use  tastes great  i also appreciate all of the other levels of acid or alkaline water it allows me to use franci crownoble cottonwood arizona connie cochran “i went with tyent usa and i‘m so glad i did” my first experience with ionized water was when a representative demonstrated it at a home show  i thought i knew all there was to know about it’s purposes in life after all  i’d be on this planet for nearly  years  little did i know there was a big surprise awaiting me  all water is definitely not created equal “all water is definitely not created equal” i always prided myself in not drinking excessive amounts of sweet soft drinks  i even made a switch from an occasional soda to a large amount of carbonated tap water that i made myself at home  what could be better than lots of homemade carbonated water i began getting acid reflux that was beyond being resolved with overthecounter products  my doctor gave be a prescription to help the demonstrator at the home show made a huge impression on me  he had some family members and other people who had ionized systems in their own homes come to the show that weekend  they all looked very healthy especially their skin i went home and did some extensive research on the computer i was definitely on a mission   i already knew i  was going to have this water in my home easily accessible to drink every single day to me it was necessary to compare equipment capabilities along with prices and reviews written by people who use the machine in my research i came across a remarkable video showing colon comparisons of those that did and did not drink alkaline water  there were before and after photos of those that made the switch generally i’m not one to share “colon pictures” with my friends but this was a must “i’m so glad i went with tyent” i made the decision to go with tyent usa because of a comparison video the price and their warranty  and i‘m so glad i did it was truly the beginning of a life changing experience this is a wonderful piece of equipment and really should be a “must have” for everyone i’m amazed i hadn’t heard about it before  the choice i made was the tyent  turbo it has the capability to do both extremes very alkaline and very acidic i’ve found many purposes for both  my friends love it when i take them turbo acidic water  all of our bathrooms are sterilized and the glass is spotless not to mention the floors “the acid reflux completely resolved itself”  during  the first few weeks of my switch to water from my tyent  turbo the acid reflux completely resolved itself  the weight seemed to be going down  no longer did i need pain or antiinflammatory medication several times a day  my skin and hair improved  even the dental hygienist noticed a difference in the buildup on my teeth at my semiannual cleaning appointment  after about  months i just happened on to a book called “the beauty detox solution” by kimberly snyder certified nutritionist  as i read the book i began the second phase of my wonderful alkaline future learning that “obesity is an acid problem” i began following her suggestions to eat alkaline food along with my already newly found friend ionized alkaline water  only then did i realize that most of my life i’ve been overfed and undernourished causing me to carry around a terrible amount of excess weight  “the weight loss is remarkable” what a wonderful combination  alkaline water and alkaline food  i cannot wait to go back to my physician in early june the weight loss is remarkable and when my doctor reviews the blood work  he won’t have to write prescriptions for inflammation or for acid reflux any longer i drink  to  quarts of this wonderful tyent water™ every day  i only wish i’d learned about it when i was younger    but then there are some people who never learn about it i am grateful this important information came my way and    thank you tyent usa celebrate life…with water connie cochran florida dr joe fawcettdc “the tyent machine performs far above anything else that is out there” one of the elements that is so key and vital in anybody’s health is their ph and we want to achieve a slightly alkaline ph in the body i have looked at a lot of different water ionizer machines and i found the one that truly is the best the tyent machine performs far above anything else that is out there r brouser i have suffered from severe arthritis and fibromyalgia for decades but thank god i discovered alkaline water from tyent it has changed my life completely i live in the subarctic of alaskas interior where it is severely cold down to  degrees in the winter and very dark less than  hours of daylight in the winter too i have seen many doctors to get relief from my disorders and they all have told me to move somewhere warm and sunny take lots of pills for pain and muscle relaxation and dont exercise it will flare up the fibromyalgia i first heard about the concept of making your body alkaline from my best friend her integrative medicine doctor told her to eat certain foods to make her body more alkaline she told me many sicknesses cannot live in an alkaline environment when i searched methods to become more alkaline they all involved specialized and fairly expensive food plans it was a lot to grasp since i am already severely reactive to over  food allergens and have to carefully avoid otherwise healthy foods and then i found out about alkaline water all i had to do was drink it how simple could it be i bought a tyent  turbo and began drinking a gallon a day i picked tyent due to their strong medical recognition in korea for over  years and lifetime product warranty about  weeks after starting the tyent alkaline water my worst arthritis symptoms abated it will be  years next month and the pain has not returned when i told my doctor that my arthritis abated since drinking alkaline water he looked at me and said disdainfully you are kidding me you of all people are a medical social worker and should know the power of a fake placebo i got a different doctor the next doctor i found believed in holistic medicine and ran some blood tests and xrays to see how bad the arthritis was in my hands the tests in  showed there was no inflammation in my blood at all and the pain has been long gone there was no other intervention but tyent alkaline water to give the credit to  i have told many friends about the alkaline water one friend had fibromyalgia like i do i brought her a gallon of water every day within a month she told me her fibro pain had disappeared i was shocked i still had a lot of pain then it dawned on me that i was told to not exercise and i hadnt in years if i didnt exercise how would i know if the water could take away muscle pain i started physical therapy over the last year and a half i have gotten to  miles on my treadmill and many exercises each day i havent hurt at all after working out i have some continued general fatigue and mild pain but not related to my physical therapy amazing of course i guzzle close to a gallon every day the water seems to wick away whatever waste materials that normally cause my fibromyalgia pain from exercise since then i have lost  pounds and  dress sizes too thank god for tyent alkaline water”   michael mckenry catcher tampa bay rays “you gotta look into this alkaline water it’ll do dividends for your life when it
