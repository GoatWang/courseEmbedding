partners inc from april  through august  the fund�s portfolio managers manage multiple accounts for the adviser including registered closedend funds and private domestic and offshore pooled investment vehicles potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the portfolio managers� management of the fund and other accounts�for example conflicts of interest may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation of limited investment opportunities�allocations of investment opportunities generally could raise a potential conflict of interest to the extent that the portfolio managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are expected to increase in value to preferred accounts�conversely a portfolio manager could favor one account over another in the amount or the sequence in which orders to redeem investments are placed�the portfolio managers may be perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other accounts in addition to the fund that they are managing on behalf of the adviser�in addition each portfolio manager could be viewed as having a conflict of interest to the extent that one or more portfolio managers have an investment in accounts other than the fund�a potential conflict of interest may also arise if the adviser receives a performancebased advisory fee from one account but not another because a portfolio manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee whether or not the performance of that account directly determines the portfolio manager�s compensation�the adviser periodically reviews the portfolio managers� overall responsibilities to ensure that they are able to allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the fund other accounts may have investment objectives strategies and risks that differ from those of the fund�for these or other reasons the portfolio managers may purchase different investments for the fund and the other accounts and the performance of investments purchased for the fund may vary from the performance of the investments purchased for other accounts�the portfolio managers may place transactions on behalf of other

goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of its clients while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly�the adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures including brokerage and trade allocation policies and procedures that it believes address the conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients�in addition the

amount of a portfolio manager�s discretionary bonus and the portion to be paid in shares of funds managed by the adviser or in shares of stock or stock options of ubs ag is determined by senior officers of the adviser�in general the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination of factors none of which is necessarily weighted more than any other factor�these factors may include the overall performance of the adviser�the overall performance of ubs ag the profitability to the adviser derived from the management of the fund and the other accounts managed by the adviser the absolute
