together it then algorithmically decides which url is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results you can help google recognize the best url by using the rel”canonical” taguse the url parameters tool in google search console to tell google how your url parameters affect page content and how to to crawl urls with parameters use
