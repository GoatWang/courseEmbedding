arts style travel jobs real estate autos a controversial man in an eccentric place by carol vogel published april   merion pa— mention richard h glantons name to any student or former student at the barnes foundation or to anyone connected with the art world or pennsylvania politics and you may hear a string of expletives that would make a longshoreman blush mr glantons tenure as president of the barnes foundation which began in  and runs through  has produced several court cases every day barnes students distribute pamphlets outside the foundations building here on the philadelphia main line the latest is entitled grand scam how the trustees faked it renovation budgets and other hoaxes a billboard on nearby conshohocken road accuses the foundation of violating a public trust it was paid for by augustus f brown a retired college professor who said he was glad to spend  to educate the public the yearold mr glanton seems unfazed at being perceived as a public enemy his manner is smug his speech direct you could go off the deep end if you get emotional about all this he said in his office at the foundation a cozy sunfilled space that was once a sitting room clad in an impeccable blue suit hermes tie suspenders and gucci loafers he looked like something out of central casting for a wall streettype film about politics part of mr glantons cool exterior comes from knowing that for better or worse he will soon be credited as the man who put the barnes foundation on the map when great french paintings from the barnes foundation opens at the national gallery of art in washington next month and then travels to museums in paris tokyo and philadelphia thousands upon thousands of people will be able to see important works by artists like picasso matisse manet monet cezanne and renoir that have never before left their pennsylvania home from its inception in  the barnes foundation has been an eccentric place and sparked highly charged emotions its founder albert c barnes a manufacturer of patent medicines amassed a remarkable collection of about  paintings and  sculptures in  he began to house them in his new home which for tax purposes was called the foundations administrative building the collection includes about  renoirs  cezannes and  picassos canvases said to be by titian giorgione veronese and el greco some attributions have been disputed hang alongside major paintings by matisse seurat van gogh and manet in crowded idiosyncratic arrangements that also include french gothic colonial and spanish hardware porcelains and a mixture of furniture the unconventional method of display reflects barness personal mission  to teach people to look at art in a less rarefied way than scholars do and to see the relationship of painting to daily life he described the foundation as a place for plain people that is men and women who gain their livelihood by daily toil hostile to most of the art world he prevented important collectors like walter p chrysler jr and scholars like meyer schapiro and kenneth clark from viewing the collection only in  a decade after barness death and after the foundations taxexempt status had been challenged in court were its galleries opened to the public on a limited basis barnes stipulated in the foundations charter that no picture belonging to the collection shall ever be loaned sold or otherwise disposed of except that if any picture passes into a state of actual decay so that it is no longer of any value it may be removed for that reason only from the collection barnes tradition also decreed that no objects could be moved from their places in the galleries nor according to a rule established by violette de mazia a former education director of the foundation could color photographs be taken of any of the works in  a year before barnes died he unexpectedly turned the fate of the collection over to lincoln university a small predominantly black school about  miles from merion with no reputation for the study of art he gave the university the power to nominate new trustees as the old ones died or retired four of the five current board members were nominated by the university just how mr glanton a corporate lawyer whose art education consisted of a single college artappreciation course became president of the foundation is a matter of debate there are diametrically opposed versions of how it happened mr glanton who served on lincolns board for nearly six years describes the appointment as a fluke franklin williams was the president of the barnes when he died members of lincolns board nominated me two months later i became the barnes president it wasnt something i expected another version comes from richard l feigen a new york art dealer who sat on the lincoln board and the barnes art advisory committee a group formed to advise the barnes board on its holdings until he was asked to resign two years ago over a disagreement involving deaccessioning mr feigen insists that mr glantons appointment was calculated from the beginning his ambitions were purely political he said in fact franklin williams did everything he could to keep glanton off the barnes board but he finally managed to maneuver himself into the job    next page    inside nytimescom health raquo too hot to handle arts » the harmony of liberty opinion » should beach privatization be
