chairman of panther commented liquidity of our stock is paramount for this organization with only  shares freely tradable in our float and the rest of the shares outstanding are lockedup for up to  months we will utilize our ability to acquire topnotch developmental hematology products and move the pipeline forward to fast track our goals one of our main goals as a company is to have a liquid market for investors and uplisting to the nasdaq or nyse in the nearterm we look forward to expanding our pipeline and hitting the pavement to relay our story as the best young biotech on the market as a nonhodgkins lymphoma survivor myself its imperative that we get numonafide on the market to alleviate the stress being put on patients using toxic chemo therapeutics and we will have advanced discussions with the fda to accelerate development we aim to have a shareholders first mentality which means picking the best drugs keeping costs down spending capital to share our story and spend on value driven events and corporate actions to maximize shareholder appreciation since we dont have any approved products sales people or the ability to pay the traditional marketing spend of a mature biotechnology company yet we will spend a modest percentage of our capital on making this the best marketed biotechnology stock our team believes we have a potential molecule with an unlimited potential and upside in numonafide and potentially three more coming in over the next few months and we plan on being aggressive in our pursuits on all frontsabout panther biotechnology inc panther biotechnology is a newly formed entity focused on the acquisition and development of therapeutics for the treatment of leukemia lymphoma myeloma and other cancers the company will focus on identifying

in a timely manner in addition panther cannot ensure that clinical results related to invivo and invitro studies of numonafide will reproduce the positive results achieved to date panther cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial marketing of its treatment for patients with aml and there may be other treatments in development that are approved before

existing products repurposed approved products or new classes of drugs panther is also seeking other diversified business opportunities   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   unaudited interim consolidated financial statements   the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the rules of the securities and exchange commission sec and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the companys latest annual report filed with the sec on form k in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year  as reported in the form k have been omitted   basis of consolidation   the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiary all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in these consolidated financial statements   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates the company’s periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission include where applicable disclosures of estimates assumptions uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the company                cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which in the opinion of management are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value to be cash equivalents   intangible assets   intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated period of benefit we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization intangible assets having a capitalized cost of  were impaired during the year ended may   no impairment of intangible assets was identified for the three months ended august     impairment of longlived assets   the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical costcarrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate the company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset including eventual disposition if the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and estimated fair value   fair value of financial instruments   the company adopted the framework for measuring fair value that establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below   basis of fair value measurement     · level   observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   · level   inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or the liability or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means   · level   unobservable inputs reflect the company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value these assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available   the company believes that the fair value of its financial instruments comprising cash accounts payable and convertible notes approximate their carrying amounts as of august   and may   the company had no level  or level  financial assets or liabilities and level  financial assets consisted of the company’s derivative liability   the following table presents the fair value measurement information for the company as of august           carrying amount       level        level        level                                      derivative liability          –      –           the following table presents the fair value measurement information for the company as of may           carrying amount       level        level        level                                      derivative liability          –      –            income taxes   deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized                sharebased expenses   asc   compensation – stock compensation  prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all sharebased payment transactions in which employee services are acquired transactions include incurring liabilities or issuing or offering to issue shares options and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values that expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period   the company accounts for stockbased compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of asc   equity – based payments to nonemployees measurement of sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable a the goods or services received or b the equity instruments issued the fair value of the sharebased payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date   loss per share   basic loss per common share equals net loss divided by weighted average common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per share includes the impact on dilution from all contingently issuable shares including options warrants and convertible securities the common stock equivalents from contingent shares are determined by the treasury stock method the company incurred net losses for the three months ended august   and  and therefore basic and diluted loss per share for those periods are the same as all potential common equivalent shares would be antidilutive for the three months ended august   and  the company had  common stock warrants outstanding that were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would be antidilutive   recent accounting pronouncements   in april  the fasb issued asu no  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs and in august  issued asu no  presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements under asu  debt issuance costs reported on the consolidated balance sheet would be reflected as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset while asu  addresses costs related to term debt asu no  provides clarification regarding costs to secure revolving lines of credit which are at the outset not associated with an outstanding borrowing asu no  provides commentary that the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement the company has elected to implement asu no  early and the financial statements as of august   and  reflect the early adoption   the company does not expect the adoption of any other recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows   reclassifications   certain reclassifications may have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation   subsequent events   the company has evaluated all transactions through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued for subsequent event disclosure consideration   note  – going concern and liquidity considerations   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business as of august   the company has a cumulative net loss since inception of  negative working capital of  and is currently in default on its convertible debt the company has required additional capital raises and advances from shareholders to support its operations these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time the companys continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise sufficient capital to fund its operations until such time as it can generate revenues no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in these efforts   the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern              note  – commitments and contingencies   license agreement

company mr boyd guaranteed the due diligence and a financing of  should the company engage in the transaction with a short term guarantee of  simply to execute the term sheet the agreement that mr boyd negotiated required a final mutually agreed upon asset purchase agreement containing certain milestone achievements in the short term including but not limited to a filing of an s registration statement and applying for a listing on the nasdaq the acquisition consideration was  worth of the company’s common shares the guaranteed price of the first tranche of the blueprint partners financing was  per share the company believed the transaction to be of minimal risk however the initial failure of blueprint to deliver the financing of which an initial  was guaranteed with five days from the date of the signing of the term sheet resulted in the failure to achieve certain milestones per the term sheet which then subjected the company to a breakup fee of  the company takes the position that it is not liable if such fee were ever pursued due to the failure of blueprint to deliver the financing the company was unable to agree upon the terms of the asset purchase agreement as well as unable to achieve the milestones on a timely basis due to both alchemia withholding critical data and mr boyd improperly misrepresenting his ability to deliver the requisite financing concurrent with the execution of the term sheet in addition the company discovered questionable board relationships and practices amongst alchemia and mr boyd also certain statements and actions from alchemia appeared contradictory to the expectations of the relationship the company made every attempt to resolve the situation however the company suspects that possible collusion amongst the parties made the transaction absolutely impossible to consummate currently there is no negotiation or agreement in place the company believes it is entitled to damages and has initiated litigation against tim boyd and

considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee  lack of a majority of outside directors on our

objectives and  management dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating controls the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive and financial officer

management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee which has been rectified as of the filing date of this document and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors which has also been rectified by the filing date of this document results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which

company specializing in the development of enhanced therapeutics for the treatment of neoplastic and autoimmune disorders is pleased to announce today that it has entered into a definitive agreement with privately held faulk pharmaceuticals inc to acquire faulks pharmaceutical technology assets the transaction will provide panther biotechnology with a proprietary multinationally patent protected liganddrug conjugate technology platform as well as a pipeline of drug product candidates that address unmet medical needs in oncology autoimmune antiviral and other disease indications the lead development program is a liganddrug conjugate trfdox a combination of transferrin glycoproteins with doxorubicin for targeted delivery to tumors with the reduction of serious side effects clinical results demonstrate significant improvement over doxorubicin in a randomized double blind controlled study of patients with advanced figo stage iv ovarian cancer the addition of either trfdox or doxorubicin to conventional chemotherapy was compared treatment with trfdox resulted in a statistically significant increase in survival over doxorubicin in patients with drug resistant ovarian cancer in a nonblinded study in patients with acute leukemia trfdox was dosed at  of the usual dose and demonstrated an  decline in cancer cells circulating in the blood and no extension of the disease to bone marrow in  of the patients trfdox also exhibited a complete response of both the primary tumor and metastatic lesions in a patient with angiosarcoma after having failed three months of standard chemotherapy panther plans to submit applications for a phase  study in ovarian cancer and a phase a  b study in lung cancer trfdox leverages the targeting ability of the plasma protein transferrin to deliver a powerful chemotherapeutic payload to cancerous cells in vitro assays demonstrate growth inhibition of cancer cells that are resistant to other chemotherapies including doxorubicin itself cytotoxicity studies demonstrate that a dose reduction of ten to one hundredfold kills all cancer cells in multiple indications in vivo studies demonstrate that trfdox selectively binds tumors inhibits tumor growth better than unmodified doxorubicin and increases survival this improved therapeutic index suggests that further improvements in efficacy without added toxicity can be achieved under the terms of the agreement in exchange for substantially all the assets of faulk pharmaceuticals panther will issue shares of the common stock of panther biotechnology inc in addition to a tiered royalty payment agreement based on the achievement of specified revenue milestones for any commercialized products based on the acquired technology as part of the agreement panther will also
