track issues so i usually start by looking at jira to refresh my memory on what i was last working on and to see if there are any new bug reports bug fixes usually take priority over developing new features especially since they usually come up in a project which has a looming deadline the platform team meets daily for a short scrum to resolve any blocking issues  when i start work on a new feature or if i’m working on a bug fix i will spend time talking to the users of the platform to get requirements for the feature or to determine what went wrong q what is your goal at gns healthcare

to the users of the platform to get requirements for the feature or to determine what went wrong q what is your goal at gns healthcare  a my goal is to make the refs platform the best tool it can be

and i have almost  years’ experience teaching numerical analysis at the graduate level i learned about gns from a colleague at my former employer who knew colin from grad school  this was a couple of days after my former company went under  gns was less than a year old at the time and things moved at a fast pace  i called colin and had an interview either that day or the next and started working a few weeks later q what does your typical day look like  a the platform team uses jira to track issues so i usually start by looking at jira to refresh my memory on what i was last working on and to see if there are any new bug reports bug fixes usually take priority over developing new features especially since they usually come up in a project which has a looming deadline the platform team meets daily for a short scrum to resolve any blocking issues  when i start work on a new feature or if i’m working on a bug fix i will spend time talking to the users of the platform to get requirements for the feature or to determine what went wrong q what is your goal at gns healthcare  a my goal is to make the refs platform the best tool it can be in the features it provides and in its performance reliability and usability q why do you like working at gns a i enjoy working at gns because i get to work with some very smart people on challenging problems and the work we are doing can have a significant impact for good close mario accardi phd venture partner fort rock capital board observer mario is a venture partner at fort rock capital where he focuses on venture capital
