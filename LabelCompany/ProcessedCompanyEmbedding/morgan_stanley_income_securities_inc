across the board in a quarter where we saw fewer market events less client activity feels good morgan stanley reported earnings of  cents a share analysts had expected  cents up from  cents a year ago revenue of  billion was up from  billion in the second quarter of last year and well ahead of analyst expectations of  billion the bank run by chairman and chief executive james gorman is in the late stages of a multiyear turnaround that deemphasizes volatile trading businesses in favor of more stable assets and wealth management with the big pieces in place  buying citigroup incs smith barney brokerage slashing riskweighted assets and firing hundreds of fixedincome traders  the challenge now is to produce higher returns mr gorman has promised a  return on equity by yearend the figure stood at  in the quarter morgan stanley is the last of the large us banks to report earnings for the second quarter a threemonth stretch of calm markets that did little to jolt wall street businesses big

in trading revenue the smallest decline reported by any big bank this quarter at goldman whose securities business most closely resembles  and competes with  morgan stanleys trading revenue was off by  the figure that stands out is  billion from trading debt currencies and other fixedincome products that business is traditionally a laggard for morgan stanley with its smaller balance sheet and history of bungling risk but it has been performing better over the past year following a leadership shakeup that saw its top stock trader ted pick take over all of sales and trading this marks the fifth straight quarter of  billionplus revenue a bar set by mr gorman last year and once again tops goldman sachs which continues to struggle in fixedincome trading and posted a  decline in that business tuesday revenue was flat in stock trading morgan stanleys strength the firm has outmaneuvered peers in courting business from socalled quant hedge funds that trade huge volumes of stocks in

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
