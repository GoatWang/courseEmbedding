sankin  would you go to a restaurant to buy food someone made in their kitchen at home thats the question millions of californians are going to have to ask themselves now that a new law which went into effect on january  allows golden state residents to sell their own products at restaurants and grocery stores without going through the onerous process of getting a commercial kitchen license signed into law by california governor jerry brown last year the california homemade food act allows people to register themselves at cottage food operations after taking a food safety class passing a state examination paying a registration fee labeling their food as homemade and submitting their kitchens to an annual inspection the law is aimed at stimulating the growth of small businesses as well as increasing access to the types of healthy food options especially in lowincome and rural communities up until now people who wanted to turn their passion into a small business were faced with stifling red tape the bills author assemblyman mike gatto dlos angeles told capital public radio gatto introduced the bill after the bread los angelesarea amateur baker mark stambler sold to some local restaurants drew the ire of public heath officials if iwanted to sell bread in a store anywhere in los angeles county i basically have to own a wholesale food processing facility period stambler told southern california public radio noting that the costs for setting up a facility could easily reach hundreds of thousands of dollars there are some limitations on what home food producers are allowed to produce meat dairy and other perishable products are strictly offlimits the list of approved foods includes noncream filled goods candy dried fruit pastas granola roasted coffee jams jellies preserves and popcorn additionally since legislators didnt want the law to become a loophole through which largescale food producers could skirt health code regulations cottage operators have a revenue limit set at  rising to  in  and can only employ one fulltime equivalent worker at least  other states such as texas michigan and oregon have passed similar laws allowing small businesses to prepare nonhazardous food for sale in home kitchens also on huffpost suggest a correction aaron sankin assistant san francisco editor the huffington post more mike gatto mark stambler california food
