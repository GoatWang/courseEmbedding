statement  steven butlers genealogy website the morrison family biographies index the morrison family from new jersey to kentucky to texas by steven r butler phd introduction  john morrison  david morrison  isaac morrison  samuel h morrison  isaac f morrison  emmerine j morrison introduction i am related to the morrison family by virtue of the marriage of my maternal greatgrandfather william newton jenkins to emmerine morrison who was the daughter of isaac fisher morrison and his wife ada ann richardson morrison the morrison family is almost certainly scottish or scotsirish in origin although i do not know the names of my immigrant ancestors in this line it is a near certainty that they arrived in north america during the late s or earlytomid s a period of time during which thousands of other scottish and scotsirish immigrants crossed the atlantic settling largely in the appalachian region of the continent my morrison line has a history of residence in somerset county new jersey hardin county and edmonson county kentucky and lamar county texas john morrison abt abt  our earliest confirmable ancestor in this line is john morrison who was born according to some researchers about  place unknown it is possible although so far unproven that he may be our immigrant ancestor in this line at some point in his life he came to reside in or near the town of basking ridge somerset county new jerseywhich is situated in the northern part of the state just off presentday interstate  near bernardsville and the great swamp about eight miles south of morristown and also not very far from the morristown battlefield national historic park unfortunately our only known record of john morrison is his will dated  june  and proved in somerset county new jersey on  october  it identifies him as a yeoman which is another way of saying that he was a farmer john morrisons will which was witnessed by three neighborswilliam flin levi ayers and john roy names as heirs his wife margrete surname unknown and their nine children james sarah marey martha margrete agnes david isaac and john the last three are identified as being under age john morrisons estate real and personal including the family bible which was inventoried on  october  is shown as having a total value of �  pounds  shillings and sixpence the location of john morrisons grave is presently unknown neither is it known by how many years his wife margrete outlived him david morrison abt  david morrison son of john morrison and his wife margrete was born in new jersey probably in or near basking ridge somerset county about  on  november  when he was seventeen years of age a basking ridge neighbor named joseph kinnan was appointed his guardian two years later on  january  a man named william hamilton also of basking ridge was appointed guardian of sixteenyearold isaac morrison together with john hill of elizabethtown essex county as fellow bondsman and in  both david morrison and his older brother james were appointed guardians of their fourteenyearold brother john on  june james morrison then living in sussex county new jersey took over guardianship of isaac thomas anderson likewise a new jersey resident served as fellow bondsman in this detail from a  map of new jersey basking ridge is misidentified as baskeridge courtesy library of congress david morrisons precise whereabouts from  to a period of thirtysix years are uncertain although it is probable he continued to reside in new jersey during all or most of that time during the american revolution  james isaac and john morrison all served in new jersey regiments isaac who held the rank of captain particularly distinguished himself and was wounded in battle although david morrison was only thirtythree years old at the beginning of the war in  his name cannot be found on the roster of any new jersey regiment either he served some unit raised in a different state there is a david morrison listed on the roster of a new york regiment or he did not serve at all unfortunately david morrison did not live long enough to apply for a revolutionary war pension if he qualified for one this is unfortunate as a rule pension records provide more personal information about an individual than military service records sometime after reaching adulthood probably in the s david morrison married a young woman named mary surname unknown and together they had the following eight children not necessarily in birth order sally mary jesse isaac joel william elizabeth and jane sometime during or after the revolution davids brothers james and isaac went to kentucky where in  they were delegates to a convention held at danville where they joined in recommending that kentucky which was then a part of virginia be made into a separate state which was done on  june  in  isaac also became one of the original founders of elizabethtown the seat of hardin county kentucky unfortunately in  british soldiers burned a number of important public buildings in washington dc including the white house the capitol and the library of congress resulting in the destruction of the  census records for both new jersey and kentucky which was then a part of virginia there is also some speculation that the census forms were never actually forwarded to the capital at all and were simply lost in either event we cannot know if david morrison was still living in new jersey in  or if he had already made the journey west we can be reasonably sure however that after david morrison left new jersey he initially settled in lincoln county kentucky there on  december  his daughter jane married jonathan richardson on  april  daughter sally married amos richardson the twentythreeyearold son of william richardson both amos and william are also my ancestors the relationship of the abovenamed jonathan richardson to amos if any is presently uncertain this map of kentucky was made in the late s before hardin county and elizabethtown were established courtesy library of congress davids brother isaac morrison died in hardin county in  daniel lamson morrison identified in his will as isaacs only son afterward removed to ohio county kentucky where he is listed in the  census isaacs will also lists a james morrison as a friend who had come lately from the mississippi which is apparently a reference to someone unrelated although they shared the same last name and not to his and davids brother james although david morrison is not listed in the reconstructed second census of kentucky for  there is no question that he was then living in hardin county kentucky where a bond signed by him and jacob van metre or van meter junior on  june  is on file in the county clerks office the document remarks that on that date david morrison was sworn in as coroner of hardin county it is not known how long he held this position our next notice of david morrison is a deed dated either the nd or rd of august  in which it is recorded that he and his wife purchased  acres of land on rudes rhudes creek in hardin county from a david cox and his wife mathilda for which david and mary paid one hundred and fifty pounds current money of kentucky unfortunately the deed does not indicate whether the land was located on east rhudes creek or west rhudes creek the following year on  june  david and mary morrison sold  acres of their land to james morrison probably either davids older brother or isaacs friend from the mississippi for five shillings current money of kentucky sometime in  at the age of about sixtyfive david morrison died in hardin county cause of death is unknown and unfortunately the site of his grave has apparently been lost to history apparently he left no will his personal estate which was inventoried on  august included livestock of all kinds sheep cows hogs and horses a wagon a rifle gun household furniture a saddle tools of various kinds two spinning wheels and two beehives there is no mention of any books including a family bible which suggests that david morrison was illiterate which was not uncommon in those times the total value of his personal estate was approximately � more or less unfortunately some of the figures on the inventory sheet are difficult to read but the value was certainly no less than � mary morrison outlived her husband by more than a decade surviving well into the s the  federal census for hardin county kentucky records the names of both james morrison presumably davids brother and polly morrison who because polly was a typical nickname in that era for anyone named mary i believe may be the widow of david morrison there is a problem however the census also records that polly or mary had four male family members presumably her sons all of who were then between the ages of  to  and which would have included my twentyfouryearold ancestor isaac who should not be confused with his uncle isaac morrison who died in  but there is also one male listed in pollys household who is between the ages of  and  that makes a total of five males and mary morrison only had four sons furthermore the  federal census for hardin county kentucky also includes a jess morrison and a william morrison which are the names of two of marys four sons presently i am unable to account for these apparent anomalies i think it is worth mentioning that the  federal census for hardin county kentucky further records the residence of one thomas lincoln who at that time was the father of a oneyearold son named abraham although the  census only gives the fathers name while there is no reason to believe that we are related in any way to lincoln family there is no doubt that the thenfuture president and his parents were our ancestors neighbors it is therefore quite possible that they acquainted with one another abt  our earliest known ancestor in this line was isaac morrison who was born about  in new jerseyhis father was the aforementioned david morrison a resident of somerset county new jersey sometime during his childhood but no later than the age of twelve isaac migrated to kentucky with his parents and siblings although kentucky did not actually become a state until  americans had started settling the transappalachian west as early as the revolutionary war years kentucky was still mostly wilderness when the morrison family arrived there in the late eighteenth century consequently isaac morrison grew up on a frontier farm where he and his parents and his siblings almost certainly lived together in a crude log cabin which was a very commonplace type of abode at that time our earliest known public record of isaac morrison concerns a matter of some delicacy on  july  when he was twentysixyearsold isaac was called to the hardin county courthouse in elizabethtown to answer a charge of fathering a bastard child with a young woman named rachel watson when isaacs counsel name not shown in the record moved to have the case quashed the motion was overruled the following day after hearing testimony from both parties the court ruled that isaac is the father of the said bastard child charging him further with the payment of fiftyfive dollars for the support and maintenance of said child to be paid in annual installments every  july through the year  obviously having no choice in the matter isaac came into court and entered into and acknowledged his bond in the penalty of onehundred and ten dollars with jesse morrison his security conditioned agreeable to the above order a few months later in february  john van meter spelled van matre in the marriage records of hardin county married rachel watson and presumably took her child whose name age and sex are not noted in the court records to raise as his own this is currently speculationno further record of the child has been sought what makes this case all the more interesting is that on the very same day  july  he first appeared in court regarding the child he fathered with rachel watson isaac morrison and his thenfuturefatherinlaw samuel haycraft a pioneer settler of hardin county and one of the founders of elizabethtown posted a bond with the county court in the sum of fifty pounds united states currency the bond was a legal requirement that preceded his marriage to haycrafts twentyyearold daughter elizabeth or betsy born march   one cannot help but wonder what the bridetobe thought about her future husbands indiscretion with rachel watson or what rachel thought about isaac marrying another young woman instead of her the actual marriage took place six days later on  july  over the next several years isaac and betsy morrison had the following ten children all of who are named in his will and each one of which was almost certainly born in hardin county kentucky samuel haycraft morrison born about  died after  probably in edmonson county kentucky margaret or peggy morrison born about  died after  probably in kentucky lucretia morrison born about  died after  probably in kentucky worden polk morrison born november   married susan hodges born january   died june   in hardin county kentucky malvina c morrison born about  died after  probably in rusk county texas letitia y morrison born about  date and place of death unknown mary morrison date of birth unknown date and place of death unknown thomas c morrison born july   died december   in hardin county kentucky caroline j morrison born about  died after  probably in kentucky william c morrison born about  died after  probably in kentucky although isaac morrison was old enough to have performed military service during the war of  none of the official rosters of soldiers from kentucky for that conflict include his name our next public record of isaac morrison is the  federal census for hardin county kentucky which shows he and his wife with two male children less than ten years of age samuel and worden there are also three female children less than ten years of age in the household margaret presumably and two others who cannot be accounted for the families of john morrison jesse morrison and joel a morrison are listed on the same census page in close proximity thanks to jesse morrisons will which was dated  and filed for record in hardin county we know that he was isaac morrisons brother and that joel a morrison was jesses son and therefore isaacs nephew jesse morrison was married to rebecca or becky van meter in  later census records reveal that john morrison was born in north carolina consequently it seems unlikely that he was kin to any of the members of our line which originated in new jersey in  the federal census for hardin county kentucky shows isaac morrison and his wife with two sons less than fiveyearsold thomas and william one son from  to  years of age worden and one son from  to  years of age samuel three of the daughters were from  to  years of age malvina letitia and caroline there were also two young females from  to  years of age lucretia and mary and one female from  to  years of age margaret also known as peggy on january   isaac morrisons oldest son twentyoneyearold samuel was married in hardin county kentucky to sarah sally gilliland age twentythree later that same year on october  isaacs twentyyearold daughter margaret or peggy was married in hardin county to elijah willyard on may   isaac morrisons daughter lucretia age twentyone was married to john c arnold in hardin county kentucky in the  federal census for hardin county kentucky isaac morrison and his wife are shown with two sons aged  to  years two sons aged  to  years three daughters from  to  years of age and two daughters between the ages of  and  unfortunately these numbers do not exactly match what we know about this family in  isaac should have had only one son aged  to  living at home namely worden because by this time samuel was married and living with his wife and children in a separate homestead perhaps the census taker or the person who provided the information simply made an error then there is the problem of too many daughters by  two daughters lucretia and margaret were married and living with their husbands in separate households that leaves only four daughters at home but the census taker put down five furthermore the daughters ages do not entirely match what we know about this family from other sources there are only two possible answers to this dilemma either there is a mistake in the census data or isaac morrison had more children than we know about on march   isaacs daughter mary married abraham van meter spelled vanmetre in the county records in hardin county kentucky that same year on october  isaacs twentytwoyearold son thomas c morrison was also married in hardin county kentucky his bride was twentyyearold lucinda woodring thankfully the  census lists all household members by name in that year the federal census taker found isaac morrison and his wife shown as elizabeth instead of her nickname betsy still living in hardin county kentucky and with five grown children still at home worden p age  malvina c age  letitia y age  caroline j age  and william c age  thanks to this particular census we also know that sixtyfouryearold isaac was born in new jersey while all the other members of the household including his wife were born in kentucky the census tells us further that he was a farmer with a thousand dollars worth of real estate although kentucky was a slave state isaacs name is not among those county residents who were listed in a separate slave schedule on december   isaacs daughter caroline married squire ash in hardin county kentucky on march   twentyyearold malvina c morrison married thomas m yates in hardin county kentucky on january   letitia y morrison married stephen eliot in hardin county kentucky following isaac morrisons death on  june  at the age of seventyfive he was buried in the franklin cross roads cemetery his will dated  july  was filed for record in the hardin county courthouse at elizabethtown kentucky on  august  it names isaacs wife betsy morrison as his principal heir giving her full title to the family farm and all property thereon including all livestock and farming and household items and utensils as well as any money he might have accumulated in the event his widow were to remarry and there seems to be no evidence that she ever did so isaac directed that betsy sell the property taking one third of the proceeds for herself and dividing the remaining two thirds among his children namely son samuel h morrison daughter polly willyard daughter mary van meter daughter lucretia arnold daughter malvina yates son worden p morrison daughter letitia eliot daughter caroline ash son william c morrison and son thomas c morrison the will also names a granddaughter marrietta arnold obviously lucretias daughter who was then living with isaac and betsy finally isaac named his son william c morrison as executor of his estate isaacs nephew joel a morrison and soninlaw john c arnold witnessed the document six years after isaac morrisons death his wife betsey who reportedly passed away in pike county illinois on  september  was buried in franklin crossroads cemetery beside him both graves are marked with upright tombstones although isaacs has broken and therefore sits at an angle abt aft  samuel haycraft morrison born about  in hardin county kentucky was the oldest child of isaac morrison and his wife elizabeth or betsy haycraft morrison samuel was obviously named for his maternal grandfather samuel haycraft sr one of the earliest and most respected residents of hardin county this map of hardin county is part of a larger map of kentucky published in  courtesy library of congress samuel h morrison had at least nine siblings who are named in the preceding section he grew up in all likelihood in a log cabin on a frontier farm where he was almost certainly exposed at an early age to all the pleasures and hardships that such a lifestyle entails on january   at the age of twentyone samuel was married in hardin county kentucky to twentythreeyearold sally gilliland daughter of james gilliland thanks to federal census records for  and  we know that they had the following named children mary e morrison born about  date and place of death unknown charles w morrison born about  died after  place unknown isaac fisher morrison born september   died january   at grant choctaw county oklahoma david g morrison born about  died after  place unknown in  samuel h morrison was enumerated in the federal census for hardin county kentucky on the very same page as his father isaac morrison his brotherinlaw abraham van meter and two of my other hardin county ancestors amos richardson and isaac e richardson see richardson family for this reason we may reasonably assume that samuels first four children mary charles isaac and david were all born in hardin county around  samuels wife sally died of some unknown cause very likely complications of childbirth she was about thirtyoneyearsold her place of burial has been lost to posterity on january   on what would have been his and sallys ninth wedding anniversary samuel married her sister polly whose actual name may have been mary owing to the fact that in those days polly was a common nickname for women named mary relying again on the federal census for  and  we know that samuel and polly had the following children sarah c morrison born about  died after  place unknown george m morrison born about  died after  place unknown alexander r morrison born about  died after  place unknown william l morrison born about  died after  place unknown malcolm a morrison born about  died before  place unknown margaret j morrison born about  died after  place unknown john m morrison born about  died after  place unknown james d morrison born about  died after  place unknown latitia a e morrison born about  died after  place unknown luther w morrison born about  died after  place unknown laura ann morrison born about  died after  place unknown judging by their approximate years of birth it appears that william l and malcolm a morrison were twins but we have no evidence to confirm it in  samuel h morrison was enumerated in the federal census for edmondson county kentucky brownsville the county seat is located about  miles south of elizabethtown the seat of hardin county for this reason we cannot be sure if the last five children were born in hardin or edmonson county it should be mentioned here that according to a letter sent by mrs ruby bryan of raymond mississippi to my aunt inez jenkins hickman in june  samuel h morrison and his wife ada ann were not only married in bowling green warren county kentucky but also that their children were born there she claimed that this information came from a morrison family bible although some of the information mrs bryan supplied my aunt was probably correct such as dates of birth death and marriage i have no doubt whatsoever that she was completely mistaken about any members of the morrison family being married or born in bowling green because that information simply does not match the public records of both hardin county kentucky and the united states government this makes me wonder whether the bible mentioned by mrs bryan was contemporary to the time of the events it is supposed to record or if the information was placed in a later bible and based on someones apparently faulty memory samuels wife and nine of his children are also listed in the  federal census and his occupation is given as clergyman although the sect or denomination is not indicated this census records further that he owned real estate valued at  like his father isaac samuel h morrison was not a slave owner in the  federal census for edmonson county samuel is listed as a farmer with  worth of real estate and  worth of personal property his wife polly and fourteen of his fifteen children are also listed only malcolm a morrison who must have died sometime between  and  is not named in this census although kentucky never seceded from the union during the civil war its residents were almost evenly divided in their loyalty with some supporting the federal government and others the rebel confederacy although we do not know what sort of sentiments were harbored by samuel h morrison we do know that in may  two of his sons isaac and david enlisted in company a first regiment capital guards frankfort battaliona union organization that successfully repelled a confederate attack against the kentucky capital in june  the two young men remained in uniform until january  at which time they were discharged along with the rest of their company from all appearances both samuel h morrison and his wife polly died sometime between  and  because in the  federal census for edmonson county kentucky nine of samuels children are listed in the household of a thirtynineyearold farmer identified only as m morrison whose relationship to these children is not indicated it is also unclear whether an eightyearold thomas n morrison who is shown in this census as a member of the household of m morrison and his twentyfiveyearold wife sarah c morrison is the couples son or if the boy is one of samuel and pollys children isaac f morrison and his brother david g morrison who by this time were both married with families of their own are listed on the very same page obviously living in close proximity to their younger siblings isaac fisher morrison  isaac fisher morrison was born on september   in hardin county kentucky he was the third child and second oldest son of samuel haycraft morrison and his wife sally gilliland morrison following the birth of his brother david in  isaacs mother died probably from complications of childbirth on january   his father samuel married his aunt polly gilliland who thus became his stepmother as well she and samuel had eleven children together who were technically not only samuels halfsiblings but also his halfcousins although kentucky was one of four slave states that officially remained in the union during the civil war the others were missouri delaware and maryland its citizens were almost evenly divided between those who remained loyal to the united states and those who sided with the rebels from all appearances the morrison family remained uncommitted until may   when governor thomas e bramlette roused to desperation by guerrilla outrages issued this proclamation kentuckians to the rescue i want  sixmonths troops at once do not hesitate to come i will lead you let us help to finish the war the and save our government on may  isaac f morrison and his brother david heeded the governors call enlisting as privates in company a first regiment capital guards frankfort battalion although they were not formally mustered into service until june   this company took part in the defense of the city when confederate forces led by general morgan besieged the kentucky capital on june   and   for the remainder of their approximately eightmonths term of service which concluded on january   the frankfort battalion protected the capital from the frequent incursions of guerrilla forces following the end of the civil war the twentysixyearold union veteran was married to mrs ada ann woodring the eighteenyearold widow of addison woodring who was only twentyfive years of age when he died on october   after two years of marriage family lore holds that ada ann and her first husband had two children whose names were lonnie and latisha but only the girl can be accounted for in federal census records where she is listed as latisha morrison not woodring isaac f morrison and ada ann her name is given as ady ann in hardin county records were married at the home of the brides father isaac e richardson on february   thanks to mrs ruby bryan of raymond mississippi one of isaac and ada ann morrisons granddaughters and the federal census of  and  which provides some verification we know that this couple had the following children samuel loranzo morrison born november   in kentucky david andrew morrison born november   in kentucky lilly bell morrison born june   in kentucky isaac bishop morrison born may   in kentucky emmerine j morrison born july   in kentucky sarah janey morrison born september   in kentucky dyer leonard morrison born january   in kentucky millard fillmore morrison born may   in kentucky alice berthy morrison born october   in kentucky william lester or lester william morrison born february   in kentucky ambrose bremnlet or bramlette perhaps he was named after the wartime governor of kentucky thomas e bramlette morrison born march   in lamar county texas arthur neil morrison born october   in lamar county texas died february   in jackson mississippi mrs bryans father charlie morrison born and died may   in lamar county texas a later federal censusthe one of asked women how many children they had borne and how many of those were still living to that question ada ann answered fifteen and twelve respectively one of the three deceased children of course was charles another was probably the aforementioned lonnie woodring but who was the third one i believe it was probably samuel loranzo morrison for the simple reason that i have been unable to find any information about him after  this family is listed in both the  and  federal census for edmonson county kentucky which was obviously the birthplace of the first ten children named above the final three as indicated were born in texas each census identifies isaac f morrison as a farmer although most of the  federal census was destroyed by fire an enumeration of all living union veterans was taken that same year thankfully this special census schedule has survived to the present day and isaac f morrison is listed in it as living in lamar county texas which further confirms his departure from kentucky in the s there is no information about the veterans family this census simply verifies that isaac served in company a first regiment of capital guards he told the census taker he served nine months instead of eight which may have simply been an honest mistake it also tells us that he was deaf in his left ear and hard of hearing in the right in addition to telling us how many children ada ann morrison bore the  federal census provides evidence that sometime between the birth of lester in february  and the birth of ambrose in march  the family of isaac f and ada ann morrison journeyed from kentucky to texas where they settled in lamar countya little more than a hundred miles northeast of dallas and just across the red river from indian territory we do not know however whether they made the journey by train which they could have done by that time or by covered wagon what led them to leave kentucky and to settle in that spot in texas is likewise anyones guess this late nineteenth century map of north texas shows lamar county and the surrounding area courtesy library of congress although i have never taken the time to search for deed records concerning the morrison family in the lamar county courthouse an oversight i hope to correct in the near future i do know that they settled near a community called powderly located a little more than ten miles almost directly north of paris the county seat and that their farm was probably situated within the bounds of presentday camp maxey a large federal military installation established in  which is now a national guard training facility in  my aunt inez jenkins hickman and i visited camp maxey which is located on the west side of state highway  near powderly to look for casey cemetery where ada ann morrison is supposed to be buried i am happy to report that we found the cemetery which was in a remote location and very overgrown but could not find a grave marker for ada ann during our search we almost certainly passed through or very near the spot where the morrison family farm existed from  until just before world war one the family of thomas w jenkins a georgiaborn farmer also lived in this area not surprisingly the younger members of the two families socialized with one another and in time three marriages resulted the first of these matrimonial partnerships was between david andrew morrison and delilah emma jenkins which occurred on february   the second was the marriage of my greatgrandfather william newton jenkins to emmerine morrison on july   the third was the marriage of isaac b morrison to lizzie jenkins it is interesting to note that as a result of the first two marriages emma jenkins became emma morrison and emmerine morrison or emma as she was also sometimes called became emma jenkins of course there were other morrison weddings in lamar county texas besides those discussed in the preceding paragraphs on december   lillie bell morrison married w s luckey on july   sarah jane morrison married w r killingsworth and on january  arthur neil morrison married della gunter a photograph i inherited from my aunt nez after she passed away in  shows eleven members of the morrison and jenkins families as they appeared around the turn of the twentieth century it was taken outofdoors on the morrison farm with the familys twostory frame house and outbuildings apparently unpainted clearly visible in the background this photo is reproduced below standing in a row from left to right are either lester or ambrose morrison mattie jenkins may jenkins isaac benton morrison his wife lizzie jenkins morrison and emmerine morrison the identity of the boy standing at the very end of the row is uncertain seated from left to right are isaac fisher morrison lena morrison emmerines illegitimate daughter major sam killingsworth janey morrison killingsworths eldest son and isaacs wife ada ann isaac f and ada ann morrison were still living in lamar county when the federal census for  was taken but only lena was living with them some of their married children however were still living nearby apparently on adjacent farms and perhaps on land that was either given or sold to them by their parents in  isaac f morrison applied for a federal pension based on his civil war service presumably it was granted i also need to send for copies of this file which is held by the national archives in washington dc sometime after the  census was taken it appears that isaac f morrison and his wife separated with isaac going to live in grant oklahoma with one of his younger sons either ambrose or lester and ada going to live with either david or millard in lamar county texas on january   isaac f morrison died at grant oklahoma and was buried in a cemetery probably grant cemetery located about  miles northeast of the city ada ann morrison died on may   and was buried at casey cemetery near powderly lamar county texas her grave is apparently unmarked or the stone has fallen down and been covered with earth so that it cannot be seen only some of the graves in casey cemetery near powderly texas have tombstones no marker has been found for ada ann morrison author photo emmerine j morrison  emmerine morrison also called emma was born july   in kentucky probably edmonson county she was the fifth child and second oldest daughter of isaac f morrison and his wife ada ann richardson woodring morrison unfortunately very little is known about emmerines early years all we can be sure of is that she came to live in lamar county texas with her parents and siblings about  when she was eleven years old and that she grew up on a farm near the small rural community of powderly texas in  when emmerine was twenty she gave birth to an illegitimate child who is has been said was the product of incest between emma and her own father isaac an allegation for which there is no apparent evidence but also no reason to disbelieve in any case the child a girl who was named lena may was born deaf and with a limited ability therefore to speak intelligibly a disability from which she apparently suffered throughout her relatively long life on july   twentysixyearold emmerine was married in lamar county texas to william newton jenkins the nineteenyearold son of a neighboring farm family fn afterward they lived at hinckleya small community located on a railway line about four miles north of paris texas together they had the following children lillie pearl jenkins born june   died april   at dallas dallas county texas william ollie jenkins born june   died october   at chicago cook county illinois isaac newton jenkins born november   died september   place unknown the marriage of my greatgrandparents william n jenkins and emmerine morrison was exceptional for two reasons first because at the time of their wedding emmerine already had a fouryearold daughter named lena may who would today be called hearing and speech impaired or in the parlance of the time deaf and dumb lena was also illegitimate or bornoutofwedlock as it was termed in those days secondly emmerine was seven years older than william which was particularly unusual at a time in history when women were generally much younger than their husbands at the time of their wedding in the summer of  emmerine was twentysix and william only nineteen ordinarily it would have been the other way around on march   less than four months after her son isaac newton was born emmerine morrison died at her home in hinckley of septicemia blood poisoning a condition that may or may not have been connected with her recent childbirth she was only thirty years old emmerine was buried in faubion cemetery located about one mile northeast of paris texas where her grave is apparently unmarked only a few graves in faubion cemetery in paris texas have tombstones no marker has been found for emmerine morrison author photo notes a van doren honeyman

sheet a  to be added  list prepared by robert miles morrison of coleman texas dated may   and sent to inez jenkins hickman of dallas texas u s dept of commerce bureau of the census fourteenth census of the united states  population lamar county texas supervisors district  enumeration district  family  sheet b  cemetery list prepared by robert miles morrison of coleman texas dated may   and sent to inez jenkins hickman of dallas texas  to be added  i remember emmerines daughter lena from my childhood when she sometimes traveled from her home in raymond mississippi to visit my grandaunt pearl lenas halfsister and pearls husband earnest hayes who lived in east dallas lena was certainly deaf but she was not actually dumb because i often heard her trying to speak but the sounds that came out of her mouth were largely unintelligible and to a young child like me a little disconcertingalthough i had no real reason to be afraid lena was a small fraillooking woman who probably wouldnt have harmed a fly when i first began my maternal family history research in  i assumed that lena was my greatgrandfathers child and that he eventually married her mother as they said in those days to make an honest woman of her however after i learned from census records that lena was identified as his stepdaughter i began to wonder if her disability might be the result of incest shortly before he passed away in  my uncle jack jenkins confirmed my suspicion telling me in a telephone conversation and by the way without my asking that lena was the result of intimate relations between emmerine and her own father unfortunately i failed to ask how he came to know this this begs the question is it true perhaps certainly my uncle believed so and of course it might also account for lenas disability as i had wondered all along unfortunately it tends to cast my greatgreatgrandfather morrison in a bad light which troubles me i hate to think that any of my ancestors were capable of such bad acts what i find astonishing is that if this tale is true and also if the other members of the family knew about it they seem to have accepted the situation with a remarkable degree of grace and discretion from all appearances neither his wife nor children ostracized my greatgreatgrandfather morrison in any way nor does it appear that emmerine and her daughter were ever treated as outcasts the fact that my greatgrandfather jenkins was willing to marry this young woman in spite of her exceptional situation also speaks volumes about the affection that he must have had for her  to be added  to be added
