company as president and secretary fred luke rejoins management team of green automotive company as president and secretary mr luke to fill vacancy created by resignation of carter read aug    et from green automotive company riverside calif aug   prnewswire  green automotive company otcgacr announced today that fred g luke has agreed to rejoin the company as its president and secretary ben rainwater the companys ceo commenting on fred lukes return to management said fred served as the companys president during  and was the driving force behind the companys initial restructuring recapitalization and taking it from a nonreporting shell company to a fully reporting nonshell company during freds two year tenure ben rainwater went on say the companys market capitalization rose to approximately  million  he further successfully renegotiated the contract with the original chinese maker of the allelectric sport utility vehicle and took it through the us regulatory testing before determining that the electric car sector was becoming too competitive and shifted the companys focus to allelectric cng and conventionalfueled shuttle buses and municipal and school bus conversions mr luke stated that my original objective was to get the allelectric sport utility vehicle approved for consumer sales in the us while restructuring the company to qualify for listing on the otc markets otcqb tier which i accomplished in december of   however the allelectric suv did not pass the federal motor vehicle safety standards tests forcing us to change direction and focus the companys resources on the bus market which at the time appeared to me to be wideopen following the decision to change direction the company acquired liberty electric cars ltd a ukbased company which represented to have successfully converted range rovers into allwheel drive allelectric vehicles mr luke also acquired a newly formed company newport coachworks inc and hired mr carter read to begin building and converting buses starting with shuttle buses shortly after the acquisition of newport coachworks inc mr luke resigned from management but remained as a member of the board of directors recent events said ceo ben rainwater including a dispute with the landlord of newport coachworks wilson street manufacturing facility resulting in newport coachworks allegedly receiving a notice to quit or pay and then being locked out of the facility together with the recent resignation of mr carter read from his positions with green automotive company and newport coachworks have led the company to turn back to mr luke to assist with these issues and others facing the companies currently we are attempting to determine from mr read and the landlord at the wilson street facility exactly what has happened with newport coachworks and its assets and determine the exact nature of the relationship if any between those parties  however so far no litigation has been filed by any of the parties  fred has over  years in cleaning up problems like the ones newport coachworks is facing now said mr rainwater as he did in  i expect him to get to the bottom of the problems with newport coachworks quickly  take swift and appropriate action  and begin to rebuild as he has done in the past he has already  retained counsel to investigate the current status of the wilson street manufacturing facility and the circumstances and events leading up to mr reads resignation and the involvement if any of any other third party companies as to the recent message board comments and other rumors being circulated said mr luke i would recommend that everyone refrain from putting too much value in the message board reports until my investigation of the activities and actions of mr read and others has been completed which i expect to conclude in the near future we have already made contact with certain third parties that may be involved as well as legal counsel for the landlord and we expect to  file our form k relating to mr reads resignation and other management changes by today  we will have further announcements as the requested documentation is produced and the facts
