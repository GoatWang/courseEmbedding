state of delaware v joseph a shields jr defendant superior court of delaware new castle county submitted november   decided november   kathleen jennings and jeffrey m taschner deputy attys gen dept of justice wilmington del for the state nancy jane perillo asst public defender wilmington del for defendant opinion barron judge the court at defense counsels request conducted a competency hearing which commenced on september   and ended on october   to determine the competency of joseph a shields jr to stand trial on two counts of murder in the first degree one count of unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree and one count of unlawful sexual intercourse in the first degree additionally oral argument  was had before the court on october   and on november   the court conducted an interview with the defendant the case is now ready for decision background the defendant joseph a shields jr is a  year old young man who is slight of build with an appearance of one younger than his years on or about april   he allegedly raped and murdered a seven year old female brenda coxe almost immediately following the defendants arrest on april   defense counsel apparently questioned her clients competency and sanity for within days of the arrest stephen mechanick md a psychiatrist and irwin weintraub phd a clinical psychologist both hired by the defense had each conducted their first interviews of the defendant at gander hill prison but as the evidence adduced at the competency hearing made clear the defendants involvement with psychiatricpsychological evaluation and treatment commenced years earlier when the defendant was a child a review of that history as presented by defense counsel in the course of the competency hearing is in order so as to capture as complete a portrait as possible of this troubled and disturbed young man in september  when the defendant was  years old he was referred by his school psychologist to the child diagnostic and development clinic cddc of the alfred i dupont institute for an evaluation a year earlier in  the school psychologist william shaw evaluated the defendant and found him to be functioning in the borderline range at age  he had been enrolled in the developmental preschool program within the claymont school district thereafter he attended the diagnostic prescriptive training center in the same district the cddc psychological report dated september   indicated that his current intellectual performance was measured and found to be as follows full scale score of  in the borderline average range verbal score of  in the mildly retarded range and performance score of  in the lowaverage range the reports summary stated in pertinent part as follows  joey is seen as a young man of uneven intellectual development who has a serious language disorder his language functioning is in the mildly retarded range of functioning this is primarily manifested in his difficulty in taking in auditory information from the world and in processing and organizing this material in a coherent way for verbal expression when the defendant was ½ years of age on october   he was admitted to the terry childrens psychiatric center tcpc inpatient program for what was expected to be an extended day evaluation he was referred by his mother rosemarie shields who related that the defendant had recent incidents of firesetting burning papers in his apartment complex setting his bed and his grandmothers rug on fire lying and stealing a psychological examination was performed on january  and january   while at the tcpc this time the defendant achieved a verbal score of  a performance score of  and a full scale score of  chief psychologist george frangia noted in his report that the test scores seem to indicate that joey is a learning disabled boy who would have special difficulty in the area of reading there is a possibility of diffusive brain damage which would affect his scholastic ability while he is distractable he is able to concentrate at times his thought processes seem rather concrete and may tend to fragment when he is placed under pressure  a psychological evaluation performed on october   reflected an apparent regression evaluation results indicate joey to be a very insecure boy with underlying emotional pathology of a quite serious nature his ability to perceive reality accurately is significantly impaired and there is evidence of cognitive slippage taken together these facts suggest the presence of an underlying or developing thought disorder in his summary staff child psychologist thomas j hebeisen phd opined that the defendants inner resources are quite limited and his capacity to accurately understand and effectively deal with his environment is highly impaired later on july   when the defendant was  years of age dr hebeisen noted that joey has exhibited a significantly improved adjustment since his last psychological evaluation  in particular there has been a notable decrease in retreat into fantasy and a generally improved and more stable reality orientation in class he has been able to remain more taskoriented and does not typically present any behavioral difficulties however despite these gains it is clear that joey remains a seriously disturbed youngster who will require continued specialized services after his discharge at the end of this summer on july   speech pathologist kamala prasad also had found improvement in the area of speech and language on november   she had found the defendant to be a ½ year old boy with a central language problem major areas of weakness are  auditory memory  temporal concepts  abstract thinking  grammar and  auditory discrimination in july of  however she stated that joey has improved considerably in his ability to attend listen to verbally presented material answer questions about the main idea as well as details and recall the information several days later he is very motivated to acquire new information and can listen semiindependently to audiocassettes for  minutes on topics of general interest his case manager child psychiatrist anita l amurao md noted in her treatment plan review no  dated may   that joey showed consistent improvements in ego functioning and was transferred to full day hospital on  though he did not show any evident behavioral regression his individual sessions during this period reflected increasing pressures to grow up and deal with reality there has been an increase in tall tales for the past six weeks and his fantasies often start with a reality issue we are pleased with his progress and there are no changes in the treatment plans except for his medication we plan to increase the dosage of mellaril to determine if he can reach a higher level of functioning on august   the defendant was discharged from the tcpc as improved at the time of his discharge he was functioning at a firstgrade level in reading spelling and math his ability to  concentrate on his assignments was poor frequently daydreaming or being distracted by outside stimuli while having a very low frustration level he was usually cooperative pleasant and cheerful interacting well with his peers the recommended release plan called for the defendant to attend springer intensive learning center in september  with delaware guidance continuing with outpatient treatment testifying with regard to the defendants involvement with the tcpc were inez hanson a psychiatric social worker charles sample a social worker dr thomas hebeisen a clinical psychologist and dr anita amurao a child psychiatrist dr hebeisen placed the defendants full scale intelligence quadrant within the mild range of mental retardation dr amuraos final diagnosis at discharge was child schizoid disorder mixed developmental learning disorder and borderline personality disorder she felt that the defendant would show regression in ego functioning under stress at the time of his discharge from tcpc the defendant was  years old by age  the defendant was again being evaluated because of management problems the evaluation was conducted by leighton jones md of the delaware guidance services for children and youth inc and took place on july   dr jones noted the defendant to have an extremely short attention span he further noted that the defendant was quite impulsive and distractible and had a very rich fantasy life it was noted that the mellaril had been discontinued following the defendants release from the tcpc dr jones impression was that joseph is a boy with longstanding neurological problems which include both learning disability and attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity dr jones performed a second psychiatric examination on december   he noted that at the end of october  the defendant had attempted to set fire to himself following an incident of teasing by peers at school dr jones noted that upon interviewing the defendant he appeared to be a very cooperative boy who was oriented in all spheres there was some question of his reality testing the defendant spoke of being angry and when he is angry he admitted that he wanders off sometimes not knowing where he is going dr jones recommended that the defendant was in need of a setting which provides a maximum amount of structure and supervision where his tendency to wander could be monitored and controlled the defendant was treated off and on at delaware guidance services from june   until december   his discharge diagnosis was adjustment disorder with anxious mood and mixed specific developmental disorder kenneth johnson a social worker and leighton w jones md testified for the defendant at the competency hearing mr johnson testified that both he and dr jones had concluded during their period of treatment that outpatient therapy would do no good for the defendant who they felt needed an inpatient facility on january   the defendant was admitted to the rockford center where he remained until may   he was admitted for bizarre behavior which included wandering behavior having a poor sense of time short attention span and poor concentration skills he was known to be a liar and was unable to get along with his peers he often engaged in selfdestructive behavior in the january   social assessment a social worker noted the present problems the informant depicts the patient as displaying wandering behavior and having a very poor sense of time and is  described as having a short attention span and poor concentration skills at times he cannot remember information that he learned the prior day he often seeks attention from others by distorting the truth with exaggeration resorting to a fantasy world and mimicking animals he associates with children much younger than he and feels pressured by peers his age joey often has lack of selfconfidence and a poor selfesteem he is described as a very immature and emotional child who cries easily during the admission procedure at rockford center joey talked about an imaginary friend wolfer joey tends to be truant from school and runs around hiding in apartments during the fall the informant described joey as taking a knife to his stomach and threatening to kill himself and on halloween night he was found attempting to burn himself with matches during another occasion while he was visiting his father in new jersey joey was walking their dog peaches he was found by the police on an industrial site where the dog had ended up in the pit and died the informant is unsure whether or not joey intentionally threw his dog in the pit or if the dog had accidently fallen into the pit mr merrell a division of child protective services social worker collaborated with delaware child guidance and they contacted dr garbayo who psychiatrically evaluated joey and suggested that he be hospitalized at the rockford center as a result joey became a patient at the rockford center under the treatment of dr garbayo the rockford center discharge summary dated may   summarized the defendants clinical course patient was admitted to the adolescent treatment center at the time he was diagnosed as an undersocialized conduct disorder aggressive he was seen in consultation by dr graff who noted his bizarre behavior which alienated him from his peers dr graff also noted a history of self destructive behavior and lashing out dr graff noted learning disability the question of childhood schizophrenia was raised he was transferred to dr graffs service he was treated for a long period of time on the adolescent unit it was noted that he had extremely poor self esteem and was quite annoying to staff and to peers he engaged in self destructive behavior goals of the therapy were to help him end his self destructive behavior recognize his behavior patterns and to increase self esteem one important issue was that he was called joey after discussion with patient and the floor we were able to drop the childlike nickname and to give him a more ageappropriate name joe therapy was supportive in terms of helping him develop his self esteem he worked hard to achieve the proper number of points but seemed unable to achieve that over a period of time it became clear that further placement would be necessary and referral to devereaux school was made workup continued up to the time of discharge on june   the defendant was readmitted to the rockford center he remained until discharged on july   at discharge he had a principal diagnosis of attention deficit disorder with other diagnoses of narcissistic personality disorder and undersocialized aggressive disorder the chief complaint was noted as follows the patient killed the family cat in a fit of rage  under the heading family and past history the july   discharge summary notes after his first discharge from the rockford center he had gone to live with his mother maternal grandfather and his mothers boyfriend he visited his father on weekends two incidents caused the patient to live with his father his grandfather died and the second is that there were physical abuse threats to the patient by a neighbor who accused the patient of harming his small daughter following that he moved in with his father and his fathers girlfriend the family had hoped that the patient would learn to control himself while a patient at the rockford center with regard to his mental status the july   discharge summary noted at the time of admission the patient was casual cooperative with a spontaneous manner his motor activity was increased his care functions were ambulatory his speech was coherent and the content was relevant productivity was spontaneous his mood was normal and consistent common sense however was poor and chief complaint

his behavior in the hospital he only manifested one period of difficulty acting out an aggressiveness harold graff md a psychiatrist with the rockford center and frederick kozma phd a psychologist who in  was with youth diagnostic center testified for the defendant with regard to the defendants rockford center treatment dr graff testified that he sees joey as very disturbed yet admitted in crossexamination that he had not seen the defendant since  he admitted that during the defendants first stay at the rockford center there was nothing indicated to him that the defendant was mentally retarded nor was there evidence of hallucinations or delusions he saw no signs of childhood schizophrenia dr graff felt that structure was very important for the defendants achievement the doctor also stated that he and the defendant were able to communicate dr kozma evaluated the defendant on may   prior to his first discharge from the rockford center he found the defendant to be basically cooperative and that the defendant was interested in relating to him the defendant participated freely but as time went on he became fatigued after about one hour he diagnosed the defendant with having attention deficit disorder residual type developmental reading disorder and developmental arithmetic disorder he testified that his diagnoses were consistent with prior evaluations he felt that the defendant had satisfactory reality contact an adequate ability to assess his environment and was functioning reasonably well in the absence of stress dr kozma recommended a school program designed to aid learning disabled children and a consistent program of behavioral management both at home and at school both parents of the defendant testified at the hearing the defendants parents separated in july  and were later divorced the father joseph shields sr testified that since the defendants stay at tcpc he has had a very short attention span he pointed out that his son has real difficulty concentrating retaining information and following directions he stated that the defendant cannot read a newspaper or even a first grade primer and that he cannot read the face dial of a clock  the defendants father stated that even at age  the defendant played with  or  year olds rather than his peers mr shields was of the opinion that his son could not understand the charges or proceedings against him nor did he see how the defendant could assist his counsel he felt that his son could not understand or remember testimony the defendants mother rosemarie shields recounted her sonss development problems and his earlier admissions to treatment facilities she stated that he doesnt comprehend long sentences she noted that it takes him  minutes to write down a telephone number mrs shields also believes that her son could not assist counsel or understand the legal procedures concerning his case john brower mrs shields boyfriend testified that prior to the defendants incarceration both he and the defendant worked at a philadelphia branch of thriftway he as a meatcutter the defendant as a helper he stated that the defendant was only given menial jobs because he was so slow mr brower stated that he had to sometimes repeat instructions and even physically demonstrate in order for the defendant to understand directions he described the defendant as a pretty good employee who could be interested in an assignment for awhile but that he couldnt seem to stay in one place other background witnesses included jane madding an educational diagnostician with the springer intensive learning center sherry goff coordinator child study team with the clayton public schools of clayton new jersey arlene koeferl of the clinical services division of the department of services to children youth and their families formerly called the youth diagnostic center and sandra mckinley an acquaintance of the shields family who coached the defendant in roller skating when the defendant was  and  years of age she noted that the defendant had good coordination but that he could not remember the skating routines that she tried to teach him also the defendants school records were introduced in evidence there is no need to recount at any great length all of this testimony and evidence suffice it to say that the portrait of the defendant as a learning disabled young man with significant perceptual deficits remained rather constant in june  the defendant graduated from the clayton public schools where he had been enrolled in a special course at abilities center of southern new jersey inc since september  james moore rehabilitation counselor with the abilities center noted in his end of year report  to  that according to the defendants supervisor for the period january through march  the most dramatic improvements in josephs performance were in the areas of initiative attitude and concentration the same report noted that in april and may  the defendant worked in the food service training area and that since his transfer into the food service area his attendance and desire to earn his high school diploma has increased dramatically mr moore recommended that the defendant be awarded his high school diploma for clayton public schools with placement in competitive employment immediately thereafter he also recommended that consideration be given to lifting the defendants probationary status with this state in july of  because of his academic and vocational progress at the abilities center the probationary status mentioned by mr moore in his may   report referred to a  year period of probation imposed by delaware family court judge john t gallagher on july   on that date the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of reckless burning in violation of  delc §  the defendant had been represented by counsel both parents were present for this family court proceeding  wherein judge gallagher found as follows respondent advised the court that he understood and accepted the plea agreement that he understood the possibility of incarceration that according to his perception he has been fully advised by counsel on the premises and that he knew that the court was not bound by the agreement or its recommendation he was prepared to enter a plea of guilty to one of the two charges of reckless burning before accepting the guilty plea i interrogated respondent with respect to the questions required by brown v state and after considering the totality of the circumstances i am satisfied that the guilty plea has been knowingly and intelligently made and the record shows and the court finds that respondent is in fact guilty of the offense to which he pled guilty thereupon the guilty plea was accepted by the court i listened to the comments of counsel and those of mr shields apparently mrs shields has been deeply into this matter and has helped arrange for respondents acceptance into the abilities center program respondent is also to attend the first starter course conducted by the state fire marshall these are serious charges which could have resulted in serious threat to life and property while mr moore noted the defendants dramatic improvement in the end of year report  to  and while a delaware family court judge found the defendant to have knowingly and intelligently entered a plea of guilty to reckless burning in july  the defendants impairments could not be seriously doubted during this period of his life on november   dr john a visceglia tested the defendants intelligence using the wechsler adult intelligence scale as the testing instrument on this occasion the defendant scored a  on verbal an  on performance and full scale of  dr visceglia noted that the defendant continued to score at borderline levels intellectually with considerable deficit in all verbal areas he also noted significant perceptual deficits in a december   evaluation sherry goff the learning disabilities consultant found the defendant to be functioning at the preprimer level in reading at the first grade level in spelling and at the second grade level in math she also noted that the defendant had severe perceptual and language deficits which appear to be negatively impacting upon his academic progress stephen mechanick md a licensed pennsylvania psychiatrist testified for the defense pursuant to defense counsels request he saw the defendant for psychiatric evaluation on april   prior to this evaluation dr mechanick reviewed the search warrant affidavit of probable cause the indictment the brandywine school district records as well as records from the abilities center of southern new jersey the tcpc and the rockford center the evaluation took place at gander hill prison and after being introduced to the defendant by defense counsel lasted for ¼ hours under the heading mental status examination dr mechanick wrote mr shields was an alert white male who appeared his stated age he was dressed in prison uniform and he was wellgroomed his hair was cut very short in the front and long in the back mr shields was pleasant and cooperative throughout the interview his speech was normal in rate and tone his affect was immature and childlike he smiled throughout the interview and appeared slightly anxious he did not appear sad  or angry during the interview he reported his mood as high trying to keep happy nervous reading the bible a lot mr shields thought processes showed circumstantiality and tangentiality there was no loosening of associations mr shields denied ideas of reference or paranoid ideation he said that he believes in ufos and ghosts and that he saw a ghost once when he was in a house in claymont he denied any violent homicidal or suicidal ideation he denied visual auditory olfactory gustatory or tactile hallucinations mr shields was oriented to person place and time he was able to repeat  digits forwards and  digits backwards when asked to recite the presidents

he said transportation when asked how milk and water are similar he said liquid mr shields interpreted every cloud has a silver lining as a time will come something to hope for he interpreted people in glass houses should not throw stones as they are in glass houses they shouldnt throw stones the stones could go somewhere and hurt someone mr shields had difficulty drawing a clock putting the number on the face and drawing the correct time there were some errors in his copying of a threedimensional box when asked to write a quick brown fox he wrote coqi fox bren when asked what he would do if he smelled smoke in a theater he said walk up to the front entrance and yell fire id be the first one out instead of being run over when asked what he would do if he found an envelope on the street that had an address and a stamp on it he said take it straight to the post office they will know what to do with it under the heading understanding of legal process dr mechanick wrote mr shields said that ms perillo is public defender sort of a lawyer when asked to say more he added its a twoway team she talks off in court another lawyer goes through the records they are to help you out in court defend your case mr shields said there are two charges against him one is sexual assault which means like having intercourse with a person penis right in her anaminus sic i asked him to explain this and he said between the legs he did not know why this was wrong when asked whether it is wrong to have intercourse with a child or against someones wishes he said that these were wrong the other charge he identified as murder and said this meant the persons dead he said it is wrong to kill a person mr shields did not know who was charging him with these crimes he said that he would go to court where it would be decided whether he did these things he said that the judge would decide also the jury would decide the jury is a bunch of people sitting in chairs who hear both sides and decide when asked what the person representing the state does he said that this person tries to prove you did it dr mechanick in his may   report concluded as follows it is my opinion based on reasonable medical certainty that mr shields is mentally ill it is my opinion based on reasonable medical certainty that mr shields mental illness does not currently impair him to a degree that he is unable to comprehend the nature of the charges against him it is my opinion based on reasonable medical certainty that mr shields mental illness does not impair him such that he is unable to assist his attorney in the preparation and conduct of his defense  on may   dr mechanick evaluated the defendant for a second time again at gander hill prison the purpose of this interview was to discuss with the defendant the events surrounding the crimes for which he now stands charged with committing and the circumstances surrounding his statements given to the police dr mechanick recorded the results of this interview in his psychiatric evaluation dated june   i asked mr shields to describe what had happened on april   mr shields said that on that day his brother jimmy had asked him for  jimmy had bought parts for a fourwheeler vehicle that the two brothers shared and wanted to be paid back mr shields asked john his mothers boyfriend for the money john became angry with jimmy and yelled at him jimmy yelled at john for not letting joseph do what he wants for instance not letting joseph buy a dirt bike john became angry with jimmy and said that he did not want jimmy around the boys mother then became angry with john and said that it was not his right to kick jimmy out of the house john attempted to hit the boys mother and this angered the boys following this argument mr shields went upstairs to be alone and to cool out his mother later came up and asked him nicely to come downstairs mr shields told her he was going outside his mother told him to come back inside around  oclock which would have given him approximately ten minutes outdoors mr shields did not come in at  oclock because he was still angry while he was outside brenda coxe came up to him and asked where her brother was mr shields told her he did not know where her brother was he then started to walk towards the house of rob a friend of his he walked down a path towards the triple tunnels these are three tunnels through which the creek passes he said that this was the route he was taking to go to robs house mr shields stopped at a rope swing before he got to the triple tunnels he thought he might be able to get his anger out by swinging out over the creek on the rope swing he went on the swing but still could not get his anger out during this time at the rope swing ms coxe talked about how she was going to get her brother in trouble she said that she was going to try to get him grounded mr shields said to her could you please leave and she said no mr shields then walked away very quickly to try to leave her but ms coxe followed he told her to leave two more times the third time he told her to go he was at big ben he said that big ben is a large rock which slopes down into the water of the creek after mr shields told ms coxe for the third time to go he said he couldnt control his anger and blew up mr shields pushed ms coxe away from him and she went into the water he did not remember what he was thinking at the time he pushed her he added that the police have said that ms coxe hit her head when she went into the water mr shields was unable to estimate how long ms coxe was in the water he could not remember if she was moving or still while she was in the water he said that it was dark in the woods at that time mr shields could not remember what he was thinking during this period he did not know during this period whether ms coxe was alive or dead ms coxes body came floating to the surface of the water with her face down in the water after ms coxe came to the surface of the water mr shields stepped into the water and pulled her out he initially used a stick to grab hold of her and pull her towards him he said he would not dive into the water at that time because it was ice cold he  added that if he had not pulled her out she would have floated to the phoenix steel plant and have been sucked into the pipes he said that the pipes contained blades that spin very quickly and that if ms coxe floated into them that would have made phoenix steel uptight after mr shields pulled ms coxe part of the way towards him with the stick he got hold of her with his hands and pulled her out of the water he then hit her once in the stomach with his fist he said that he does not know why he did this and that he was confused at the time mr shields then took a stick and said that he rammed it into ms coxes mouth he does not remember what he was thinking at the time he did that but said that he was feeling a lot of anger he then added most body sensors are in the throat i thought ramming the stick in her mouth would make her throw up water mr shields then walked away he said that his radio which he had brought with him and is the size of a boom box had slid into the water and he went to get it out he put the radio on a spot of land where there was dirt he then picked up another stick and stabbed it into ms coxes crotch area he does not know why he did this but added theres where i was not thinking right he next threw a rock which was approximately a foot in diameter and weighted approximately five pounds at ms coxes head and crushed her head he demonstrated to me a distance of approximately four feet which he believed was the distance he was standing from ms coxe when he threw the rock mr shields did not know why he threw the rock after throwing it he said fuck and walked away he then thought i did something wrong so i might as well go home and tell my mother mr shields walked home from the direction he had come before he got to his house he saw ms coxes brother who asked him if he had seen her mr shields denied having seen her he then went in his house and his mother and brother accused him of having taken someones dirt bike without permission he got angry with them went upstairs and went to sleep without telling them what he had done the next day he got up and went to work as usual he said that he sic day was uneventful and that he did not think about what he had done the previous day following his initial evaluation of april   dr mechanick received from defense counsel other documents concerning the defendant based on this added information including dr irwin weintraubs psychological evaluation as well as his further interviews of the defendant dr mechanick by letter to defense counsel dated september   changed his opinion with regard to the issue of competency he wrote i am writing to advise you of my opinions regarding two issues in the case of joseph shields the first issue is whether mr shields was capable of adequately understanding and waiving his miranda rights on april   and april   the second issue is whether he is mentally competent to stand trial my opinion on these two issues are based on the following data  my psychiatric examinations of mr shields on april  and may    review of documents concerning mr shields and this case  evaluation of an audiotape of his statement to the police on april    discussion with dr irwin weintraub concerning the results of his psychological evaluation of mr shields  discussion with you concerning what is required of mr shields to assist in preparation and conduct of his defense it is my opinion based on reasonable medical certainty and this information that mr shields has both mental illness and mental defect his mental defects include his mild mental retardation developmental arithmetic disorder developmental reading disorder and developmental expressive and receptive language  disorders mr shields mental illnesses include attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder it is my opinion based on reasonable medical certainty and this information that mr shields was not capable of adequately understanding and waiving his miranda rights on april   and april   due to his mental illness and mental defects it is also my opinion at this time based on reasonable medical certainty and this information that mr shields is not capable of understanding the nature of the proceedings against him and he is not able to give evidence in his own defense or instruct counsel on his behalf dr mechanicks september   opinion was strengthened he testified as a result of interviewing the defendant after the september   court session of his understanding of the competency hearing the defendant remarked to dr mechanick that we were here to hear people talk dr irwin weintraub a consulting psychologist and diplomate in clinical psychology interviewed the defendant on april   may   may   july   and july   all interviews occurred at the gander hill prison in his report defendants exhibit  dr weintraub noted that joey knows the charge placed against him the reason for incarceration the general roles of the judge jury prosecuting and defense attorneys his general impression of the defendant from observation of appearance and behavior is that the defendant is of significantly below average reasoning very poor stress tolerance social emotional and behavioral immaturity equivalent to the preadolescent developmental level minimal insight concerning his low functioning adjustmentachievement weak selfimage strong dependency needs and susceptibility to manipulation the results of the wechsler adult intelligence scalerevised administered to the defendant by dr weintraub were as follows verbal iq  defective performance iq  dull normal full scale intelligence  borderline based upon the wechsler adult intelligence scalerevised and other psychologicalintelligence tests including the wide range achievement testrevised the wechsler memory scalerevised bendergestalt with memory housetreeperson rorschach sentence completion test oral and the minnesota multiphasic personality  inventory dr weintraubs analysis was as follows intelligence general functioning ranges from mental defective mild to borderline defective this is consistent with former intelligence test results scholastic achievements in the basic core subjects of reading spelling and arithmetic test at third grade level and substantiate limited ability to learn special education placement was required from the onset of schooling reasoning is potentially sufficient for everyday simple tasks where he is familiar with requirements and is not under felt stress to produce quickly or accurately reasoning is blocked when intellectual andor emotional demands exceed borderline skills so that he cannot organize thoughts solutions and reactions in a rational controlled successful manner language reading and spelling are at third grade level and of no practical application joeys claim that he reads books is an immature effort at impressing and reveals limited awarenessinsight as to how transparent his manipulation oral communication initially superficially appears to be above borderline to defective caliber pursuit of indepth explanation of his ideas reveals a shallow understanding with very little knowledge beyond the obvious under pressure he becomes confused and in a childish manner may offer implausible explanations andor fabricate andor rigidly adhere to his answers despite obvious data to the contrary memory recall of thoughts feelings and events can become easily confused by passage of time andor intellectual complexity andor stressed attention span and concentration when unable to accurately recall he may fabricate in an attempt to hide his lapse andor to please and be accepted by whoever he is communicating with essentially memory is unreliable and can be manipulated by others psychomotor joey is more comfortable and productive with tangible tasks of a simple repetitious manualmechanical nature than those relying on language skills pressure to learn andor produce quickly however causes him to become slower andor less attentive to details for occupational purposes joey requires a structured nondemanding environment with opportunity for close encouragement guidance and support when necessary abilities center school advised job training in routine food service delivery that did not require independent reasoning or planning reality there is no manifestation of delusions or hallucinations although some evidence was detected during prior hospitalizations within his capacity for elementary reasoning and the absence of any emotional duress joey can realistically assess events andor relationships and remain in satisfactory contact with the external world should intellectual emotional or social demands prove stressful then objective analysis and reasoning deteriorate emotions overwhelm disciplined behavior so that he no longer can exercise logical and selfcontrolled behavior this has been a lifelong chronic pattern emotions joey operates on a eight to ten year old level with poor capacities for purposeful and selfdisciplined behavior under stress surface behavior in supportive caring and tolerant surroundings that are not perceived as challenging can prove adaptive this is a thin veneer and when joey becomes upset he is potentially explosive and incapable of employing sufficient will over behavior when selfcontrol deteriorates joey lacks intellectual and emotional strength to maintain a reasonable level of adjustment and adaptation he rapidly and powerlessly regresses to impulsive acting out of immediate feelings and desires without awareness of the possible seriousness of his misbehavior social social relationships are very dependent immature and shallow in  relating that he plays tag or with matchbox cars he exhibits no understanding of how such a level of social interaction is exceptionally inappropriate and childish for his chronological age conscience knowledge of simple right and wrong acceptable and unacceptable behavior is sufficient for routine daily adjustment when not under stress he is motivated to conform and comply with societys rules guilt has the potential for constructively effecting behavior when calm when functioning on a childs level under stress despite the knowledge motivation and guilt that may be potentially productive conscience becomes immobilized following the uncontrollable actingout he is calmer will recognize having done something wrong appropriate remorse will be evident and he will know that he deserves punishment sexual there is no evidence of sexual obsession or uncontrollable urges specifically limited to sexuality there is no indication that joey is inclined to stalk or prey upon a chosen victim the sexual behavior accompanying his assault was a product of instant strong urges acted upon in a bizarre manner violence there is no evidence of preoccupation with violence when disturbed loss of rational thinking and emotional stability may result in uncontrollable regression to primitive behavior based upon the defendants history and test results dr weintraub concluded as follows  joey intellectually functions in the mental defective mild range  psychosocial development and skills are fixated within the eight to ten year old level of functioning and adaptation  tolerance for frustration and impulse suppression have been chronically severely handicapped resulting in repeated incidents of overpowering and uncontrollable agitation and acting out  at the time of the murder joey did not have the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his behavior  joey requires commitment to the forensic unit of a psychiatric hospital  joey is not competent to cooperate in the preparation and presentation of his defense and to stand trial dr weintraub testified that he thinks of the defendant as an  to  year old child who likes tag and playing with matchbox cars during the interviews dr weintraub said he had to repeat questions repeatedly in order to maintain communication with the defendant he remarked that the defendant was fearful of being taken out of his cell and taken to the basement for experimentation purposes defense counsel asked dr weintraub if the defendant had an ability to meaningfully communicate with counsel dr weintraub opined that the defendant would be handicapped in this area due to his impaired memory and impaired attention span when asked whether the defendant had the ability to follow testimony retain it and draw upon it at a later point dr weintraub noted that the defendant cant even do the alphabet and would not be able to effectively cooperate he noted that the defendant has no real understanding of whats going on and that he would not be able to contribute beyond his physical presence dr weintraub was asked if the defendant could testify on his own behalf the doctor felt that because of the defendants memory attention and concentration handicaps he would not be able to participate effectively he concluded that the defendant had not made it in life he would therefore not make it in a courtroom dr weintraub concluded that the defendants ability to participate would be at an eight to ten year old level dr weintraub was the last of  witnesses to testify for the defense from the evidence and testimony adduced by the defense the court entertains absolutely no doubt but that the defendant is a seriously impaired young man who is both mentally defective and mentally ill without conflicting testimony there would appear to be little question but that the court would declare this defendant to be incompetent to stand trial  the state called as its first witness david e raskin md chairman of the department of psychiatry of the medical center of delaware he is board certified in forensic psychiatry one of only  or so such specialists in the united states dr raskin reviewed various medical records concerning the defendant including the reports of dr mechanick and dr weintraub he saw the defendant on september    and   he administered to the defendant the mcgarry questions in order to assess the defendants competency based upon his interviews with the defendant dr raskin concluded that with reasonable medical certainty the following can be stated about mr shields capacities  he has a factual understanding of the courtroom and its procedures  he can manage his own behavior without trial disruption  he appears able to relate to his attorney i have not been able to interview his attorney to assess whether she is available to him in an empathic manner but i have no evidence that she is not she will need to talk to him in simple language and deal in an empathic manner with his anxieties  he can participate with his attorney in planning legal strategy in terms of providing her with information but he is not capable of developing a strategy with her  he understands the roles of various participants in the trial he is aware that his attorney is there to help him he is aware there is a prosecuting attorney he is aware that there is a judge and jury he is not entirely clear about the roles of each but can be educated further about this  he has a gross understanding of courtroom procedure he understands that the jury at some point will decide about what happens to him  he appreciates the charges against him he understands that he is being tried for murder  he understands the possible penalties including possible death or possible life in prison he does not understand what not guilty by reason of insanity means he believes in all probability he will receive a life sentence i believe he is capable of providing his attorney with available pertinent facts concerning the events this capacity could be gleaned from the two reports one by dr weintraub and one by dr mechanick which discuss and summarize what happened at the time of the crime these reports appear to me to be reasonably consistent in addition i have found his memory to be quite good in terms of reporting past events doctors who have treated him hospitalizations etc he will be able to assist his attorney in challenging prosecution reports about him if he is given structured and simple questions i believe he can testify relevantly  he is not entirely motivated towards selfdefense since he feels depressed and guilty about what he has done he is certainly however motivated towards participating with his attorney  in any way she feels would be helpful for him  i do not believe he has the capacity to realistically consider possible legal defense in his summary dr raskin related as follows mr shields has factual understanding of his charge the consequences of this charge and the legal system that will try him i do not believe he has the ability to appreciate or reason about the more abstract issues involved in the courtroom trial procedure i believe he does have the capacity to relate well listen to and help his attorney his attorney must be aware of the ways of relating to mildly retarded persons that will minimize anxiety and distraction and maximize useful participation the psychiatric condition which limits his capacity is mental retardation of a mild degree i have seen no clinical evidence of attention deficit disorder he concentrates on what i ask or tell him and his next day memory is excellent the treatment method for increasing capacities in mentally retarded persons who are educable would be through educational programs in the interest of being thorough i will interview mr shields to determine the effect going to court has had on his mental status dr raskin concludes his report with a recommendation that the trial judge should interview mr shields to determine whether his intellectual capacity is sufficient to meet the courts standards of the defendants diagnosis of attention deficit disorder dr raskin remarked that persons so diagnosed do poorly in unstructured class situations but do well in one to one relationships dr raskin therefore wondered why defense counsel has difficulty communicating with her client the defendant dr raskin recounted the defendant telling him in effect that his attorney told him she felt he shouldnt be in prison he should be in the delaware state hospital getting help dr raskin noted that the defendant understands very clearly that if he is found to be incompetent he doesnt have to stand trial hes afraid of trial and the consequences of a life sentence or execution the defendant is scared according to dr raskin who noted that every inmate is painfully aware of the consequences of going to trial dr raskin felt that neither mental retardation of a borderline to a mild degree nor attention deficit disorder hurts the defendants ability to work with his attorney the doctor noted that in dr weintraubs own testing there was not a single note about the defendant not being able to concentrate and that dr kozma noted in his report that the defendant is able to sit still and concentrate for an hour at a time dr raskin also opined that persons with mild mental retardation or attention deficit disorder do not suffer from memory impairment and he noted that what the defendant has told three doctors shows a very good memory when the defendant gets anxious however hell have more difficulties dr raskin suggested that the trial be structured with regard to the number of recesses so as to minimize the difficulties relating to memory as to the defendants ability to recall events dr raskin felt that if the defendant knows he is going to go to trial hell be able to do so as to the defendants feelings of guilt and depression dr raskin felt that such feelings would not reach the point of impeding him in his ability to follow the course of the trial and that these responses are all expected in that anyone charged with murder will have the same feelings on crossexamination dr raskin agreed that through all of the defendants medical records there was a clear and consistent  pattern of developmental disorders and severe emotional problems he opined that while the defendant has severe handicaps this fact was not the issue as he understood it dr raskin concluded from the september   interview that for good reason the defendant had induced incapacity since he has the idea that it would be better to be at the delaware state hospital than standing trial detective allen ruth of the new castle county police department was next called by the state he testified about the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the defendant and the statements obtained from him while he stated that he knew from a conversation he had with mrs shields that the defendant was slow had a short attention span and difficulty in communicating with adults det ruth felt that the defendant understood his rights and gave the statement because as the defendant told him he wanted to get something off his chest det ruth did not observe any concentration problems visavis the defendant during his interview with him he noted certain discrepancies between the defendants statement and the contents of the autopsy protocol on rebuttal the defendants father was recalled to the stand and testified that he told his son as he was being taken from mr shields new jersey residence on april   that you should have a lawyer he further testified that the defendant responded yes i want a lawyer also called in rebuttal was lt dennis godek who had investigated two incidents in  concerning the defendants possible involvement with two young females ages  and  although lt godek testified that when he interviewed the defendant on august   he felt the defendant understood that what they were talking about was serious the police report noted that joseph was not interviewed for a great deal of time due to his emotional condition and that there would be no prosecution of shields due to his mental condition and the victims inability to provide further info or to testify following the hearing and oral argument the court decided that an interview of the defendant by the court would be appropriate this was accomplished on november   during this colloquy the court noted that the defendant gave appropriate responses to most of the questions there seemed to be little delay between question and response while the court had to keep the questions simple knowing that it was dealing with a person of very limited intelligence nevertheless i did note that the defendant seemed to follow most of the questions with no real loss of concentration the following exchange is provided as an example q okay now do you think there will be a jury there or not a i dont know if there is or not q all right now if there is tell me what you think a jury would do a well jury is supposed to hear both sides of the story and they come up to you and they tell you that they decided q and based on what what would they make their decision on a see if youre guilty or if youre not guilty q how would they decide that a mostly they would talk at nighttime or during the day q would they decide that strike that you just told me that a jury might make a decision after talking about it a yeah q but how i mean on what would they make that decision a what decision q yes  a i really dont know what decision they can make q im not asking about the actual decision if you would they make a decision based on what they heard a mostly yes q okay and where would they hear that a mostly in a courtroom q okay if we go to trial in this case do you want to tell the jury your side of the story a no q how come a because i really dont know why q you dont know why what a i just dont know why q why what a talk to anybody that much q im sorry a i just dont know if i want to talk to the jury q okay but if you did want to talk to the jury would you tell the jury the truth a yes q would you want the jury to be fair a mostly yes q okay have you ever heard of the term railroaded a railroaded q yeah a no q you never heard of that term a defendant shook head in the negative q okay you wouldnt want the jury to be unfair would you a i dont know i really dont know what you mean q okay well let me put it this way you have kind of told me that a jury makes a decision by what they hear in a courtroom right a yes q now you want that decision to be the right decision dont we all want that a yeah q all right now just as we dont want them to make a wrong decision and we want them to be fair rather than unfair would you agree with that a yeah q now can you tell me why you agree with that a i agree with that because its like if you do get something you done a crime you have to they have to hear both sides of the story and thats when they hear both sides thats when they make a decision q okay and you want them to make that decision based on what they heard and not on any other factors a thats right q would that be a fair statement a yes q okay would you follow the advice of your lawyer ms perillo a yes i would q and why would you why would you follow her advice a because in terms i wouldnt understand all those things q so you would put your trust in her a yes q is that what youre saying to me a defendant nodded head in the affirmative q okay do you listen to her when she talks to you a yes i do q do you understand what she tells you a most of the time sometimes i dont q okay and when you dont why dont you understand a because some words are very big and they get me confused q okay you mean you dont understand some of the words she uses a yes q if we do go to trial what can happen to you a mostly get sentenced or there is a lot of other terms that i dont think of  right now mostly because they mostly get me upset q do you know if we go to trial how many options a jury might have how many decisions they could make a no i dont really know q okay can we go over them together a yes q okay and i want you to see if you can help me out first of all they can find you guilty do you understand what i mean by that a yeah q do you understand what i mean a yes q that would be a decision they would make what else could the jury do a mostly say youre innocent q okay they can find you not guilty thats another thing they could do isnt it a yeah q now if they found you guilty what could they decide with regard to your sentence a maybe life two life three q anything else a no i cant think of anything else q okay now when you say life tell me what you mean by that a what i mean by that thats where you live there for permanent q okay until when a until whenever you die dr raskin as mentioned previously recommended that the court conduct an interview with the defendant but this fact was not the sole predicate for conducting such an exercise following the hearing the court listened to states exhibit  the taped statement given by the defendant to the police on april   while there were some leading questions noted by the court again the court was struck by the appropriate responsiveness of the defendant to overall questioning the court wanted to see for itself whether its characterization of the april   taped interview had been properly inferred this then is the substance of the evidence adduced on the issue of competency to stand trial an analysis of the legal authorities which have examined this issue is now in order analysis the test for determining competency is codified at  delc § a which states in relevant part as follows whenever the court is satisfied after hearing that an accused person because of mental illness or mental defect is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to give evidence in his own defense or to instruct counsel on his behalf the court may order the accused person to be confined and treated in the delaware state hospital until he is capable of standing trial the abovequoted statute is simply another way of stating the test of legal competency that is whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him dusky v united states  us   s ct   l ed d   in drope v missouri  us   s ct   l ed d   the supreme court impliedly added to the dusky competency formulation the requirement that a defendant be able to assist in preparing his defense  us at   s ct at   l ed d at  dusky and drope have established a basic norm understandably and necessarily imprecise that permits individual judges to evaluate each case in the light of an individual defendants level of functioning in relation to the complexity of the case  the court is mindful that due process requires that a defendant be competent to stand trial pate v robinson  us   s ct   l ed d   and understands that the placement of an incompetent defendant before a jury on the issue of guilt or innocence does not reflect a reasoned interaction between an individual and his community but rather societal invective against an insensible object at the same time due process requires that the defendant be afforded a fair not a perfect trial and that he be able to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable not a perfect degree of rational understanding state v wynn delsuper  ad    as one court noted competency is to some extent a relative matter arrived at by taking into account the average level of ability of criminal defendants we cannot however exclude from trial all persons who lack the intelligence or legal sophistication to participate actively in their own defense that is not the standard by which we measure competency should we do so we would preclude the trial of a number of people who are indeed competent to stand trial as understood in the law the accused need not understand every legal nuance in order to be competent  state v guatney  neb   nwd   courts have looked to numerous factors in order to make a legal assessment on the competency issue as defense counsel points out in her october   memorandum of authorities the delaware supreme court in harris v state delsupr  ad   indicated that mental retardation any accompanying mental illness or disorder and defense counsels experience with the defendant are proper areas for exploration and consideration when attempting to determine competency id at  yet the task is often easier said than done it is extremely difficult for trial courts to reach a decision on a defendants competency to stand trial if the defendant is neither manifestly unable to understand the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense nor manifestly able to understand the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense competency is not something a person wears like a coat state v heger ndsupr  nwd    the situation is one where the totality of the circumstances the aggregate of a defendants indicia of incompetence should be considered although any one factor may be sufficient in some circumstances us v renfroe  fd   rd cir citing drope v missouri  us at   s ct at   l ed d at  the court must consider the full range of circumstances but is not necessarily bound by any one of them because the determination of competency is not susceptible to generalized concepts or theories but must be based upon the facts of the particular case cf renfroe supra at  discussing what evidence suffices to trigger the need for a competency hearing the issue of competency remains a very factsensitive inquiry the question of competence is often a difficult one in which a wide range of manifestations and subtle nuances are implicated drope v missouri  us at   s ct at   l ed d at  defendants counsel cites parson v state delsupr  ad   as authority for the proposition that amnesia andor memory impairment is a factor to be considered in assessing competency to stand trial based on this proposition counsel argues that the defendant due to his mental retardation and various developmental disorders suffers a memory impairment which equates with the amnesia as found in parson i disagree parson dealt with a situation where the defendant suffered total amnesia as to the events and time frame of the alleged crime the court relying on wilson v us  fd  dccir adopted a list of guidelines to be considered in a case where  total amnesia exists one of these factors was whether or not the memory lapse would prevent the defendant from asserting any available defense such as alibi or insanity thus if the state were relying on an eyewitness or the defendant interposed an insanity defense amnesia as to the events of the alleged crime could require a finding of incompetency parson supra at  us ex rel parson v anderson  fd    rd cir federal habeas proceeding in same action in us ex rel parson supra the third circuit court of appeals when considering parsons appeal of denial of his habeas petition stated further that if the state had relied on statements made by parson during the period covered by his amnesia competency also would be very questionable id at  defense counsel asserts that because the defendant will interpose an insanity defense and also because the state will apparently rely on the defendants statement in its case in chief the defendant must be found incompetent under the parson rationale however to my mind there are significant differences which militate against such an application the defendant in parson suffered total amnesia as to the events immediately before during and subsequent to the commission of the crime charged here the defendant apparently suffers some memory impairment but clearly not total amnesia he was able to give a very detailed description of the sequence of events surrounding the incident in question in response to questioning by police he later went over the events surrounding the incident in his second interview with dr mechanick and in an interview with dr weintraub although these three accounts differ somewhat they are substantially the same and are clearly consistent in many details to my mind this indicates that any memory impairment suffered by the defendant is not such an impediment to his ability to assist his defense counsel as to render him incompetent to stand trial finally there is the question of using the defendants statements against him an issue raised by the third circuit court of appeals in us ex rel parson supra in that case the statements in question were made to the police during the period of which parson had no memory and within a short time after the commission of the crime here the statement given by the defendant was taken more than a day after the event it was not a statement just blurted out while the defendant was in shock and which he now is unable to remember the parson rationale is plainly inapplicable in this case without an unjustified quantum expansion of its application defense counsel has cited to the court several authorities from other jurisdictions which arguably support a finding of incompetence in the matter sub judice although all are quite similar to the facts under consideration obvious differences  again lead the court to the conclusion that they are not sufficiently persuasive of the eight authorities cited by defense counsel three deal with the issue of whether a competency hearing should have been held williams v state texapp  swd   hill v state flasupr  so d   and silverstein v henderson  fd  nd cir all deal with the quality and quantum of evidence necessary to invoke the need for an evidentiary hearing as to competency as stated in williams v state the court must  assay just the evidence tending to show incompetency putting aside all competing indications of competency to find whether there is some evidence a quantity more than none or a scintilla that rationally may lead to a conclusion of incompetency id at  quoting sisco v state texcr app  swd   this is not the standard by which ones competency is appraised at an actual hearing admittedly factors relevant to whether inquiry as to competency is constitutionally necessary are also relevant regarding the actual issue of competency itself the three cases cited clearly found sufficient evidence to support the need for a hearing but made no claim or comment beyond that point moreover there is no indication that the evidence adduced would in the respective courts opinions be sufficient to support a claim of incompetency mental retardation by itself is not usually sufficient to support a finding of incompetence to stand trial ie being mentally retarded is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for being found incompetent state v heger supra at  but see state v rogers lasupr  so d   defendant so severely retarded that in some critical areas had capacity of three year old and found incompetent almost invariably where a mentally retarded defendant has been found incompetent the retardation has been accompanied by some form of extreme psychologicalpsychiatric disorder this is true in four of the cases cited by defense counsel see state v flores lasupr  so d    defendant unable to distinguish between his fantasies and actual past events as well as subject to psychotic episodes owens v state tenn crapp  swd    evidence that defendant was so mentally disturbed that he was not able to defend himself required competency hearing silverstein supra at   evidence that defendant had long institutional history as well as previous diagnoses finding him retarded and possibly schizophrenic triggered need for competency hearing strickland v francis  fd   th cir defendant retarded and suffering from severe mental disorder periods of irrationality delusions of persecution by the cia paranoia and frequently having no grasp of the world around him the defendant has been diagnosed as suffering from no such psychotic disorder but rather mild or borderline mental retardation attentiondeficit hyperactivity  disorder as well as intellectual developmental deficits conflicting testimony has been offered as to the further diagnosis of a conduct disorder however assuming arguendo that the diagnosis of conduct disorder is correct even in combination with attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder mild or borderline mental retardation and intellectual developmental deficits it would not appear to this court to be so disabling as to automatically trigger a finding of incompetency to stand trial in fact for the reasons which follow i reach the opposite conclusion a defendant is competent to stand trial if he understands questions terms and proceedings which are put to him in simple words perhaps using very concrete examples see us v glover  fd   th cir counsel would have to do no less if the defendant were an actual child whose chronological age matched his mental age and who was being tried as an adult on a charge similar to the one here see  delc §  a two of the cases cited by defense counsel presented situations where physical or developmental speech impediments or deficits made any effective communication almost impossible hill supra at  defendant had severe speech problem which made communication with others difficult  and made him unable to defend himself when unjustly accused of something state v williams lasupr  so d    defendant had severe speech disorder and marked speech impediment which resulted in an impaired ability to communicate and thus disabled him both in advising counsel of facts pertinent to his defense and in testifying a third case presented what appears to have been a psychologically based inability to communicate meaningfully about the case strickland supra at  defendant was unable to communicate in any fashion about the incidents relating to his arrest or pending trial and n  description of nonsense conversation between counsel and defendant in the instant case however the defendant is able to both comprehend questions and respond fairly promptly with appropriate answers there appears to be no evidence of any speech impediment nor a psychological inability to communicate the defendants ability to communicate limited though it may be is apparent from listening to the tape of his interview with the police and from reviewing the transcript of the courts november   colloquy with the defendant finally four of the cases cited by defense counsel dealt with appellate review of the actual competency determination in all four cases the trial courts determination of competency was reversed as being clearly against the weight of the evidence these were all situations in which strong consistent independent expert testimony was rejected for little or no logical reason for example in strickland supra a twomember sanity commission of stateemployed psychiatrists found the defendant incompetent based on an extensive and consistent history of severe mentalemotional problems the jury chose to disregard this expert testimony in favor of lay opinion testimony that the defendant was feigning his symptoms the eleventh circuit determined that there were no objective reasons for the jury to reject the expert testimony especially where the primary lay testimony came from a jailor who had a sixth grade education had no psychiatric or psychological training did not have any knowledge of stricklands overwhelmingly consistent mental history and scores on sophisticated psychological tests and who characterized the defendant as intelligent when the defendant had an iq of  and was in fact borderlineretarded strickland  fd at    in state v rogers supra a twoperson sanity commission appointed by the court found the defendant incompetent on the basis of extensive testing and interviews showing that he was too severely retarded to be held competent because of difficulties with obtaining transcripts of previous proceedings a third psychiatrist was appointed and a second hearing held one of the initial psychiatrists testified as well as the newly appointed one the third psychiatrist found the defendant competent but did not do any testing and in fact stated that no testing would change his opinion that the defendant could assist counsel at trial id at  after reviewing the evidence the louisiana supreme court stated acceptance of the third psychiatrists inadequately supported conclusion in the face of contrary medical opinion having a substantial factual basis was tantamount to turning the courts judicial function over to the doctor  id at  the other cited cases present similar situations of rejection of supported expert testimony in favor of inadequately or nonsupported testimony state v flores supra trial court accepted coroners conclusion of competency based only on defendants own statements that he was competent over independent sanity commission finding of incompetency state v williams supra no evidence presented to support trial courts rejection of sanity commissions determination of incompetency that is not the case here dr raskin had access to all records testing and expert reports pertaining to the defendant and obviously considered them in forming his opinion it is clear that his determination of competency rests on an adequate basis unlike the cases cited by defense counsel a careful reading of the duskydrope test of competency demonstrates three distinct factors to be requisite a defendant must be able  to consult with defense counsel  to otherwise assist with his defense and  to have both a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings how does the court determine whether these criteria have been met stated otherwise what factors should be considered by the court in making a determination of competency dr raskins use of the  mcgarry functions is helpful in enabling the court to decide the defendants status visavis the abovenoted three factors chief justice krivosha of the supreme court of nebraska in his concurring opinion in state v guatney supra listed twenty factors which may facilitate the courts arrival at the appropriate conclusion with regard to competency i concur completely with the majority opinion herein i wish however to make brief comment with regard to how a trial court may satisfy itself that indeed an accused meets the threefold test for competency while the test for determining mental competency to stand trial as established in state v crenshaw  neb   nwd   and state v klatt  neb   nwd   standing alone may be difficult to apply other cases have discussed a number of factors which are of aid to a court in arriving at an appropriate conclusion the factors which have been considered in determining competency include the following  that the defendant has sufficient mental capacity to appreciate his presence in relation to time place and things  that his elementary mental processes are such that he understands that he is in a court of law charged with a criminal offense  that he realizes there is a judge on the bench  that he understands that there is a prosecutor present who will try to convict him of a criminal charge  that he has a lawyer who will undertake to defend him against the charge  that he knows that he will be expected to tell his lawyer all he knows or remembers about the events involved in the alleged crime  that he understands that there will be a jury present to pass upon evidence in determining his guilt or innocence  that he has sufficient memory to relate answers to questions posed to him  that he has established rapport with his lawyer  that he can follow the testimony reasonably well  that he has the ability to meet stresses without his rationality or judgment breaking down  that he has at least minimal contact with reality  that he has the minimum intelligence necessary to grasp the events taking place  that he can confer coherently with some appreciation of proceedings  that he can both give and receive advice from his attorneys  that he can divulge facts without paranoid distress  that he can  decide upon a plea  that he can testify if necessary  that he can make simple decisions and  that he has a desire for justice rather than undeserved punishment wieter v settle  f supp  wdmo raithel v state  md   ad   comment incompetency to stand trial  harvlrev   it should be kept in mind that in order to establish competency it is not necessary that an accused meet all of the above factors but only that considering the various factors as a whole one is compelled to conclude that the accused has the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him to comprehend his own condition in reference to such proceedings and to make a rational defense by using some or all of the enumerated factors a trial court should be aided in arriving at an appropriate conclusion guatney  nwd at  in people v henderson  illappd   illdec   ned   the defendant could not have satisfied all of the mcgarry functions or all of the twenty guatney factors after all hendersons full scale iq had been scored at  indicative of a high grade mental defective yet the court there affirmed a finding of competency so too in state v heger supra where the defendants fullscale iq was  at the upper limit of mental retardation in united states v glover supra the defendants fullscale iq was reported at  placing him in the category of mental defective his reading ability was between the first and second grade levels yet on the issue of competency the court stated the fact that a defendant might not understand the proceedings unless they are explained to him in simple language would put an additional burden on defense counsel but certainly does not establish that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial id at  and that is the same conclusion this court reaches in the case sub judice the court accepts the findings of the experts that joseph shields jr suffers from borderline or mild mental retardation with a fullscale iq of  has attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder and other developmental disorders still the fact remains that on an unsophisticated level the defendant functions sufficiently well to warrant a finding of competency granted the defendant does not and indeed cannot satisfy all of the mcgarry functions or all of the guatney factors which are used to assess competency nevertheless enough are satisfied to allow the trial to go forward that dr weintraub and dr mechanick came to the opposite conclusion is of no moment since where there is conflict in expert testimony the factfinder is free to adopt the opinions of some and reject others united states v oneal  fd  th cir and while defense counsels opinion is a factor to consider it is not dispositivesee state v heger supra where the court stated we believe a trial attorneys opinion regarding a defendants ability to understand legal concepts which are part and parcel of the legal proceedings against him and to assist counsel in his own defense should be given due consideration by the trial judge in making his decision about a defendants competency to stand trial however just as expert medical testimony is not controlling in the courts determination of competency neither is expert legal testimony controlling id at  see also diaz v state del supr  ad    it must be understood that competency to stand trial is a legal not a medical issue state v bertrand  nh   ad   any  psychiatric conclusion if arrived at is not and cannot be legally binding at most it is merely opinion testimony to be resolved by the legal finder of fact in the same manner as is the testimony of all expert expressed conclusions any difference between legal and psychiatric disciplines respecting the latter proposition arises from failure to appreciate that opinion testimony is one of those practical anomalies of the law of evidence devised to help the finder of fact understand technical subjects on which they would be required to speculate or guess without some expert explanation par added see burger cir js limited concurring opinion blocker v united states supra at page  of  fd  emphasis in original wieter v settle wdmo  f supp    because the purposes of the legal and psychiatric disciplines are different it is not surprising that legal and psychiatric conclusions on competency to stand trial might differ as well from a legal standpoint competency requires at a minimum that the defendant be sufficiently coherent to provide his counsel with information necessary or relevant to constructing a defense raithel v state  md   ad   the united states district court for the western district of missouri in the case of wieter v settle supra expressed it thusly  when it is evidentially made to appear in a  proceeding by a person under arrest status   that he has mental capacity to appreciate his presence in relation to time place and things  that his elementary mental processes are such that he apprehends ie seizes and grasps with what mind he has that he is in a court of justice charged with a criminal offense  that there is a judge on the bench  a prosecutor present who will try to convict him of a criminal charge  that he has a lawyer selfemployed or courtappointed who will undertake to defend him against that charge  that he will be expected to tell his lawyer the circumstances to the best of his mental ability whether colored or not by mental aberration the facts surrounding him at the time and place where the law violation is alleged to have been committed  that there is or will be a jury present to pass upon evidence adduced as to his guilt or innocence of such charge and  he has memory sufficient to relate those things in his own personal manner such a person from a consideration of legal standards should be considered mentally competent to stand trial id at   what is gleaned from the above authorities is that from a legal standpoint the competency threshold is quite low it is neither very demanding nor exacting the standard by which a defendants competency  is measured is not that of the reasonable person but rather of the average criminal defendant state v guatney supra incompetency must be a relative judgment which takes into account the average level of ability of criminal defendants many defendants lack the intelligence or the legal sophisication to participate actively in the conduct of their defense but enlarging the class of persons considered incompetent to stand trial to include all such defendants would fundamentally alter the administration of the criminal law the standard of rational understanding emphasized in dusky must be taken to mean no more than that the defendant be able to confer coherently with counsel and have some appreciation of the significance of the proceeding and his involvement in it many defendants who have some intellectual or physical handicap or emotional disturbance preventing them from functioning at their normal level of effectiveness can still meet such a standard the question is one of degree the purpose of the law is not to attempt to compensate all the inevitable disparities in innate abilities among defendants but to identify those instances where the purposes of incompetency law are most directly relevant comment incompetency to stand trial  harvlrev    conclusion based upon the findings of dr raskin the observations of detective allen ruth my own observations of the defendant and in brief the testimony adduced during the hearing as well as the standards enunciated in state v guatney supra united states v glover supra raithel v state supra wieter v settle supra i conclude that the defendant although mentally defective and mentally ill possesses the mental capacity to appreciate his presence in relation to time place and things he grasps with what limited intellect he has that he has been charged with serious crimes including murder he understands that i am a judge that ms perillo is his public defender whose job it is to defend him and that there are two prosecutors for the state he likes his lawyer and to the best of his ability has told her of the facts surrounding the incident he knows that a jury will decide whether or not he is guilty and that he can be sentenced to life in prison if convicted he is in brief sufficiently coherent to provide his attorney with information necessary or relevant to constructing a defense from the legal perspective it is clear to the court that the state has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant while seriously impaired is nevertheless competent to stand trial so ordered notes  it must be understood that what follows is merely a capsule of the

his listening to the defendants taped statement and discussions he had with dr weintraub and defense counsel  dr weintraub also asked the defendant to explain the events leading up to his incarceration this account is contained in dr weintraubs report as follows concerning what occurred leading to the charge joey was involved in a serious argument with the family which included his mother her boyfriend and his brother went outside with my brother my brother said to head home i didnt head home i just went down to the woods and walked around thats when that little girl came down there asking all those questions i told her to go away she wouldnt go so i threw her in where did you throw her in in this creek water where the incident happened what incident where she died what made her die the jagged rock on the bottom what did you do after you threw her in i took her out at that time my anger went out of control what happened i really dont like to talk about it got to anyway stuck a stick in her throat i dont know why then what did you do nothing else stuck the stick in her mouth theyre trying to say i stuck the stick up her crotch did you do that i did theyre trying to say i stuck it through her belly button but that i didnt do what happened after that last thing i remember doing is hitting her over the head with a big rock then just left and went home joey believed that the victim berenda sic coxe had died probably from the water he recalls the victim looked like just a regular person after the attack he saw no blood because couldnt see shit out there in the woods it was six oclock he returned home and got in a major argument again with my mother and brother this time about stupid dirt bike my brother tried to say i took his out for joy riding and i didnt until arrested joey did not recall the event and he is unable to remember or describe his feelings he now does think about the girl all the time and that i wish i didnt do it that i could have talked to my moms boyfriend instead or a friend then bring the problems out im just plain upset i cant explain it  because of insufficient reading ability the defendant could not do the mmpi  the mcgarry questions are also known as the competency to stand trial instrument which dr raskin described as a widely used assessment procedure in the area of competency to stand trial the mcgarry questions states exhibit  are as follows performance of defendant role may require the ability to  consider realistically the possible legal defenses  manage ones own behavior to avoid trial disruptions  relate to attorney  participate with attorney in planning legal strategy  understand the roles of various participants in the trial  understand court procedure  appreciate the charges  appreciate the range and nature of possible penalties  perceive realistically the likely outcome of the trial  provide attorney with available pertinent facts concerning the offense  challenge prosecution witnesses  testify relevantly  be motivated toward selfdefense  see states exhibit   such an interview is discussed infra  dr frederick kozmas psychological test results report dated may   supra see defendants exhibit   defense counsels crossexamination of dr raskin was to say the least vigorous yet dr raskin was steadfast in his conclusion that all of the diagnoses do not answer the central question of capacity to stand trial  counsel inadvertently omitted to introduce the autopsy protocol during the hearing without objection a copy thereof was later submitted by the state and marked by the court as states exhibit   because there are several suppression motions pending the court will not herein address this suppression issue  see defendants exhibit   see slovenko the developing law on competency to stand trial  j psychiatry  l    see aba criminal justice mental health standards  commentary at p    the wilson guidelines to be considered are as follows  the extent to which the amnesia affects his ability to consult with his lawyer  the extent to which the amnesia affects the defendants ability to testify in his own behalf  the extent to which the evidence in the suit could be extrinsically reconstructed in view of the defendants amnesia including evidence relating to the crime itself as well as any reasonably possible alibi  the extent to which the government assisted the defendant and his counsel in that reconstruction  the strength of the prosecutions case that is whether it is such as to negate all reasonable hypothesis of innocence in this connection if there is any substantial possibility shown by the evidence that the accused could but for his amnesia establish an alibi or other defense then it should be presumed that he would have been able to do so and  any other facts and circumstances which would indicate whether or not the defendant had a fair trial  but see senior circuit judge fahys dissent in wilson where he stated that even with the protections afforded by the guidelines it was still a violation of due process to find the defendant competent he also felt it to be a violation of the defendants sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel  as there were no eyewitnesses to the alleged crimes the court need not consider this parson factor  see generally diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders rd ed revised  hereinafter dsmiiir pp  diagnostic criteria for mental retardation a significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning an iq of  or below on an individually administered iq test b concurrent deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning ie the persons effectiveness in meeting the standards expected for his or her age by his or her cultural group in areas such as social skills and responsibility communication daily living skills personal independence and selfsufficiency c onset before the age of     behavioral symptoms commonly seen in mental retardation include passivity dependency low selfesteem low frustration tolerance aggressiveness poor impulse control and stereotyped selfstimulating and selfinjurious behavior in some cases these behaviors may be learned and conditioned by environmental factors in other cases they may be linked to an underlying physical disorder the prevalence of other mental disorders is at least three or four times greater among people with mental retardation than in the general population    people with mental retardation are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by others such as being physically and sexually abused or being denied rights and opportunities  see generally dsmiiir pp  the essential features of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder are developmentally inappropriate degrees of inattention impulsiveness and hyperactivity people with the disorder generally display some disturbance in each of these areas but to varying degrees    in older children and adolescents the most prominent features tend to be excessive fidgeting and restlessness rather than gross motor overactivity inattention and impulsiveness may contribute to failure to complete assigned tasks or instructions or careless performance of assigned work    associated features vary as a function of age and include low selfesteem mood lability low frustration tolerance and temper outbursts    followup studies of clinic samples indicate that approximately onethird of children with adhd continue to show some signs of the disorder in adulthood studies have indicated that the following features predict a poor course coexisting conduct disorder low iq and severe mental disorder in the parents    in mental retardation there may be many of the features of adhd because of the generalized delay in intellectual development the additional diagnosis of adhd is made only if the relevant symptoms are excessive for the childs mental age  see generally dsmiiir pp  these are disorders that are characterized by inadequate development of specific academic language speech and motor skills and that are not due to demonstrable physical or neurologic disorders a pervasive developmental disorder mental retardation or deficient educational opportunities    however a diagnosis of mental retardation in a child does not preclude the additional diagnosis of a specific developmental disorder for example a child with an iq of  should with adequate schooling be able to read simple materials if the childs ability to read is markedly below what would be expected given an iq of  both mental retardation and developmental reading disorder should be diagnosed  see generally dsmiiir pp  the essential feature of conduct disorder is a persistent pattern of conduct in which the basic rights of others and major ageappropriate societal norms or rules are violated the behavior pattern typically is present in the home at school with peers and in the community the conduct problems are more serious than those seen in oppositional defiant disorder physical aggression is common children or adolescents with this disorder usually initiate aggression may be physically cruel to other people or to animals and frequently deliberately destory other peoples property this may include firesetting they may engage in stealing with conforntation of the victim as in mugging pursesnatching extortion or armed robbery at later ages the physical violence may take the form of rape assault or in rare cases homicide covert stealing is common this may range from borrowing others possessions to shoplifting forgery and breaking into someone elses house building or car lying and cheating in games or in schoolwork are common often a youngster with this disorder is truant from school and may run away from home    selfesteem is usually low though the person may project an image of toughness poor frustration tolerance irritability temper outbursts and provocative recklessness are frequent characteristics symptoms of anxiety and depression are common academic achievement particularly in reading and other verbal skills is often below the level expected on the basis of intelligence and age attentional difficulties impulsiveness and hyperactivity are very common especially in childhood attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder and specific developmental disorders are common associated diagnoses  in making this determination the strickland court assessed four factors weighing on when a finderoffact is justified in disregarding expert testimony in favor of lay testimony to my mind these same factors are also relevant when balancing different expert testimony these factors taken from brock v us  fd  th cir quoting mims v us  fd   th cir are  the correctness or adequacy of the factual assumptions on which the expert opinion is based  possible bias in the experts appraisal of the defendants condition  inconsistencies in the experts testimony or material variations between experts and  the relevance and strength of the contrary lay or expert testimony brock at   in fact the third psychiatrist stated at the end of his testimony i would like to make a correction im only saying that i feel he could assist his attorney im not saying that hes competent thats someone elses department rogers  so d at   see aba criminal justice mental health standards  commentary at p    dr raskin noted that the defendant is not capable of developing a strategy with his attorney and does not have the capacity to realistically consider possible legal defenses he did note however that the defendant could participate with his attorney in planning legal strategy in terms of providing her with information  while defense counsel did not testify her views on the matter were clear from her questioning of the witnesses and through the legal arguments she made to the court  defense counsel has also raised the novel question of a preemptive claim of involuntary ineffectiveness of counsel under the terms of strickland v washington  us   s ct   l ed d   this same issue was raised by judge fahy in his dissent in wilson supra see fn  supra however as noted previously wilson involved a case of total amnesia as to the commission of the alleged crime under that specific circumstance arguably no attorney could provide an effective defense for the defendant thus again arguably a finding of incompetence was mandated because even the minimum required by raithel supra could not be met yet even in wilson the court found the defendant competent when the guidelines discussed therein were applied here the defendant unlike wilson has recall of the events and can provide the required information to his counsel this is not a situation where no attorney could provide an adequate defense present defense counsel is in fact providing a more than merely adequate defense as evidenced by her vigorous intelligent and thorough advocacy on behalf of her client ineffectiveness of counsel in this case would go to the failure of counsel to appropriately communicate with the defendant andor act upon those communications there is no such failure evidenced here  he declined to acknowledge to me the possibility of a death sentence search this case google scholar google books legal blogs google web bing web google news google
