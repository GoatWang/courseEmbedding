markets and provides investors with a net return series that over multiple years exceeds that of the major global developed and emerging equity indices with a low correlation to those indices we seek to exploit pricing inefficiencies in frontier equity markets our investment approach uses both topdown country factors and bottomup company factors at the country level we examine sovereign risk and calculate country scores that measure currency vulnerability at the company level we model each companys discounted cash flow using our proprietary valuation tool that accounts for expected exchange rate changes and fading rates of return on invested capital and profit growth as time passes ultimately we aim to own solid businesses at attractive prices in stable or improving countries frontaura
