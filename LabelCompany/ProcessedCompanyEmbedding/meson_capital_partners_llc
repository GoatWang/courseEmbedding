today mailed its definitive proxy statement in connection with the companys annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to take place on february  sevcon is a global supplier of control and power solutions for zeroemission electric and hybrid vehicles the company is based in southborough maryan j morris cfa president of meson and a current director of sevcon today issued on behalf of meson the following statementwe believe the recent behavior of the sevcon board including a rushed decision to amend the companys charter represents a troubling manipulation of corporate governance principles to wrongfully insulate the sevcon board this entrenchment scheme which was adopted at a hastily called board meeting has only one practical effect to replace me a director beneficially owning  of the company with a retired director shareholders chose not to reelect in  and to do so a full year before my term is scheduled to end meson capital and its nominees seek to represent the best interests of all stockholders we believe the costly solicitation the company has launched to remove me is direct retaliation for mesons moves to improve director composition having purchased  times more stock than all current directors combined i believe that my goals are truly aligned with the best interests of shareholdersmorris emphasized that sevcon should be acting to secure early mover advantage as the global automotive industry dramatically accelerates its shift to electrification and related technologies one of mesons highly qualified nominees tony posawatz led the revolutionary chevy volt program at gm and is uniquely suited to help sevcon position itself for the future he describes the current industry situation as nothing less than a complete paradigm shift that requires the most capable people to shape the future of the company for success meson is confident shareholders will understand that the boards questionable decision to pursue a repetitive destaggering initiative is a distraction from the important work of responding to the automotive industrys revolutionary change it is up to shareholders to decide what future they want for sevconsuccessfully participating in this changing environment requires a sevcon board that possess a new level of expertise added morris it calls for the ability to act with agility it mandates both solid planning and a commitment to ensure management meets product goals and financial expectations and it must be dedicated to building value for all shareholdersour intent has never been to take control of the company as has been falsely claimed instead we have repeatedly and demonstrably tried to work collaboratively with the board to resolve the companys important strategic business issues unfortunately our efforts to resolve this proxy contest have been doggedly rebuffed by chairman matt goldfarb he owns no shares in the company and continues to collect an increasing number of board feesmesons uniquely qualified slate of nominees offers the skills and resources necessary to implement changes that will deliver positive performance at this critical juncture in company history the impressive team of tony shvet bryan and

its potential and will continue to do so as long as entrenched board members led by matthew goldfarb ignore reality of tectonic changes in electric vehicle industry emphasizes new business paradigm requires new skills and that mesons highly qualified nominees offer the vision expertise leadership and handson skills to build value for all stockholders urges stockholders not to be misled  meson has advocated for all stockholder interests since ryan morris joined sevcons board in december  now the other directors want to silence that unapologetic advocacy by making inaccurate and untruthful claims to further entrench their own parochial interests stockholders should fight for qualified board leadership and fair and effective corporate governance by voting the gold proxy card einpresswirecom  meson capital partners llc meson a major and longterm stockholder of sevcon inc nasdaq sev sevcon or the company with approximately  of the companys outstanding shares today issued an open letter to the companys board of directors the full text of the letter is included below to our fellow stockholders sevcon inc your company sevcon or the company is at a historically important inflection point and you get to decide its future direction it is important for you to have the full story before you decide we believe sevcon has tremendous potential waiting to be exploited technological market and regulatory forces are aligning to create a strong tailwind that will transform the electronic vehicle industry it is mission critical for sevcon to be at the forefront of this tectonic change if all stockholders are going to benefit from the increase in value that can and should be generated we had the vision to foresee this opportunity and believe we have the plans and nominees to capitalize on these powerful trends winning is never easy especially in a market that is becoming dramatically more competitive with its global growth sevcon needs the best people at the top setting the tone for the organization and raising the standard to the level being required by the market reality we are meson capital together with its affiliates meson or we an investment firm focusing on transforming established companies that are in rapidly changing markets that currently beneficially owns approximately  of sevcons outstanding shares making us the companys second largest stockholder we believe that our concentrated longterm ownership of sevcon naturally aligns our interests with those of fellow stockholders generally our president ryan morris has been advocating for your interests since joining sevcons board of directors board in december  now the other directors on the board the status quo directors want to silence that unapologetic advocacy do not let them your board is attempting to squeeze your greatest advocate from the board the statusquo directors forced the issue consider that leading up to the rapidly approaching  annual meeting scheduled for february th the nominating and governance committee of the board interviewed and invited current meson nominee bryan boches to join the board to replace william j ketelhut and then inexplicably reversed this decision the nominating and governance committee chaired by matthew goldfarb chose not to interview several other highly qualified nominees deciding instead to put forth a stock analyst from a shuttering oilfocused hedge fund the board formed a proxy committee consisting of among others a nonindependent director ceo matt boyle and mr goldfarb to act as a shadow board in advance of the annual meeting the board repeatedly rejected mesons attempts to quickly reasonably and quietly settle its differences the board responded to mesons lawful exercise of its nomination rights by adopting a governance change on christmas eve morning designed solely to replace the boards one true stockholder representative with a retired director who was not reelected to the board by you the stockholders last year what does that say about the boards respect for the stockholder franchise the board anticipates squandering  on this proxy contest they have precipitated ask yourself are these really the actions of board committed to effective corporate governance stockholder engagement and responsiveness let alone one that is focused on maximizing value for stockholders we did not want this fight we were willing to settle amicably on reasonable terms and have never sought to add more than three new directors to an eightmember board but were met with aggression insults and accusations with zero supporting facts enough is enough it is time for you the stockholders to decide who will lead you on this journey towards future growth for sevcon an industry in the throes of rapid change the electric and hybrid vehicle industry is experiencing unprecedented change a series of factors  regulatory market and technological  are converging to create massive tailwinds to push the industry forward with the right plan and leadership we believe sevcon can benefit mightily ryan morris described the market changes and opportunity in detail in the investor presentation that he created and gave at an investment conference on december th a presentation that was largely lifted by the company without attribution and presented to iss last week by sevcon as its own today is the inflection point for electric vehicles  the market is growing exponentially overlapping forces are driving this lithiumion batteries continue to get approximately  cheaper annually tightening emissions regulations and environmental awareness electrification enables best in class performance batteries and motors are commodities with low gross margins but the controllers engineering challenges are complex with high margins the market for controllers is fragmented and no supplier offers an integrated electric drivetrain this is a challenging problem requiring engineering talent business savvy and a deep understanding of product design cycles if you could consolidate the controller bottleneck and offer a turnkey system solution you could create tremendous stockholder value in the next two to three years sevcon can take advantage by making itself a focused industry leader with proper planning execution and leadership but inadequate vision and board leadership can result in sevcon being permanently left behind on its current course sevcon is at risk of being halfway across the gap between the niche industrial markets that it has neglected and the massive onroad automotive markets where it has made some modest inroads but is dramatically subscale do not be misled by the companys speculative projections and anticipated future results the market for sevcons products has historically been relatively small and uncompetitive focused on industrial applications in  the market for onroad electric vehicles began to grow rapidly and attracted much more aggressive and competitive players under the current board sevcon proved that is was incapable of creating stockholder value in a small uncompetitive industrial market how can stockholders expect these exact same individuals to rise to a vastly higher level of competition and market change all is not lost  we are your advocate for value creation since proudly joining the board in december  as a nominee of gamco sevcons largest stockholder ryan morris has been challenging old ideas and stale ways of doing business he and meson have purchased times more stock than all of the current directors combined aligning his interests with all shareholders he is primarily responsible for formulating and drafting the first truly comprehensive business strategyplans sevcon ever had the statusquo directors are now trying to take credit for these forward leaning steps despite historically advocating for hiring the bare minimum of engineering talent and only if it would lead to immediate results and rejecting to even vote on a modest rd budget increase immediately before mr morris became chairman in july  introducing impressive new candidates with important industry experience to upgrade your board for your benefit responsibly exercising director oversight by insisting on measurable results and true accountability collaboratively putting in time and effort far beyond any of the statusquo directors to drive stockholder value sourcing the financing that enabled the bassi acquisition to be possible and providing subsequent equity that prevented the company from violating its debt covenants after management widely missed targets developing relationships with leading north american academic institutions to improve engineering recruiting which has already yielded measurable results developing relationships and potential partnerships with world leaders in advanced motor technologies and highspeed charging infrastructure that present unique growth opportunities for sevcon your vote can now give sevcon three new uniquely qualified directors to focus sevcon on these nowornever opportunities and on the challenges facing the company in the next one to three years the dialog and debate in the boardroom must be informed and driven by those that understand the market and have experienced success in similar situations the company and the market will change in real time so there is no substitute for qualified individuals at the top setting the tone a real plan for the future if elected our nominees will seek to do the following implement a focused strategy in the face of constantly changing market dynamics and availability of key talent refocus on the offroad  industrial markets where sevcon brings a new competitive advantage thanks to changes in li technology shorter sales cycles and relatively smaller markets mean sevcon can be profitable in a shorter period of time sales efforts need to be redesigned around applications rather than geographic regions to align better with engineering teams accelerate efforts to penetrate rapidly growing onroad markets in a focused way for applications that sevcon has a competitive advantage while outflanking inevitable collisions with much larger competitors as they begin to enter the market in higher volume applications implement a people first culture for empowering executives and engineers in order to recruit the best engineering and management talent sevcon currently lacks any inhouse recruiting and onboarding function which is absolutely an essential requirement to hire the best talent in an increasingly competitive market develop sevcon into a visible thought leader in the power electronics subsystem space by partnering with leading ev advocates to create a wide platform for recruiting and sales efforts as hundreds of smaller players shift towards electrification develop forward deployed engineering programs to have sevcon engineers continuously onsite at key customers to integrate more with their roadmap and engineering teams for the charger business develop key strategic partnerships with utilities and independent charging infrastructure players now to design highspeed multistall charge infrastructure systems recognizing their important market role in the next one to three years develop accounting functionality to solve complex global issues and fixing material control weaknesses manage internal organizational and structural transition from a nogrowth company to a fastgrowth company recruit key senior executive talent and develop succession plans develop transparent performancealigned incentive plans that hold management accountable to appropriate goals develop effective board evaluation recruiting and succession processes develop early stage automotive industry connections including in north america where sevcon has not penetrated at all and develop and execute growth financing plans that maximize value for stockholders while reducing

charging bryan boches  is a serial founder experienced executive and investor with proven success in transforming an auto parts firm larger than sevcon shvetank jain  is a serial founder and ceo at software technology companies with multiple successes scaling engineering teams including a mm exit the statusquo directors want you to believe that reappointing two directors that retired last year and a coal mining executive connected to multiple bankruptcies is the dream team to maximize sevcons future value matt goldfarb  after  jobs in  years at questionable securities firms that either a went bankrupt b were charged by regulators or c terminated him he served as ceo of coal miner xinergy ltd where he was compensated mm as stockholders incurred mm in losses and then filed bankruptcy shortly after he resigned currently mr goldfarb serves as the ceo of cline mining a coal miner that filed bankruptcy one year after he joined he was not part of the pep boys deal team as he falsely takes credit for he joined the board of pep boys months after the sale was in motion he has purchased zero shares of sevcon in direct violation of company director stock ownership policy dr marvin g schorr  was voted not to be reelected last year by stockholders and was added as a fully compensated nonvoting emeritus director by the board david steadman  refused to serve on the company slate last year due to a dispute with fellow director walter m schenker mr steadman became a fully compensated nonvoting emeritus director william j ketelhut  served as head of the audit committee of the board when material weakness over internal controls failures became an issue in q  mr ketelhuts only other public board experience is serving for energy conversion devices inc which filed for bankruptcy relief after large losses during his tenure for clarity  voting the gold proxy will have no impact on the directorships of ceo matthew boyle glenn j angiolillo walter m schenker and paul o stump the statusquo directors led by recently installed chairman matthew goldfarb have made the conscious decision to adopt scorched earth tactics specifically matt goldfarb has personalized this proxy contest by trying to bully mr morris with threats to tarnish his reputation and harm his ability to work in the investment industry making outlandish demands that mr morris withdraw his superb nominees and agree to a nonmarket threeyear standstill just to hold on to his directorship even though stockholders like you already elected mr morris to serve until  stonewalling mr morris multiple good faith attempts to settle and avoid this costly illconsidered proxy contest that matt goldfarb and the statusquo directors have foisted upon you running roughshod over normal board conduct by squelching open discussion and prohibiting mr morris and even some of the statusquo directors from speaking making us at times question whether this a board or a dictatorship interfering with mr morris right to information by imposing newly invented hurdles that apply to no other director yet mr goldfarb and the other statusquo directors want you to believe that they are qualified and motivated to have their hands on the wheel at this transformational moment in sevcons history meson believes that this pattern of disturbingly aggressive conduct is a window into their true motivation and ask you the real owners of sevcon to draw your own conclusions we believe mesons noncontrol slate is better suited to deliver the brighter future for sevcon that you so richly deserve we ask you to vote for a better future at sevcon the future is now opportunities are there for the taking in the electric car industry and meson offers to you a noncontrol slate of directors qualified and committed to overseeing our detailed plans to vault sevcon to a pole position in the ev space the choice is yours we ask you to embrace our vision by signing and returning the gold proxy card today time is critical  the company

print friendly share source meson capital partners llc december    et meson capital partners  shareholder nominates highly qualified board of director candidates for sevcon annual meeting change at the top is required to unlock sevcons potential in an accelerating market for electrification san francisco camarketwired  december    meson capital partners llc meson a major shareholder of sevcon inc nasdaq sev sevcon or the company with approximately  of the companys outstanding shares today announced it is nominating  highly qualified candidates for election to sevcons board of directors at the  annual meeting scheduled for february   in order to reserve its rights to run a short or majority slate for the upcoming meetingryan j morris cfa president of meson and a current director of sevcon today delivered the following open letter to sevcon directors and shareholders highlighting his belief thatsevcon is uniquely positioned to benefit from the global shift towards electrification of mobility and autos as the market grows exponentiallytime is of the essence there is a window of opportunity to capture market share that will close within  years if not approached thoughtfully and decisivelythe current board oversees sevcons underperformance and yet refuses to embrace the need for changemesons highly qualified candidates have successful track records in businesses highly relevant to sevcons current situationdecember  from ryan j morris cfa president meson capital partners llc  sevcon directordear fellow board members and shareholdersi am writing to you today to express my belief that sevcon is uniquely positioned to benefit from the global transition to electrification of motion and away from fossil fuels never before in the companys long history has an opportunity of this magnitude presented itself the rapidly declining cost of lithiumion batteries and tightening emissions standards are causing explosive growth in the market for electric and hybrid drivetrainssevcon has a proven unique ability to engineer the critical and highly challenging power electronics designs required to enable electrification of a wide variety of applications if the company is to take advantage of the current market acceleration and maintain a strong position it must scale this capability rapidly this is a new challenge the company has never faced before and in our opinion is incapable of tackling today without improvements to the boardthe board must agree on and implement a vision for the company to determine how we want to embrace this opportunity we can eithermaintain the status quo of slow to no growth and modest profitability by resisting change and reacting to immediate customer requests orseize the opportunity and shift to a more entrepreneurial growthoriented modelit is not responsible for this board to choose option a above the stakes are too high and opportunity is much too great shareholders employees and our customers deserve more from the board and deserve it without delayto date i have worked hard in collaboration with senior executives of sevcon and other outside industry experts and entrepreneurs to create and put forth a plan to rapidly grow the company once the engineering design window begins to close market share could be determined for decades to come by virtue of the long product lifecycles and high switching costs rapid change is being imposed on our company by the market this reality demands a thoughtful and decisive response that the current board is not deliveringunfortunately despite many attempts to be collaborative  including this mondays meeting where you rejected a reasonable settlement to avoid the necessity of meson formally nominating our highly qualified director candidates  it has proven impossible to drive change in the boardroom internallywe should no longer be willing to focus on preserving the current state of affairs and associated slow organic growth and unacceptable shareholder returns we must introduce new directors who have relevant successful track records entrepreneurial energy and experience navigating changing markets with these new members our responsibility will be to formulate and implement a comprehensive plan to exploit this market opportunity the tone starts at the top the current board does not have the interest or the capabilities necessary to guide and oversee sevcon safely and profitably through this time of great change and opportunityaccordingly we have nominated six highly qualified director candidates who shareholders will have the opportunity to select to represent their interests at the upcoming annual meeting on february   this action reserves our full rights to run a short or majority slate at the upcoming annual meetinghighlights of our highly qualified and independent nomineestony posawatz led the innovative chevy volt program at gm and has  years of auto industry connections in evs and chargingshvet jain is a serial founder and
