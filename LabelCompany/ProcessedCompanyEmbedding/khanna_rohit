when evaluating bb integration platforms  network products guide   get your it world awards entry kit now network products guide is published from silicon valley in the united states of america home executive briefings industry updates it directory it world awards volunteer as expert register awards about npg past svus awards® winners include features cios should look for when evaluating bb integration platforms seeburger is a market leader in businesstobusiness integration with more than  years of experience and over  satisfied customers around the globe including many of the world’s largest companies the seeburger business integration suite functions as a central platform and data hub for all business processes with external partners as well as for file sharing both inside and outside the corporate firewall providing the industryfirst ability to manage both structured and unstructured data exchange with one solution and merge all logs in a single view seeburger solutions are available in installed managed service and cloudbased deployment models san madan what is the problem with legacy bb infrastructures what benefits do it departments gain with bb modernization rohit khanna legacy bb infrastructures have been cobbled together over the years to accommodate new protocols trading partners or corporate entities added after mergers and acquisitions the result is a tangle of disparate components – including multiple gateways adapters plugins and ftp and sftp servers – that is expensive to manage and lacks a centralized audit trail to facilitate regulatory compliance risk management and customer service this jumble of technologies is also missing modern services such as large file exchange easy supply chain monitoring within erp systems and tools for vital functions ranging from easily onboarding new trading partners to expediting customer problem resolution not being able to quickly locate a purchase order that has been held because of missing data for example can harm trading partner relationships newer bb integration systems reduce it overhead by consolidating multiple components into a single package they typically also add modern features such as checkpointrestart for increased security draganddrop process changes that minimize coding automated error notification that avoids delays in learning about problems such as transmission failures and the option to deploy the bb platform in the cloud or as a managed service advanced systems also add pointandclick message traceability managed file transfer and other features that improve visibility security governance compliance andor customer service about rohit khanna rohit khanna is evp global strategy and corporate development seeburger he plays a key advisory role in seeburger product strategy is a member of the company’s executive management board and has more than two decades of experience in businesstobusiness integration and infrastructure management since joining seeburger he has helped extend the company’s core business integration platform into new vertical markets expand its secure managed file transfer capabilities and leverage seeburger’s  years of business integration leadership to help customers further streamline business processes reduce operational costs facilitate governance and compliance and provide visibility to the farthest edges of the supply chain san madan what is the advantage of integrating edibb and mft technologies in one platform rohit khanna managed file transfer mft is a secure and centrally managed alternative to exchanging large andor sensitive files by ftp or consumer file sharing services mft technology creates a central hub for data transfers encrypts shared files at the point of origin enforces corporate policies on who can send what to whom provides an audit trail of all file sharing activities for compliance and forensics purposes and offers other protections required in today’s business environment if the mft platform is not integrated into the edibb system that handles trading partner communications however businesses must deploy and manage two separate bb infrastructures a conventional bb system that manages the exchange of structured documents such as pos and invoices and an mft system to handle the exchange of unstructured documents such as pdf orders cad drawings and payroll data sent from one it system to another bb integration platforms with builtin mft services make that second infrastructure unnecessary reducing the total cost of ownership while also eliminating the need for it staff to learn multiple tools in addition systems that merge both structured and unstructured file exchange activity in a single audit trail provide a ‘single source of truth’ this streamlines corporate and regulatory compliance efforts by eliminating a hunt through multiple systems to track down an errant file or reconstruct the path of a security breach san madan what features should cios look for when evaluating bb integration platforms rohit khanna there is a long list but here are a few to start first be sure the platform supports the data formats and protocols your organization requires second check to see if it supports those needs out of the box or if additional work is required third find out if it’s equally capable of handling both transactional and unstructured data so that you can manage edibb and mft functions in the same system fourth see if it is possible to automate your business processes through a workflow engine – and if so whether the engine is based on proprietary technology or on open standards such as bpel that will make it easier for your staff to learn fifth determine whether the various components have been developed internally or whether they are plugins acquired from different companies that will have a direct impact on the level of integration which in turn will dictate how much overhead is required for both it staff and end users to access information also be sure to ask questions that will allow you to gauge the vendor’s commitment to the platform what is the development roadmap for the product be cautious about companies that have not invested significantly in their solutions for three to five years what percentage of revenue is put back into the product less than  is below industry benchmarks and should cause concern company seeburger  peachtree street ne atlanta ga usa founded in  ceo bernd seeburger public or private private head office in country germany products and services
