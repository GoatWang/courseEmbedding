villanova university school of law jd  family married susan maiden name unknown career bracewell  patterson – lawyer southdown – ceo and president centex corporation – president and coo – ceo and president – chairman and ceo centex construction products – chairman eagle materials – chairman address eagle materials  turtle creek boulevard suite  dallas texas  httpwwweaglematerialscom ■ laurence e hirsch joined centex corporation in  and eventually became ceo and chairman of the company during his tenure there hirsch helped build the company into the nations largest homeconstruction business before diversifying into smaller businesses ranging from cement to pest control which he did partly in order to offset the impact of the cyclical nature of home building on the companys bottom line after retiring from centex in  hirsch continued his role as chairman of centex construction products which was renamed eagle materials analysts credited hirschs strategy of extending the reach of both his company and his management power with being a vital key to centexs success from courtroom to business meetings hirsch was born in new york city and attended the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania where he majored in industrial relations and met his wife susan although he was interested in business he did not stay on at wharton in order to earn his mba instead deciding to attend law school at villanova university in an article by david a stevenson that appeared on the web site of the wharton club of dallasfort worth hirsh was quoted as commenting i wanted to broaden my education my wifes father was a lawyer in philadelphia and i saw him as a role model february   after graduating from law school in  hirsch spent a year in the us army reserves before joining an established philadelphia law firm where he stayed for a year while doing work for one of the firms clients in houston texas hirsch was recommended by the client to the smaller dallas firm of bracewell  patterson which subsequently recruited him seeing the job offer as an opportunity to become involved in more diverse activities hirsch accepted the position and practiced law with bracewell  patterson for about two years as a part of one of his cases at bracewell  patterson hirsch became involved with southdown he was representing a family from new york that was mired in a proxy fight for control of the company the family eventually obtained three seats on the board and later proposed its own slate of directors having helped the family assume control of southdown hirsch approached the yearold family head and asked for the opportunity to run the company the family head complied at the age of  hirsch became ceo of a conglomerate that owned oil and gas properties a cement operation and a brewery and bottling operations hirsch stayed at southdown until  when he was recruited by centex success at centex hirschs career at centex was characterized by exceptional results he started out as president and coo in  became ceo in  and added the title of chairman of the board in  over the course of his career at centex hirsch helped oversee an increase in the companys revenues from  billion in  to more than  billion in fiscal  although hirsch had helped centex become the nations largest home builder in  the company still had less than  percent of the national market share in addition hirsch realized that the company was dependent almost solely on the newhome market and was thus highly vulnerable to general economic fluctuations the companys profits had lurched from  in  to  million in  yet even when centexs bottom line seemed unstable hirsch remained optimistic that the company could grow and so he oversaw its expansion into new markets around  he started to slow down centexs emphasis on home building starting fewer projects in suburban subdivisions centex had diversified into the manufacture of cement and wallboard when hirsch joined the company in  and he wanted to diversify further while researching possible directions in which to lead the company hirsch found that mobile homes accounted for nearly onethird of all new homes sold in the mids he decided to plunge into that market in  he bought  percent of cavco industries which was the numberone mobilehome maker in arizona he also bought a small mobilehome retailer and started up one business that financed mobile homes and another that built trailer parks by the end of fiscal  hirschs decisions had paid off that year centexs mobilehome operations earned around  million up from the  million of three years before hirschs efforts at diversification also included investment in pest control the company installed porous plastic pipes in the walls of its new homes then sold pestcontrol services in which a centex employee used the pipes to fumigate the house every three months in many communities up to  percent of home buyers signed up for the services leading to more than  pestcontrol customers in  and  million in revenues all in all hirsch led centexs nonhomebuilding businesses to account for  percent of the companys sales and  percent of its operating profits in  many analysts credited his expansion tactics with helping the company to remain strong through a subsequent falloff in home building although hirschs strategy of keeping newhome sales flat at around  units a year allowed another company to gain the marketleading position in the homebuilding industry centex nevertheless became the top home builder on the  forbes list of platinum companies with an average fiveyear return on capital of  percent keeps company on course by  hirsch had directed centexs initiation of an international homebuilding operation that functioned primarily in the united kingdom and mexico he also started a subprime lending operation and continued to spur growth in the companys homeservices businesses which grew to include security and lawn and garden fertilization as well as pest control overall the companys stock went from  to  a share between  and  meanwhile hirsch had kept home sales increasing at a rate of  percent over the years and analysts credited him with helping the company leverage costs thus boosting net income by  percent still many analysts were questioning centexs and other construction companies ability to continue to grow as worries about the stability of the economy heightened hirsch remained confident that he could keep all of centexs gears running smoothly in spite of the signs that the economy was entering a slump while centex had fallen to the numberfour position in the us homebuilding industry an alysts remained bullish largely because of hirschs diversification strategies they noted that the dallasbased company was extremely strong in construction contracts in states such as texas and florida and they also emphasized the companys strength in not being entirely reliant on the cyclical construction business for profits in  onethird of centexs profits came from homebuilding services such as home finance and pest control by cutting back on newhome construction hir sch had ensured that the company would retain a low inventory of unsold homes hirsch also established a mortgage unit called ctx mort gage that played solidly into the firms strategy for increasing income in an interview with national mortgage news  hirsch noted ctx mortgage will add about  million to the companys earnings this year december   on april   hirsch boasted of a truly spectacular quarter in terms of finances in which centexs revenues increased  percent to over  billion management style diversify and delegate analysts noted that hirschs emphasis on diversification in the s helped make centex one of the most successful building companies in the nation they observed that part of his management style was also to spread out his management power for example he redesigned the companys home building operations so that they were split into  profit centers each run by a local president these presidents took complete responsibility for regional aspects of the businesses—aspects that were typically overseen at headquarters at other large building companies—such as the purchasing of land and construction materials and the contracting of services analysts noted that this approach provided real incentive for regional presidents to turn large profits as their salaries could be doubled or tripled as a result of their performances with respect to his personal philosophy on business leadership hirsch maintained that there was no single best approach he once noted that leadershipdevelopment professionals often said that their specific practices could be applied at any firm hirsch however maintained a more independent view of leadership as quoted in the book leading the way three truths from the top companies for leaders  by robert gondossy and marc effron hirsch noted lets take that best practice and really think how it fits our people and what the needs of our people are we need to centexize it  steps down from centex although hirsch had outlined many plans for centexs future the company suddenly announced in early  that he was retiring as ceo and chairman some analysts were surprised at his resignation which became effective march   arthur odama of morningstar told the miami herald  this appears to be an unexpected change at the top january   although he was no longer centexs chairman and ceo hirsch continued to serve as the chairman of the separate company centex construction products which was renamed eagle materials after it was spun off from centex corporation eagles businesses included readymixed aggregate and cement operations in texas nevada california and illinois during his career hirsch was also a member of the boards of directors of luminex corporation and belos corporation an advisory director of heidelberger cement and a trustee of the university of pennsylvania see also
