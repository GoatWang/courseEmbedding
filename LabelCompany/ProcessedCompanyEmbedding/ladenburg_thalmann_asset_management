coordination bsc throughout the latters existence soe in london was tasked by hm treasury in july  as the lead british agency for the acquisition of foreign currency required in small denominations by members of the plethora of british covert wartime agencies as well as the escape packs of allied aircrew soe turned to bsc for help with this task the very close links between bsc and the oss meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the contraband control bases such as bermuda gibraltar and aden or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships another source were the black markets in tangiers beirut istanbul and elsewhere by the sale of commodities such as gold platinum diamonds precious stones and swiss watches most of these items in short supply because of the allied blockade and restrictions on movement could be acquired by british government supply departments from within the british empire using sterling as the purchasing currency virtually every european currency was acquired as well as south american and far eastern currencies a statement from mid prepared for winston churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being m french francs m belgian francs m dutch guilders m norwegian kroner m danish kroner m reichsmarks m spanish pesetas m us dollars and m argentine pesos excluding the us dollars and argentine pesos the balance had cost the british treasury around £m a major problem that both soe and bsc had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes a number of surviving signals in soe files at national archives in kew mention tons of bank notes there is no doubt that contraband seizures by allied blockade authorities were recycled to support wartime covert activity mussons smuggling fleet which operated from gibraltar carrying soe and sis agents to and from

for lpl and commonwealth to reveal their strategy on automated digital financial advice another brokerdealer’s robo is now ready for the market ladenburg thalmann financial services launched ymbil a selfservice investment platform that automatically matches clients up with a ladenburg investment model based on their risk tolerance ymbil only requires a minimum investment of  philip blancato the chief executive officer of ladenburg thalmann asset management which manages the five portfolio models ymbil uses said the product is directtoconsumer and new clients can fund an account directly through the ymbil website but instead of competing with other retail robo services like wealthfront betterment or schwab institutional portfolios blancato sees most of ymbil’s business coming from ladenburgaffiliated advisors looking to use the service to connect with their current clients’ children and techsavvy boomers “if advisors have a millennial client that would prefer to enroll in a digital advice platform they now have that opportunity” blancato said though ymbil doesn’t currently have a whitelabel offering for advisors blancato said the firm is open to providing one in the future if advisors demand it but “we felt like the way we could build an effective digital advisor would be something that compliments what we already have” that “something” is ladenburg’s year history of working with advisors making it a brand advisors know and trust more than a technology startup as well as the company’s philosophy of active portfolio management blancato said so although an algorithm will automatically allocate a client’s assets to a specific model portfolio those models will be reviewed and altered by a team of human investment managers “we don’t believe in passive management” blancato said adding that it plans to tweak the five allocation models its robo uses as many as eight times in a year “we believe tactically adjusting a portfolio will drive higher returns and reduce volatility over the long term” in a statement blancato said the robo’s portfolios will be managed by a “seasoned investment team that employs strategic asset allocation and tactical decisions to capitalize on market conditions and unique investment opportunities” like with a whitelabel offering ladenburg would consider offering more than five strategies in the future and adjusting how it approaches assigning them to clients blancato said this is very much a “version ” of ymbil and plans for the product to evolve based on advisor feedback timothy welsh the president at nexus strategy said it’s interesting that a robo is finally coming into the independent brokerdealer space a sector welsh said is slower to adopt technology for fear of cutting out their own reps “with the new dol fiduciary standard they will need to have a lowcost option for retirement accounts and this will position ladenburg ahead of the pack when it comes time to comply” welsh said referring to the department of labor’s seemingly imminent rule imposing a “best interest” standard on all advisors to retirement accounts which some argue will drive up the cost of advice for clients with smaller accounts “it also gives ladenburg a scalable platform that they can use to drive efficiencies and better enable their reps to charge directly for financial planning advice” joel bruckenstein the founder of the t conferences doubted that ymbil would fly under finra’s recent guidelines on digital advice bruckenstein said even when he gave conflicting answers on the risk tolerance questionnaire indicating high risk but only tolerating a loss of  percent the robo still recommended a growth portfolio  he also raised doubts about ymbil only offering ladenburg funds and the high costs  “i did not see which class of shares users of this service are invested in but assuming even people with the minimum investment get the lowestcost shares the expenses seem high to me” bruckenstein said according to ladenburg retail investors only pay for the underlying expenses of the fund which are netted out of performance the annual fee on operating expenses is  percent including the  percent management fee and  percent in underlying etf expenses there is no cost for advisors offering ymbil to clients  this number is nowhere to be found on ymbils website instead directing customers to the prospectus where a note on page  states that internal expenses to cover fixed costs of the funds are capped at  percent  “seems like a lot for a little bit of asset allocation guidance you can get essentially the same thing from a lot of other firms for a fraction of the cost” bruckenstein said even if the fee was only  percent  adam malamed chief operating officer at ladenburg emphasized that ymbil is not intended to replace advisors but rather to be a tool to complement their traditional services and though he thinks ladenburg’s firstmover advantage in the robo market—at least among other bds—is proof of the firm’s ability to remain on the cutting edge of advisor technology the company built ymbil with a longterm game plan in mind “i hear a lot of industry buzzwords about our competitor firms that are trying to build out their own capabilities” malamed said “everybody in the industry sees a longterm opportunity i use the words ‘long term’ understanding that we built this for advisors… not for the next six to  months this is something we’re looking at for five to  years” advisors affiliated with ladenburg can access ymbil

government ladenburg thalmann provided banking services for british security coordination bsc throughout the latters existence soe in london was tasked by hm treasury in july  as the lead british agency for the acquisition of foreign currency required in small denominations by members of the plethora of british covert wartime agencies as well as the escape packs of allied aircrew soe turned to bsc for help with this task the very close links between bsc and the oss meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the contraband control bases such as bermuda gibraltar and aden or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships another source were the black markets in tangiers beirut istanbul and elsewhere by the sale of commodities such as gold platinum diamonds precious stones and swiss watches most of these items in short supply because of the allied blockade and restrictions on movement could be acquired by british government supply departments from within the british empire using sterling as the purchasing currency virtually every european currency was acquired as well as south american and far eastern currencies a statement from mid prepared for winston churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being m french francs m belgian francs m dutch guilders m norwegian kroner m danish kroner m reichsmarks m spanish pesetas m us dollars and m argentine pesos excluding the us dollars and argentine pesos the balance had cost the british treasury around £m a major problem that both soe and bsc had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes a number of surviving signals in soe files at national archives in kew mention tons of bank notes there is no doubt that contraband seizures by allied blockade authorities were recycled to support wartime covert activity mussons smuggling fleet which operated from gibraltar carrying soe and sis agents to and from spanish soil covered its tracks with a smuggling operation based initially on selling tobacco seized from blockaderunning merchant
