recent quotes from research analysts about csx corporation stock  according to zacks investment research shares of csx corporation have performed well in the last one year gaining  the company has outperformed the industry it belongs to as well as fellow railroad operator union pacific in the period while the industry witnessed a gain of  union pacific shares have rallied  ushering in further good news csx reported betterthanexpected earnings per share and revenues in the second quarter of  the company witnessed growth across nearly all markets which can be attributed to coalrelated gains strength in core pricing and volume across markets and increased fuel recovery in fact its efforts to control costs also raise optimism in the stock however the company’s thirdquarter outlook on its automotive unit raises concerns going forward sluggish auto production is likely to hurt results the weak crude oil scenario is also remains a major concern   td securities analysts commented we believe csx is poised for a period of accelerated earnings growth under mr harrison which will likely attract a premium valuation multiple while the trajectory of the coal business is a risk to our thesis we note that our forecast does not factor in the potential for substantial us   stifel nicolaus analysts commented hunter harrison is in as ceo of csx effective immediately we expect that this is a commitment to significant or improvement over the coming investment horizon hunter is quoted as saying the team will implement precision scheduled railroading a technique used to great success at cp in recent years this comes shortly after csx announced a commitment for  million in management head count reduction   cowen and company analysts commented in a much expected announcement csx corporation named hunter harrison as chief executive officer replacing the retiring michael ward who will remain as a consultant the company also reached an agreement with activist investor mantle ridge which gives them five new seats including mr harrison and mantle ridge founder paul hilal on board of directors with three incumbent board members announcing their intent to resign their positions at the end of the year the board will have  members now with current director edward kelly iii becoming chairman and paul hilal vice chairman while csx was already in the process of laying offcutting  people from its management ranks we fully expect that mr harrison will push that number higher and also cut into the rank and file headcount by reducingcombing yards and shops it is also expected that the company will now focus on faster growing areas of its network which could lead to some shedding of lines mr harrisons proverbial playbook of cutting fat and running a scheduled railroad may not seem complicated but his methods are time tested and we fully expect him to easily exceed the companys previous long term or target of  over the next few years our previous estimates are currently under review   deutsche bank ag analysts commented mantle ridge will receive about  of total board seats equating to  appointees including hilal and hunter out of  total seats which gives effect for former ceo mike wards retirement and rolloff of  incumbent board members at the next annual general meeting sometime in the next  months chairman of audit and finance committees and one regular board member there does not appear to be any standstill agreement which likely allows mantle ridge to continue pressing for change if need be interestingly csx has not agreed to hunter harrisons makewhole payment choosing instead of put it up for shareholder vote at the annual general meeting which we think should easily pass we believe hunter harrison has an effective insurance policy on this payment with mantle ridge creating some risk if shareholders dont agree though we think there is very little probability of that happening  are investors shorting csx corporation csx
