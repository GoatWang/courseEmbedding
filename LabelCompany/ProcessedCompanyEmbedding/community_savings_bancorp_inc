are described below   residential real estate and home equity lines of credit   residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are secured by oneto fourfamily residences and are comprised of owneroccupied and nonowneroccupied loans construction real estate loans immaterial for the periods presented are usually based upon estimates of costs and estimated value of the completed project and include independent appraisal reviews and a financial analysis of the developers and property owners sources of repayment of these loans may include permanent loans sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the company until permanent financing is obtained the company generally establishes a maximum loantovalue ratio and requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels repayment can also be impacted by changes in property values or residential properties risk is mitigated by the fact that loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers      table of contents     community savings bancorp inc notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited   multifamily residential real estate   multifamily real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than oneto four family residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances this increased credit risk is a result of several factors including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers the effects of general economic conditions on incomeproducing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans furthermore the repayment of loans secured by multifamily real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate property if the cash flow from the project is reduced the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired   commercial real estate   commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy the characteristics of properties securing the company’s real estate portfolio are diverse but with geographic location almost entirely in the company’s market area management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria in general the company avoids financing single purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk   consumer loans   consumer loans entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly such as automobiles in such cases repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower in particular amounts realizable on the sale of repossessed automobiles may be significantly reduced based upon the condition of the automobiles and the lack of demand for used automobiles      table of contents     community savings bancorp inc notes to condensed

conversion and issuing the capital stock totaled  million and was deducted from the proceeds of the offering   in accordance with occ regulations at the time of the conversion the bank substantially restricted retained earnings by establishing a liquidation account  the liquidation account will be maintained for the benefit of eligible holders who continue to maintain their accounts at the bank after the conversion  the liquidation account will be reduced annually to the extent that eligible account holders have reduced their qualifying deposits subsequent increases will not restore an eligible account holder’s interest in the liquidation account  in the event of a complete liquidation of the bank and only in such event each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account in an amount proportionate to the adjusted qualifying account balances then held  the bank may not pay dividends if those dividends would reduce equity

understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in part i item  of this quarterly report on form q   forwardlooking statements   this document contains forwardlooking statements which can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate” “project” “believe” “intend” “anticipate” “plan” “seek” “expect” and similar expressions these forwardlooking statements include statements of goals intentions and expectations statements regarding prospects and business strategy statements regarding asset quality and market risk and estimates of future costs benefits and results   these forwardlooking statements are subject to significant risks assumptions and uncertainties including among other things the following  general economic conditions  competitive pressure among financial services companies  changes in interest rates  deposit flows  loan demand  changes in legislation or regulation  changes in accounting principles policies and guidelines and  other economic competitive governmental regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations pricing products and services   because of these and other uncertainties our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forwardlooking statements we have no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements to reflect any changed assumptions any unanticipated events or any changes in the future   critical accounting policies   the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies the estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations   the jumpstart our business startups act of  the “jobs act” contains provisions that among other things reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies as an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies we intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period accordingly our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards      table of contents     community savings bancorp inc item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following represent our critical accounting policies   allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent but unconfirmed credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income in determining the allowance for loan losses management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies   management performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including but not limited to current economic conditions delinquency statistics geographic and industry concentrations the adequacy of the underlying collateral the financial strength of the borrower results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change   the analysis has two components specific and general allowances the specific percentage allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or for collateraldependent loans the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses if the fair value of the loan is less than the loan’s carrying value a charge is recorded for the difference the general allowance which is for loans reviewed collectively is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan risk weighting if applicable and payment history we also analyze historical loss experience delinquency trends general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations this analysis establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively the qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results   deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets which are inherently subjective are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change determining the proper valuation allowance for deferred taxes is critical in properly valuing the deferred tax asset and the related recognition of income tax expense or benefit any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets      table of contents     community savings bancorp inc item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   fair value measurements  the fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale the company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices quoted market prices are used for fair value when the financial instruments are not actively traded other observable market inputs such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics may be used if available to determine fair value when observable market prices do not exist the company estimates fair value these estimates are subjective in nature and imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded a more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by the company can be found in
