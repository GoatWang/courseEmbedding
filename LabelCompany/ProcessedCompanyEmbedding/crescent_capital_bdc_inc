including senior secured unitranche and second lien debt and unsecured debt including senior unsecured and subordinated debt as well as related equity securities of private us lowermiddlemarket companies ccfg is focused on companies with annual earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda of less than  million these companies typically are highly leveraged and in

“potential coinvestment transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a regulated entity or its whollyowned investment subsidiary seeks to participate together with one or more other regulated entities andor affiliated funds in reliance on the order  applicants state that a regulated entity may from time to time form a whollyowned investment subsidiary such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a coinvestment transaction with any other regulated entity or affiliated fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent regulated entity for purposes of section a and rule d applicants request that each whollyowned investment subsidiary be permitted to participate in coinvestment transactions in lieu of its parent regulated entity and that the whollyowned investment subsidiarys participation in any such transaction be treated for purposes of the order as though the parent regulated entity were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment subsidiary would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated entitys investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the regulated entity and the whollyowned investment subsidiary the regulated entitys board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subsidiarys participation in a coinvestment transaction and the regulated entitys board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment subsidiary in the regulated entitys place if the regulated entity proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment

“required majority”  will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated entity  with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated entity may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated entity and each affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of the regulated entity has approved that regulated entitys participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated entity if the board does not so approve any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated entitys eligible directors the board of any regulated

and approve any such independent third party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the regulated entitys shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant
