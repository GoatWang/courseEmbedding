funds mutual funds stocks investing strategies bonds exchangetraded funds mutual funds stocks investing strategies bonds exchangetraded funds mutual funds stocks there are two moments when checking on the value of your investments may be almost irresistible when your balance is soaring—and when it is tanking but that’s just when emotions have a nasty way of clouding the minds of even the most seasoned investors it is better to give your portfolio a regular checkup at the very least you should check your asset allocation once a year or any time your financial circumstances change significantly—for instance if you lose your job or get a big bonus your checkup is a good time to determine if you need to rebalance your asset mix or reconsider some of your specific investments we believe that setting and maintaining your strategic asset allocation are among the most important ingredients in your longterm investment success no matter what your age or goals we believe this means being diversified both among and within different types of stocks bonds and other investments why diversify the goal of diversification is not necessarily to boost performance—it won’t ensure gains or guarantee against losses but once you choose to target a level of risk based on your goals time horizon and tolerance for volatility diversification may provide the potential to improve returns for that level of risk to build a diversified portfolio you should look for assets—stocks bonds cash or others—whose returns haven’t historically moved in the same direction and to the same degree and ideally assets whose returns typically move in opposite directions this way even if a portion of your portfolio is declining the rest of your portfolio hopefully is growing thus you can potentially offset some of the impact of a poorly performing asset class on your overall portfolio another important aspect of building a welldiversified portfolio is that you try to stay diversified within each type of investment within your individual stock holdings beware of overconcentration in a single stock for example you may not want one stock to make up more than  of your stock portfolio fidelity also believes it’s smart to diversify across stocks by market capitalization small mid and large caps sectors and geography again not all caps sectors and regions have prospered at the same time or to the same degree so you may be able to reduce portfolio risk by spreading your assets across different parts of the stock market you may want to consider a mix of styles too such as growth and value similarly when it comes to your bond investments consider varying maturities credit qualities and durations which measure sensitivity to interestrate changes diversification has proven its longterm value during the – bear market many different types of investments lost value to some degree at the same time while it may have felt as though diversification failed during the downturn it didn’t the major asset classes were more highly correlated but diversification still helped contain portfolio losses consider the performance of three hypothetical portfolios a diversified portfolio of  stocks  bonds and  shortterm investments a  stock portfolio and an allcash portfolio diversification helped limit losses and capture gains during the  financial crisis source strategic advisers inc hypothetical value of assets held in untaxed accounts of  in an all cash portfolio a diversified growth portfolio of  us stocks  international stocks  bonds and  shortterm investments and all stockportfolio of  us stocks and  international stocks this chart’s hypothetical illustration uses historical monthly performance from january  through february  from morningstaribbotson associates stocks are represented by the sp  and msci eafe indexes bonds are represented by the barclays us intermediate government treasury bond index and shortterm investments are represented by us day tbills chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of any investment past performance is no guarantee of future results by the end of february  both the allstock and the diversified portfolios would have declined the allstock portfolio would have lost nearly half of its initial value – however the diversified portfolio would have lost a bit more than a third  yes the diversified portfolio would have declined but diversification would have helped reduce losses compared with the allstock portfolio the allcash portfolio  would have outperformed the allstock and diversified portfolios over this month period investors have averaged lower returns than some market indexes january  – december  source quantitative analysis of investor behavior qaib  dalbar inc wwwdalbarcom average equity fund investor and average bond fund investor performances were  from the dalbar study qaib  see the footnote dalbar study below for important information watching the value of a stock or diversified portfolio fall that much is just the kind of situation that can stir an investor’s emotions—and sometimes lead to shortterm decision making including dumping your stock holdings indeed keeping your money in cash might have seemed like a good idea in february  but look at what happened as market started to come back five years after the bottom our hypothetical allstock portfolio would have risen by  the diversified portfolio by  and the allcash portfolio by  the allstock portfolio got the biggest lift during the market’s upswing this is a good example of how such portfolios can behave when the market is in an upward trend—the diversified portfolio may gain less than the allstock portfolio and more than the allcash portfolio now let’s look at what happened over a longer cycle from january  through february  the diversified portfolio was up   while the allstock portfolio was up  this is what diversification is about it will not maximize gains in rising markets but it captured most of the gains while delivering less volatility than just investing in stocks the high price of bad timing why is it so important to have a risk level you can live with as the example above illustrates the value of a diversified portfolio usually plays out over time unfortunately many investors struggle to realize the benefits of their investment strategy because in buoyant markets people tend to chase performance and purchase higherrisk investments in a market downturn investors tend to flock to lowerrisk investment options which can lead to missed opportunities during ensuing market recoveries the degree of underperformance by individual investors has often been the worst during bear markets studies have consistently shown that the returns achieved by the average stock or bond fund investor have lagged often by a large margin the reported returns of the average stock or bond index the data from dalbar see chart right shows that fund investors trail the market significantly this means the decisions investors make about diversification within and across asset classes and trying to time when to get into or out of the market as well as about fees or underperforming funds cause them to generate far lower returns than the overall market “being disciplined as an investor isn’t always easy but over time it has demonstrated the ability to generate wealth while market timing has proven to be a costly exercise for many investors” observes an executive vice president at fidelity investments “having a plan that includes appropriate asset allocation and regular rebalancing can help investors overcome this challenge” building a diversified portfolio to start you need to make sure your asset mix eg stocks bonds and shortterm investments is aligned to your investment time frame financial needs and comfort with volatility the sample asset mixes below combine various amounts of stock bond and shortterm investments to illustrate different levels of risk and return potential choose the amount of stocks you are comfortable with data source morningstar inc  – past performance is no guarantee of future results returns include the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings this chart is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual or implied performance of any investment option see footnote two below for detailed information the purpose of the target asset mixes is to show how target asset mixes may be created with different risk and return characteristics to help meet a participants goals you should choose your own investments based on your particular objectives and situation remember you may change how your account is invested be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals diversification is not a onetime task once you have a target mix you need to keep it on track with periodic checkups and rebalancing if you don’t rebalance a good run in stocks could leave your portfolio with a risk level that is inconsistent with your goal and strategy how an investment mix can change over time this charts hypothetical illustration uses historical monthly performance from january  through december  from morningstaribbotson associates stocks are represented by the sp  and msci eafe indexes bonds are represented by barclays us intermediate government treasury bond index and shortterm investments are represented by us day tbills chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of any investment past performance is no guarantee of future results what if you don’t rebalance let’s look at a hypothetical portfolio over a historical year period to illustrate how changing markets such as last year’s large rise in the sp  can have an impact on an investment mix—and in turn on the amount of risk in a portfolio consider a hypothetical growth portfolio with  in stocks  us and  foreign  bonds and  shortterm investments in january  two decades later at the end of december  the investment mix has changed dramatically—to  in stocks  us and  foreign  in bonds and  short term see the chart right the resulting increased weight in stocks both domestic and foreign meant the portfolio now had more potential risk why because while past performance does not guarantee future results stocks have historically had larger price swings than bonds or cash this means that when a portfolio skews toward stocks the portfolio has the potential for bigger ups and downs in fact as the chart below shows the portfolio’s risk level as of december  was nearly  greater than that of the target mix due to changes in the asset allocation associated with the relative returns to stocks bonds and cash the standard deviation eg risk was  for the rebalanced portfolio and  for the buy and hold portfolio portfolio risk is measured by the annualized standard deviation of monthly returns which shows the variability of a portfolio’s returns let’s take a closer look at the risk levels of the hypothetical portfolio over time the chart below shows the hypothetical portfolio’s risk for two scenarios if the investment mix were rebalanced back to the target every year and if no rebalancing ever took place—in other words a buy and hold strategy as you can see the risk of the buyandhold portfolio varied more widely than that of the rebalanced portfolio on average during this time period the buyandhold portfolio experienced higher risk annualized portfolio volatility rebalancing is not just a riskreducing exercise the goal is to reset your asset mix to bring it back to the expected and appropriate risk level for you sometimes that means reducing risk by increasing the portion of a portfolio in more conservative options but sometimes it means adding more risk to get back to your target mix that could mean increasing investments in riskier asset classes such as stocks investing is an ongoing process you need to create a plan choose appropriate investments and then conduct regular checkups to keep your portfolio on track here are the three steps to do just that  know your target investment mix if you haven’t already done so choose a mix of stocks bonds and shortterm investments that you consider appropriate for your investing goals take into account your financial situation tolerance for volatility and when you will need the money you are investing not rebalancing led to more risk over time january december  chart is for illustrative purposes only the chart depicts observed historical risk based on the performance of broad diversified indexes named in the chart “how an investment mix can change over time” a portfolio that is not diversified within asset classes may experience different levels of risk stocks have historically had higher potential for growth and longer time periods can help to smooth out volatility on the other hand if you’ll need the money in just a few years—or if the thought of potentially losing money makes you too nervous—consider a higher allocation to generally less volatile investments such as bonds and shortterm investments by doing this of course you’d be trading the potential of higher returns for the potential of lower volatility  review your portfolio regularly we suggest you—on your own or in partnership with an investment professional—monitor your asset mix at least annually or whenever your financial circumstances change and rebalance your portfolio to correct for significant drift away from the mix you choose as a guideline you may want to consider rebalancing if your stock allocation moves away from your target by more than  percentage points  rebalancing when needed there are a variety of ways to rebalance your portfolio one is to sell those asset classes you currently have too much of and reinvest the proceeds in those that fall short of your target but selling securities in taxable accounts generally has tax consequences in the year of a sale so be sure to consider taxes when making any decisions to sell a way to rebalance without immediate tax consequences is to invest any new money you have savings contributions bonus etc either gradually or all at once in investments in asset classes that currently fall below your target regardless of which approach you take one important aspect of rebalancing is that you do it in a way that also keeps your portfolio diversified within each type of investment achieving your longterm goals requires balancing risk and reward choosing the right mix of investments and then periodically rebalancing and monitoring your choices can make a big difference in your outcome learn more get a holistic view of your retirement plan with our planning  guidance center and explore changes that may help you become
