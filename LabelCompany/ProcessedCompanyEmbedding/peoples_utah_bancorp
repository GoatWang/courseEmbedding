underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full based on the initial public offering price of  per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us we expect to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering to expand our operations through the opening of new branches acquisitions and for general corporate purposes additionally we may use a portion of the net proceeds to finance mergers or acquisitions of nonbank financial services companies although we have no present agreements or commitments to make any acquisition while our growth strategy includes opening new branches and completing strategic mergers or acquisitions and we regularly identify and explore specific acquisition opportunities as part of our ongoing business practices we have no present agreements or commitments to use any of the net proceeds from this offering for these purposes over the next twelve months however if opportunities to open new branches or complete acquisitions present themselves then we may choose to use some or all of the net proceeds to take advantage of such opportunities we currently do not intend to use any of the net proceeds we will receive from this offering to add capital to baf or lsb the amounts and timing of these expenditures will depend on numerous factors including the amount of our future revenues and net income our ability to identify attractive expansion and acquisition opportunities and the success of our marketing efforts accordingly our management will retain broad discretion in deploying the net proceeds from this offering pending the uses described above we plan to invest the net proceeds in investmentgrade availableforsale interestbearing investments the banking and financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive this increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of growth by the large national banks and credit unions changes in regulation changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers we compete for loans deposits and customers with other commercial banks local community banks savings and loan associations securities and brokerage companies mortgage companies insurance companies finance companies money market funds credit unions and other nonbank financial services providers many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer competition for deposit and loan products remains strong from both banking and nonbanking firms and this competition directly affects the rates of those products and the terms on which they are offered to customers price competition for deposits may adversely affect our ability to generate low cost core deposits in our primary market areas sufficient to fund our asset growth as a result we may seek alternative funding through borrowings and may need to price our deposit products more aggressively resulting in an increase in our costs of funding and a reduction in our net interest margin while our deposit base has increased several larger banks have grown their deposit market share in our markets faster than we have resulting in a declining relative deposit market share for us in our existing markets we believe our declining relative market share in deposits has resulted primarily from aggressive marketing and advertising branch expansion expanded delivery channels and more attractive rates offered by larger bank competitors technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets many customers now expect a choice of several delivery systems and channels including telephone mail internet banking mobile banking and atms according to snl briefing book  deposit market

market share industrial loan companies or industrial banks are financial institutions that loan money and may be owned by nonfinancial institutions for historical reasons most industrial banks are headquartered in a small number of states including utah california nevada and colorado many of the largest industrial banks are headquartered in utah however most of the utah industrial banks are owned or controlled by major industrial corporations or financial services firms based outside of utah and their deposits are primarily from customers residing outside of utah as a result we do not consider most utah industrial banks to be our competitors for deposits according to the snl report our largest competitors by county are as follows competitor’s market county largest competitor share

state of utah wells fargo  co   credit union organizations are also competitors for customer deposits in utah and have added pressure to our ability to retain and attract deposits according to the snl report total  deposits for the state of utah were approximately  billion of which credit unions held approximately  billion or  of total deposits in utah this is an increase in total credit union deposits from approximately  billion in  but a decrease in market share from  of total utah deposits in  of approximately  billion increased regulation and mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to consolidate their operations reduce expenses and increase revenues to remain competitive in addition competition has intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws which permit banking organizations to expand geographically with fewer restrictions than in the past we have been able to develop a loyal borrower and depositor base by
