rating drivers strong collateral quality  has a weighted average wa nonzero obligor fico score of  a relatively diverse mix of vehicles and undiscounted base residuals of  as a percentage of securitization value sv new leasing platform gmf began originating auto leases in december  therefore empirical data are limited fitch supplemented the gmf data with proxy data from comparable origination platforms to derive a credit loss expectation while residual value rv performance data for gm vehicles were utilized an additional residual loss haircut was employed to account for potential volatility in auction proceeds owing to the servicer concentrated lease maturities lease maturities are more concentrated in  with the highest singlemonth maturity totaling  of the base rv and peak sixmonth residual maturities totaling  of the pool both higher than  sufficient credit enhancement ce structure initial hard ce totals    and  for class a b c and d notes respectively based

wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market has been normalizing following very strong performance in recent years fitch expects that increasing offlease vehicle supply and pressure from rising production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during the life of the transaction stable corporate health fitch rates gmf bbpositive outlook fitch believes gmf to be a capable originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical performance of its managed portfolio legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of gmf would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this could result in potential rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to gm financial automobile leasing trust  to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays relatively little sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses showing downgrades between one and less than one rating category even under fitchs severe x base case loss the transaction shows more sensitivity to residual loss volatility though even under fitchs severe scenario the class a and b notes would be expected to retain an investment grade rating key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further detailed in
