multiple email addresses separated by commas message  required fields a taiwanese manufacturer for industrial rubber products is working with dimension data to upgrade its internet telephony infrastructure in order to improve efficiency and optimize collaboration between its factories in taiwan mainland china and thailand experiencing steady growth the rubber firm decided that it was strategic to invest in ipt technology with the addition of new capabilities such as web conferencing to facilitate better communication among its manufacturing centres and administrative offices however the company wanted a partner that was not only a unified communications expert but also one with proven multicountry project execution capabilities the biggest challenge was upgrading the outdated ip telephony system that the client has been using for years said frank liao general manager at dimension data taiwan with no automated migration tools available for this system our teams familiarity and expertise with ip telephony systems made it possible for us to design and implement a smooth migration plan for the client said liao dimension data assigned a dedicated project team developed a comprehensive plan with prelaunch testing and created a solution based on cisco collaboration technologies the project includes implementing cisco business edition  be an allinone endtoend collaboration solution across five sites in taiwan china and thailand aside from upgrading the ipt system the project also includes voice gateway migration server virtualisation jabber instant messaging roll out for mobile users and the development of a private cisco webex meeting centre the new ipt platform is scalable less complex and much easier to manage the use of jabber and webex enables mobility and improves collaboration as well as allowing comprehensive communications between internal colleagues external partners and customers the goal was to achieve the business results quickly increase team productivity and lower costs said liao even though the project is not fully completed the client is already seeing savings in a host of areas such as international calls and
