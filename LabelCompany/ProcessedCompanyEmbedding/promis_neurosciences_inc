promis neurosciences has developed a preclinical program that targets the root cause of the disease and also offers the potential to get in on an investment with a double bottom line says elliot goldstein ceo of promis in this interview with the life sciences report read more  eden rahim next edge capital  promis neurosciences inc is a preclinical company but it will be going in the clinic over the next year or so im in it because of some of the really important insights it has discovered into the mechanism of action of alzheimers disease what promis has discovered is that the ideal thing to target for alzheimers is soluble amyloid beta oligomers it believes that they are the root cause of alzheimers not the plaque that ultimately settles on the brain promis has discovered that by focusing on igg  isotype you can circumvent the inflammation that often comes with monoclonal antibodies promis has identified six epitopes on protein strains of misfolded amyloid precursor proteins apps apps are the misfolded proteins that eventually lead to something called fibrils which eventually clot and form plaques in the brain promis has discovered that the prion strains of those misfolded proteins carry a marker called an epitope its like a police car with a light on top promis has developed five murine antibodies that select for those epitopes so antibodies can find them on those misfolded proteins and bind to them it is actually a pretty profound breakthrough at this level again its very early stage and preclinical but promis has selected one of those five antibodies the drug that its going to advance pmn will be its first candidate in clinic i bought into promis on a financing in the summer of  ill probably hold it for another  or  years its achieved a lot with very little and its understanding of the mechanism of action of alzheimers is quite significant i think well hear about that over the course of  read more  experts following this company eden rahim
