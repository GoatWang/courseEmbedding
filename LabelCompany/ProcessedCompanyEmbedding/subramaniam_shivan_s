accession number  full text illustration omittedas a veteran executive with experience in a number of fields shivan subramaniams views on the executive challenges in a world increasingly focused on risk management have proven especially insightful here he discusses what it means to lead an enterprise at a time when the job seems more difficult than ever beforeexecutives are expected to deliver a road map to the future from the top office but at the same time grassroots innovation from the rank and file can be just as important how can an enterprise cultivate both in concert with each otherive always believed that innovation cannot just come from the people at the top of an organization in wellmanaged companies innovation also is encouraged from the grass roots those ideas in turn stoke the imagination of management and through a collaborative process can result in innovative ideas approaches products and services in the long run the most innovative organizations seek ideas from the companys leaders and every employeeit has been said that it is better to be loved than to be feared and that good leaders should inspire more than they intimidate yet there are plenty of companies with heavyhanded bosses and cultures that have been successful nevertheless is one approach really better than the othermanagement by intimidation might work well to achieve shortterm results or in small organizations that require a certain kind of focus or such an approach might work in an organization where a situation like a crisis needs to be addressed and a single voice of authority is needed to focus on the issue at hand but if you want to have a successful organization with valuable products services and dedicated employees the only longterm model that will work is leading by inspiringwhat is the difference between being a leader and being a boss and does that difference really matter when youre running a large multinational firm where the ceo is unlikely to work alongside the cubicledwellers how can you really make leadership be felt down through the ranks in a meaningful waybecause fm global has longterm employees with an average tenure of  years almost everyone in a leadership position in our organization has at some point in their careers rolled up their sleeves and been on the front line virtually all of fm globals management has worked from the proverbial cubicle at some point in time so our management understands firsthand whats involved daytoday as one climbs into the ranks of management the higher one climbs the more important it is to influence and inspire rather than to be a boss leaders really transition away from telling people what to do and toward surrounding themselves with people they can talk with regarding what are the best things to get things done ways to achieve that and then get them executed in my experience bosses tell people what to do leaders help people find their own way to get things donethe highprofile boardroom dispute between carl icahn and the yahoo board of directors in the wake of the failed merger with microsoft shines a light on the pressures executive leaders must shoulder what are your thoughts on situations when a firms leadership and the rest of its stakeholders have different ideas about what is best for the enterprisethis sort of thing makes me very glad that fm global is a mutual company owned by our policyholders and not publicly traded we dont have the kinds of issues a publicly held company might face because we have a single focus and a sole purposeto meet the needs of our clients in publicly traded companies by contrast its the board of directors who ultimately represent the interests of the investors eventually the directors wishes prevail recently microsoft ceo steve ballmer was speaking at a university in hungary when an outraged student threw eggs at him as ballmer dove for cover the somewhat embarrassing incident was caught on camera and posted to youtube what does this age of internet footage mean in terms of reputation risk especially for firms that have mixed standings in the public eyea companies should work very hard to ensure that the publics perception of its soul is ethical its better for a company to be in a position where people might disagree with its positions but not with how it got there microsoft is a very high profile organization and there are many people outside the company with strong opinions about how the company should be run when a company and its management are always in the limelight they are likely to attract criticism frankly such leaders of large wellknown companies may only truly be safe in their homes if theyre not in their homes then they must assume that everybody is going to see and hear whatever they do for those executives what that means is that you should ensure your public persona and private persona are one in the samethe recent downfall of eliot spitzer and the more recent downfall of melvyn weiss are two cases where major detractors of the financial services industry were themselves unmasked as not being the moral crusaders they pretended to be is big business as morally wayward as these two figures would suggest does their own wrongdoing negate their criticisms of corporate malfeasancethe majority of businesses operate ethically they are straightforward they take care of clients needs and they take care of their employees but it only takes one or two highprofile situations to tarnish the corporate world those negative highprofile situations are a reminder that organizations need to work very hard to be transparent communicate frequently with their stakeholders make sure their stakeholders needs are taken care of and that their employees have a great place to worksarbanesoxley was passed because the government decided that the financial services industry could not be trusted to police itself many consider the legislation to be a heavyhanded kneejerk reaction that forced many honest companies to pay for the excesses of a few dishonest ones might the same be said for most cases where the government steps in to regulate from a position of enforcement rather than a position of preventionthe most effective risk managers look at things from a preventive point of view if the existing us democratic processes focused more on prevention perhaps the country might be in a better position at times in the case of sarbanesoxley government regulators stepped in when substantial improprieties occurred in corporate america the government would rarely step in otherwise because of the free enterprise processthe good news is sox has led to some great things for corporations such as elevating the role of risk managers and how companies look at enterprise risk management while companies initial response to sox may have started out as a paperpushing exercise more corporations are now starting to assess their organizations at a deeper level to determine whether they have the right controls and risk management mechanisms in place there is no question such an approach makes for better enterprisestime and time again we see corporations that initially practice good risk management but once the money starts coming in things just slide off the rails for example it seems that every time the insurance industry makes money off of investments its underwriting discipline falls off likewise every time the investment industry starts seeing really big returns we also start seeing subsequent ethical lapses is this the natural way of things or can this really be addressedi believe there are ways it can be addressed but collectively as an industry we need to begin thinking and operating differently every time the commercial insurance industry prospers it doesnt last for long for example there were no major hurricanes that made landfall in the united states during  or  even though history tells us there is a  to  annual probability that at least a category  or  windstorm will strike florida following quiet years insurers can become complacent as their bottom lines grow subsequently the marketplace brings pressures to cut prices by yearend  the result will be lower profitability for commercial insurers even without normal levels of natural disasters if the extreme cycles are to be broken insurers need to continually remember the past learn from it and be disciplined in the long run that will result in more stable terms and conditions for insurance buyersinsurance companies comprise an industry that the public loves to hate as an insurance executive but more broadly as an executive of a notable global enterprise what lessons can corporate chiefs learn from the ongoing reputational woes of the insurance industry what does the insurance industry need to do to improve its standing in the public eye and why isnt it doing it alreadythe insurance industry sells stability if something bad happens the industry should be there to take care of its policyholders any time an insurer violates that agreement with their client a negative perception will result so i would suggest that if an insurance company is going to enter a new line of business or a new geographic region it makes sure it can offer a stable product or service for the long run for example dont write coastal insurance if there is a feeling that if there were several years of significant windstorm losses you would consider withdrawing the coveragethe industry also has to do a much better job of communicating its product and explaining the coverage what are the exclusions what are the limits how quickly will a claim be paid the onus is really on the industry to communicate that effectively before bad things happen to the policyholder because once a loss happens if im a client i dont want to hear any ifs ands or buts from my insurer i dont want to suddenly think im now going to get something thats different from what im expecting at the heart of the issue is insurers should not surprise the client when the client suffers a loss and expects its insurer to respondwhile one company can do a lot to manage expectations is there some thing the industry can be doing as a whole there is a collective reputational deficit that seems to defeat even the most noble actions of any companyour industrys product is to take care of policyholders when the worst occurs it behooves us as an industry to remind ourselves that when a client has a loss were starting off with a negative situation and being asked by the policyholder to now perform that is the moment of truth the industry needs to recognize this and manage that process better we as an industry can talk about these things through our respective trade associations but the actual policy response rests on the shoulders of each individual insurance company the industry cant manage each companys policy response but an insurers performance should be no different than what the client expects if every insurer meets those expectations the reputation of the insurance industry will improve gale copyright copyright  gale cengage learning all rights reserved   previous article
