economy during world war ii ehnet ehnet is owned and operated by the economic history associationwith the support of other sponsoring organizations search for the american economy during world war ii christopher j tassava for the united states world war ii and the great depression constituted the most important economic event of the twentieth century the war’s effects were varied and farreaching the war decisively ended the depression itself the federal government emerged from the war as a potent economic actor able to regulate economic activity and to partially control the economy through spending and consumption american industry was revitalized by the war and many sectors were by  either sharply oriented to defense production for example aerospace and electronics or completely dependent on it atomic energy the organized labor movement strengthened by the war beyond even its depressionera height became a major counterbalance to both the government and private industry the war’s rapid scientific and technological changes continued and intensified trends begun during the great depression and created a permanent expectation of continued innovation on the part of many scientists engineers government officials and citizens similarly the substantial increases in personal income and frequently if not always in quality of life during the war led many americans to foresee permanent improvements to their material circumstances even as others feared a postwar return of the depression finally the war’s global scale severely damaged every major economy in the world except for the united states which thus enjoyed unprecedented economic and political power after  the great depression the global conflict which was labeled world war ii emerged from the great depression an upheaval which destabilized governments economies and entire nations around the world in germany for instance the rise of adolph hitler and the nazi party occurred at least partly because hitler claimed to be able to transform a weakened germany into a selfsufficient military and economic power which could control its own destiny in european and world affairs even as liberal powers like the united states and great britain were buffeted by the depression in the united states president franklin roosevelt promised less dramatically to enact a “new deal” which would essentially reconstruct american capitalism and governance on a new basis as it waxed and waned between  and  roosevelt’s new deal mitigated some effects of the great depression but did not end the economic crisis in  when world war ii erupted in europe with germany’s invasion of poland numerous economic indicators suggested that the united states was still deeply mired in the depression for instance after  the american gross domestic product declined for four straight years then slowly and haltingly climbed back to its  level which was finally exceeded again in  watkins  johnston and williamson  unemployment was another measure of the depression’s impact between  and  the american unemployment rate averaged  percent calculated from “corrected bls” figures in darby   in the summer of  about  million americans were still unemployed — far fewer than the  million who had been unemployed in  about thirty percent of the american workforce but still a significant pool of unused labor and often suffering citizens darby   for somewhat different figures see table  below in spite of these dismal statistics the united states was in other ways reasonably well prepared for war the wide array of new deal programs and agencies which existed in  meant that the federal government was markedly larger and more actively engaged in social and economic activities than it had been in  moreover the new deal had accustomed americans to a national government which played a prominent role in national affairs and which at least under roosevelt’s leadership often chose to lead not follow private enterprise and to use new capacities to plan and administer largescale endeavors preparedness and conversion as war spread throughout europe and asia between  and  nowhere was the federal government’s leadership more important than in the realm of “preparedness” — the national project to ready for war by enlarging the military strengthening certain allies such as great britain and above all converting america’s industrial base to produce armaments and other war materiel rather than civilian goods “conversion” was the key issue in american economic life in  in many industries company executives resisted converting to military production because they did not want to lose consumer market share to competitors who did not convert conversion thus became a goal pursued by public officials and labor leaders in  walter reuther a highranking officer in the united auto workers labor union provided impetus for conversion by advocating that the major automakers convert to aircraft production though initially rejected by carcompany executives and many federal officials the reuther plan effectively called the public’s attention to america’s lagging preparedness for war still the auto companies only fully converted to war production in  and only began substantially contributing to aircraft production in  even for contemporary observers not all industries seemed to be lagging as badly as autos though merchant shipbuilding mobilized early and effectively the industry was overseen by the us maritime commission usmc a new deal agency established in  to revive the moribund shipbuilding industry which had been in a depression since  and to ensure that american shipyards would be capable of meeting wartime demands with the usmc supporting and funding the establishment and expansion of shipyards around the country including especially the gulf and pacific coasts merchant shipbuilding took off the entire industry had produced only  ships between  and  but from  to  commissionsponsored shipyards turned out  ships and then almost that many in  alone fischer  the industry’s position in the vanguard of american preparedness grew from its strategic import — ever more ships were needed to transport american goods to great britain and france among other american allies — and from the maritime commission’s ability to administer the industry through means as varied as construction contracts shipyard inspectors and raw goading of contractors by commission officials many of the ships built in maritime commission shipyards carried american goods to the european allies as part of the “lendlease” program which was instituted in  and provided another early indication that the united states could and would shoulder a heavy economic burden by all accounts lendlease was crucial to enabling great britain and the soviet union to fight the axis not least before the united states formally entered the war in december  though scholars are still assessing the impact of lendlease on these two major allies it is likely that both countries could have continued to wage war against germany without american aid which seems to have served largely to augment the british and soviet armed forces and to have shortened the time necessary to retake the military offensive against germany between  and  the us exported about  billion worth of goods through lendlease of which  billion went to great britain and  billion went to the soviet union milward  the war dictated that aircraft ships and shiprepair services military vehicles and munitions would always rank among the quantitatively most important lendlease goods but food was also a major export to britain milward  pearl harbor was an enormous spur to conversion the formal declarations of war by the united states on japan and germany made plain once and for all that the american economy would now need to be transformed into what president roosevelt had called “the arsenal of democracy” a full year before in december  from the perspective of federal officials in washington the first step toward wartime mobilization was the establishment of an effective administrative bureaucracy war administration from the beginning of preparedness in  through the peak of war production in  american leaders recognized that the stakes were too high to permit the war economy to grow in an unfettered laissezfaire manner american manufacturers for instance could not be trusted to stop producing consumer goods and to start producing materiel for the war effort to organize the growing economy and to ensure that it produced the goods needed for war the federal government spawned an array of mobilization agencies which not only often purchased goods or arranged their purchase by the army and navy but which in practice closely directed those goods’ manufacture and heavily influenced the operation of private companies and whole industries though both the new deal and mobilization for world war i served as models the world war ii mobilization bureaucracy assumed its own distinctive shape as the war economy expanded most importantly american mobilization was markedly less centralized than mobilization in other belligerent nations the war economies of britain and germany for instance were overseen by war councils which comprised military and civilian officials in the united states the army and navy were not incorporated into the civilian administrative apparatus nor was a supreme body created to subsume military and civilian organizations and to direct the vast war economy instead the military services enjoyed almostunchecked control over their enormous appetites for equipment and personnel with respect to the economy the services were largely able to curtail production destined for civilians eg automobiles or many nonessential foods and even for warrelated but nonmilitary purposes eg textiles and clothing in parallel to but never commensurate with the army and navy a succession of toplevel civilian mobilization agencies sought to influence army and navy procurement of manufactured goods like tanks planes and ships raw materials like steel and aluminum and even personnel one way of gauging the scale of the increase in federal spending and the concomitant increase in military spending is through comparison with gdp which itself rose sharply during the war table  shows the

“budget of the united states government historical tables fiscal year ” table —composition of outlays — and table —outlays by superfunction and function — preparedness agencies to oversee this growth president roosevelt created a number of preparedness agencies beginning in  including the office for emergency management and its key suborganization the national defense advisory commission the office of production management and the supply priorities allocation board none of these organizations was particularly successful at generating or controlling mobilization because all included two competing parties on one hand privatesector executives and managers had joined the federal mobilization bureaucracy but continued to emphasize corporate priorities such as profits and positioning in the marketplace on the other hand reformminded civil servants who were often holdovers from the new deal emphasized the state’s prerogatives with respect to mobilization and war making as a result of this basic division in the mobilization bureaucracy “the military largely remained free of mobilization agency control” koistinen  war production board in january  as part of another effort to mesh civilian and military needs president roosevelt established a new mobilization agency the war production board and placed it under the direction of donald nelson a former sears roebuck executive nelson understood immediately that the staggeringly complex problem of administering the war economy could be reduced to one key issue balancing the needs of civilians — especially the workers whose efforts sustained the economy — against the needs of the military — especially those of servicemen and women but also their military and civilian leaders though neither nelson nor other highranking civilians ever fully resolved this issue nelson did realize several key economic goals first in late  nelson successfully resolved the socalled “feasibility dispute” a conflict between civilian administrators and their military counterparts over the extent to which the american economy should be devoted to military needs during  and by implication in subsequent war years arguing that “allout” production for war would harm america’s longterm ability to continue to produce for war after  nelson convinced the military to scale back its olympian demands he thereby also established a precedent for planning war production so as to meet most military and some civilian needs second and partially as a result of the feasibility dispute the wpb in late  created the “controlled materials plan” which effectively allocated steel aluminum and copper to industrial users the cmp obtained throughout the war and helped curtail conflict among the military services and between them and civilian agencies over the growing but still scarce supplies of those three key metals office of war mobilization by late  it was clear that nelson and the wpb were unable to fully control the growing war economy and especially to wrangle with the army and navy over the necessity of continued civilian production accordingly in may  president roosevelt created the office of war mobilization and in july put james byrne — a trusted advisor a former us supreme court justice and the socalled “assistant president” — in charge though the wpb was not abolished the owm soon became the dominant mobilization body in washington unlike nelson byrnes was able to establish an accommodation with the military services over war production by “acting as an arbiter among contending forces in the wpb settling disputes between the board and the armed services and dealing with the multiple problems” of the war manpower commission the agency charged with controlling civilian labor markets and with assuring a continuous supply of draftees to the military koistinen  beneath the highestlevel agencies like the wpb and the owm a vast array of other federal organizations administered everything from labor the war manpower commission to merchant shipbuilding the maritime commission and from prices the office of price administration to food the war food administration given the scale and scope of these agencies’ efforts they did sometimes fail and especially so when they carried with them the baggage of the new deal by the midpoint of america’s involvement in the war for example the civilian conservation corps the works progress administration and the rural electrification administration — all prominent new deal organizations which tried and failed to find a purpose in the mobilization bureaucracy — had been actually or virtually abolished taxation however these agencies were often quite successful in achieving their respective narrower aims the department of the treasury for instance was remarkably successful at generating money to pay for the war including the first general income tax in american history and the famous “war bonds” sold to the public beginning in  the government extended the income tax to virtually all americans and began collecting the tax via the nowfamiliar method of continuous withholdings from paychecks rather than lumpsum payments after the fact the number of americans required to pay federal taxes rose from  million in  to  million in  with such a large pool of taxpayers the american government took in  billion in  an enormous increase over the  billion collected in  but still far short of the  billion spent on the war in  over that same period federal tax revenue grew from about  percent of gdp to more than  percent americans who earned as little as  per year paid income tax at a  percent rate while those who earned more than  million per year paid a  percent rate the average income tax rate peaked in  at  percent “fact sheet taxes” war bonds all told taxes provided about  billion of the war’s total cost of  billion kennedy  to cover the other  billion the treasury department also expanded its bond program creating the famous “war bonds” hawked by celebrities and purchased in vast numbers and enormous values by americans the first war bond was purchased by president roosevelt on may   “introduction to savings bonds” though the bonds returned only  percent annual interest after a year maturity they nonetheless served as a valuable source of revenue for the federal government and an extremely important investment for many americans bonds served as a way for citizens to make an economic contribution to the war effort but because interest on them accumulated slower than consumer prices rose they could not completely preserve income which could not be readily spent during the war by the time warbond sales ended in   million americans had purchased more than  billion worth of the securities often through automatic deductions from their paychecks “brief history of world war two advertising campaigns war loans and bonds” commercial institutions like banks also bought billions of dollars of bonds and other treasury paper holding more than  billion at the war’s end kennedy  price controls and the standard of living fiscal and financial matters were also addressed by other federal agencies for instance the office of price administration used its “general maximum price regulation” also known as “general max” to attempt to curtail inflation by maintaining prices at their march  levels in july the national war labor board nwlb a successor to a new dealera body limited wartime wage increases to about  percent the factor by which the cost of living rose from january  to may  neither “general max” nor the wageincrease limit was entirely successful though federal efforts did curtail inflation between april  and june  the period of the most stringent federal controls on inflation the annual rate of inflation was just  percent the annual rate had been  percent in the six months before april  and it soared to  percent in the six months after june  rockoff “price and wage controls in four wartime periods” with wages rising about  percent over the course of the war this limited success in cutting the rate of inflation meant that many american civilians enjoyed a stable or even improving quality of life during the war kennedy  improvement in the standard of living was not ubiquitous however in some regions such as rural areas in the deep south living standards stagnated or even declined and according to some economists the national living standard barely stayed level or even declined higgs  labor unions labor unions and their members benefited especially the nwlb’s “maintenanceofmembership” rule allowed unions to count all new employees as union members and to draw union dues from those new employees’ paychecks so long as the unions themselves had already been recognized by the employer given that most new employment occurred in unionized workplaces including plants funded by the federal government through defense spending “the maintenanceofmembership ruling was a fabulous boon for organized labor” for it required employers to accept unions and allowed unions to grow dramatically organized labor expanded from  million members in  to  million in  blum  by  approximately  percent of the nonagricultural workforce was unionized a record high the war economy at high water despite the almostcontinual crises of the civilian war agencies the american

arrived in los angeles during  alone migration was especially strong along ruralurban axes especially to warproduction centers around the country and along an eastwest axis kennedy   for instance as

reduction in the supply of civilian goods rapid increases in many americans’ personal incomes driven by the federal government’s abilities to prevent price inflation and to subsidize high wages through war contracting and by the increase in the size and power of organized labor incomes rose for virtually all americans — whites and blacks men and women skilled and unskilled workers at the lower end of the spectrum gained the most manufacturing workers enjoyed about a quarter more real income in  than in  kennedy  these rising incomes were part of a wartime “great compression” of wages

technological innovation as observers during the war and ever since have recognized scientific and technological innovations were a key aspect in the american war effort and an important economic factor in the allies’ victory while all of the major belligerents were able to tap their scientific and technological resources to develop weapons and other tools of war the american experience was impressive in that scientific and technological change positively affected virtually every facet of the war economy the manhattan project american technoscientific innovations mattered most dramatically in “hightech” sectors which were often hidden from public view by wartime secrecy for instance the manhattan project to create an atomic weapon was a direct and massive result of a stunning scientific breakthrough the creation of a controlled nuclear chain reaction by a team of scientists at the university of chicago in december  under the direction of the us army and several private contractors scientists engineers and workers built a nationwide complex of laboratories and plants to manufacture atomic fuel and to fabricate atomic weapons this network included laboratories at the university of chicago and the university of californiaberkeley uraniumprocessing complexes at oak ridge tennessee and hanford washington and the weapondesign lab at los alamos new mexico the manhattan project climaxed in august  when the united states dropped two atomic weapons on hiroshima and nagasaki japan these attacks likely accelerated japanese leaders’ decision to seek peace with the united states by that time the manhattan project had become a colossal economic endeavor costing approximately  billion and employing more than  though important and gigantic the manhattan project was an anomaly in the broader war economy technological and scientific innovation also transformed lesssophisticated but still complex sectors such as aerospace or shipbuilding the united states as david kennedy writes “ultimately proved capable of some epochal scientific and technical breakthroughs but innovated most characteristically and most tellingly in plant layout production organization economies of scale and process engineering” kennedy  aerospace aerospace provides one crucial example american heavy bombers like the b superfortress were highly sophisticated weapons which could not have existed much less contributed to the air war on germany and japan without innovations such as bombsights radar and highperformance engines or advances in aeronautical engineering metallurgy and even factory organization encompassing hundreds of thousands of workers four major factories and  billion in government spending the b project required almost unprecedented organizational capabilities

economy allied strategy in world war ii utterly depended on the movement of war materiel produced in the united states to the fighting fronts in africa europe and asia between  and  the hundred merchant shipyards overseen by the us maritime commission usmc produced  ships at a cost of about  billion navy shipbuilding cost about  billion lane  four key innovations facilitated this enormous wartime output first the commission itself allowed the federal government to direct the merchant shipbuilding industry second the commission funded entrepreneurs the industrialist henry j kaiser chief among them who had never before built ships and who were eager to use massproduction methods in the shipyards these methods including the substitution of welding for riveting and the addition of hundreds of thousands of women and minorities to the formerly allwhite and allmale shipyard workforces were a third crucial innovation last the commission facilitated mass production by choosing to build many standardized vessels like the ugly slow and ubiquitous “liberty” ship by adapting wellknown manufacturing techniques and emphasizing easilymade ships merchant shipbuilding became a lowtech counterexample to the atomicbomb project and the aerospace industry yet also a sector which was spectacularly successful reconversion and the war’s longterm effects reconversion from military to civilian production had been an issue as early as  when wpb chairman nelson began pushing to scale back war production in favor of renewed civilian production the military’s opposition to nelson had contributed to the accession by james byrnes and the owm to the paramount spot in the warproduction bureaucracy meaningful planning for reconversion was postponed until  and the actual process of reconversion only began in earnest in early  accelerating through ve day in may and vj day in september the most obvious effect of reconversion was the shift away from military production and back to civilian production as table  shows this shift — as measured by declines in overall federal spending and in military spending — was dramatic but did not cause the postwar depression which many americans dreaded rather american gdp continued to grow after the war albeit not as rapidly as it had during the war compare table  the high level of defense spending in turn contributed to the

years as returning servicemen flooded back into the workforce and many war workers left either voluntarily or involuntarily for instance many women left the labor force beginning in  — sometimes voluntarily and sometimes involuntarily in  about a quarter of all american women worked outside the home roughly the same number who had held such jobs in  and far off the wartime peak of  percent in  kennedy  gi bill servicemen obtained numerous other economic benefits beyond their jobs including educational assistance from the federal government and guaranteed mortgages and smallbusiness loans via the serviceman’s readjustment act of  or “gi bill” former servicemen thus became a vast and advantaged class of citizens which demanded among other goods inexpensive often suburban housing vocational training and college educations and private cars which had been unobtainable during the war kennedy  the us’s position at the end of the war at a macroeconomic scale the war not only decisively ended the great depression but created the conditions for productive postwar collaboration between the federal government private enterprise and organized labor the parties whose tripartite collaboration helped engender continued economic growth after the war the us emerged from the war not physically unscathed but economically strengthened by wartime industrial expansion which placed the united states at absolute and relative advantage over both its allies and its enemies possessed of an economy which was larger and richer than any other in the world american leaders determined to make the united states the center of the postwar world economy american aid to europe  billion via the economic recovery program erp or “marshall plan”  and japan  billion  furthered this goal by
