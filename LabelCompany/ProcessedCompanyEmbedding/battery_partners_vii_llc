the fund’s summary employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the

way to invest in the investment universe a different class of investment are managed futures   commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha managed funds which do are a good way to avoid painful market correction hedge fund news we offer

customer service team will help you find the correct motorcycle battery for you how to maintain and protect your motorcycle battery one of the most overlooked aspects of motorcycles is battery maintenance for many there is a time during the year you put your motorcycle away for storage for a few months or even let it sit inactive for a longer period of time this can be a huge problem as batteries dont respond well to inactivity motorcycle batteries that sit for longer periods of time will build up sulphation on the battery plates the sulphation will cause your batterys runtime performance and life to noticeably decrease in the more advanced stages the battery can be difficult or even impossible to charge or start your motorcycle however you can prevent this from happening and ensure that your battery holds up after inactivity use an automatic battery chargermaintainer these units plug into standard vac outlets and provide your battery with a charge current this will keep the battery fully charged and maintained so that sulphation never builds up it also helps towards breaking up loose sulphation that already may be present automatic chargers like the batteryminder by vdc or battery tender by deltran are perfect for these applications both of these brands can maintain your batteries in ways that prevent damage to your battery it is always recommended if youre using a maintainer on any wet battery to make sure you monitor the water level of the battery these chargers are fully automatic and can be left connected to your battery all the time keep your motorcycle battery in top shape there are many types of batteries and the two most common types for motorcycles are conventional wet and dry agm absorbed glass mat batteries in some cases bmw motorcycles use gel batteries in these cases a specific gel charger must be used as standard chargers will not work on gel batteries if you have a conventional battery youll need to keep an eye on your fluid levels and add distilled water as needed you should also clean your terminals with cleaning chemicals and protect them with a corrosion preventative do not let your motorcycle battery freeze whenever you decide to store your bikes battery be sure its in a place that does not consistently fall below freezing this is an extremely quick way to find yourself with a cracked battery if you keep a battery maintainer connected to your battery this also helps work towards keeping the battery from freezing if youd like to look a little more indepth or see some recommendations please check out our article on the subject if you have any questions about battery maintenance and would like to speak with one of our battery specialists please give us a call at  keeping your motorcycle battery in top condition motorcycle batteries tend to last between  and  years before needing to be replaced as long as the batteries are properly maintained as with any battery that sits for longer periods of time without being used such as sitting through the winter months the battery naturally lose their charge over time  will build up sulphation on the battery plates this is the number one reason for premature battery failure in spite of various opinions once enough heavy sulphation builds up on the battery plates it is very difficult if not impossible to reverse this process thus the reason for using a battery maintainer so the sulphation process never starts to begin with and the battery is kept fully charged if your motorcycle battery is going to sit unused for longer than a month it is always recommended to use any  amp fully automatic battery maintainer such as the battery tender or battery minder there are two reasons for this keep sulphation from building up on the battery plateskeep the battery fully charged it is also advantageous to remove battery cables from the battery as this eliminates any possible draws from the battery there are three types of motorcycle batteries wet gel and agm absorbed glass mat most manufacturers use wet or agm batteries the biggest issue with gel batteries is they charge at a lower rate then wet or agm batteries wet and agm batteries have the same charging characteristics if youre using a gel battery the charging system must be set up specifically for gel batteries as with any battery maintainer which also must be set to do gel batteries a wet batterys biggest draw back is the battery acid which can evaporate if it sits for longer periods of time especially if connected to a battery maintainer for that time if you have a wet battery where you can check the fluid levels then you should always do so and keep the fluid levels topped off the positive and negative connections on any battery should always be kept cleaned to ensure maximum transfer of electrical charge there are special products that are made just for this type of maintenance although using water and baking soda is effective for most people by properly maintaining any battery you can greatly enhance battery life which can result in having a working battery for years to come charge to the top copyright   batterymartcom all rights

remove the battery from a laptop if your laptop cannot function without a battery this procedure won’t be effective on the other side if it can the battery life will be extended this is possible due to the fact when you do it you will stop the chemical process in the battery and you will reset it as the end result your battery will be able to recharge a lot better and stay full for a longer period of time recondition nicad batteries you should know that nicad batteries can be reconditioned as well however first you should know why they get damaged this happens due to the sulfur crystals that eventually reach both terminals and it prevents charging this can be solved so your batteries will last for a long time in addition the procedure is more than just simple don’t buy  new battery – do this instead video you are going to need the flash camera capacitor there are a lot of cheap cameras of this type that you can disassemble and use their parts you will know what a capacitor is due to the fact it is a big cylinder part add a battery holder and a switch to the capacitor stick the wires to the big black cylinder and connect them with the battery holder and a switch make sure all wires are insulated and they don’t touch anything that can conduct electricity place an alkaline battery into the capacitor and the nicad battery into the holder you added before then press the switch and wait the led to glow then repeat the step keep in mind that you should hear a sound that’s meansthat the sulfur crystals are destroyed and your battery can be used again once you make this ‘’gadget’’ you can use it for reconditioning nicad batteries for ever it may sound complicated but it is very simple and you cannot make a mistake in addition it is possible to buy a capacitor for this application but it is too much expensive and it won’t do the job better than this device how to recondition lead acid batteries lead acid batteries are expensive so reconditioning one is a better choice than to buy a new one at the same time it is possible to fix an old battery and get several more years from it in any case this is a simple procedure but it may be dangerous due to the fact the acid can be dangerous in any case you will have to follow the next steps video bring your old batteries back to life instead of buying new ones remove the battery and open the caps some batteries have rubber protection but you can easily remove it as well remove all the caps and do not place them back until you are done  in most cases a battery won’t have enough distilled water and this is the main issue in that case add the distilled water and recharge the battery once again do not place the caps back keep in mind that the battery must have between  and  volts when you measure it with a voltmeter  if this doesn’t solve the problem you can try a more aggressive method you should get an acid pack and replace the acid and add new distiller water in that case repeat the procedure with charging and you should get a new battery don’t forget that the charging battery should be between  and  hours if you use a slow charger on the other side if you use a quick charger you can recharge it in less than  hours it is a much better choice to measure the battery levels with a voltmeter while charging in order to get the best results keep in mind that this type of acid can be dangerous so it isn’t a very safe procedure but you can manage it and be completely protected if you wear goggles and gloves the situation is the same if you are planning to completely replace the battery acid in some cases if the battery cells are damaged you won’t get the  capacity from the battery as when it was new on the other side you will get more than  of the power the battery had when it was new this is enough for most batteries simply because it is enough power for their applications learning yourself how to recondition batteries will have a positive effect on the environment and the planet in general at the same time you will save money and you will be able to prolong the life of your batteries on the other side all these procedures are very simple check our recommended battery
