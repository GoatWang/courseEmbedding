documents certifying the april  election at the close of monday’s meeting daily news photo by brian o’connor st thomas — after hours of testimony and months of legal wrangling it took members of the st thomasst john district board of elections slightly longer than  minutes to certify the results of the april  electionboard members lydia hendricks and alecia wells voted in favor of a motion certifying the results board member carla joseph cast the lone dissent chairman arturo watlington jr and board member ivy moses abstainedonly joseph elected to offer remarks at the meeting about her vote during the meeting her vote was about upholding voters’ rights joseph said “in my estimation we have endeavored to be compliant with the laws as written” she said “even though there are members who may have had information and withheld i want to say that definitely we want to make sure that we go forward to ensure that our voters’ rights are not disenfranchised”voting to certify the election results from april  would have disenfranchised those who voted in the nov  elections as well as those who voted in the aug  primary elections according to josephshe said numerous voters had approached her with hard questions after the nd legislature voted on june  to effectively overturn the results of the nov  general election joseph said her vote was ultimately an act of conscienceby contrast hendricks and wells were relatively short on words about their votes which ultimately carried the day“i just did what i had to do” wells saidmoses’ abstention meant hendricks was the only member of

suggested she may have just wanted to bring the lingering  election matter to a close hendricks agreed“yes” she said “i’m tired”moses declined the opportunity for comment watlington said his abstention could be counted as a disagreement and disputed that a court could order an elected board — as opposed to an administrative entity which are more frequently the subject of writs of mandamus — to vote one way or another“the judge can’t tell anybody how to vote” he said “i don’t know if the judge can really order anybody what to do”for example neither maurice donovan jr nor diane
