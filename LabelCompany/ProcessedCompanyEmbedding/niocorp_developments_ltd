detailed independent analysis by dozens of technical experts the elk creek project feasibility study significantly derisks this project and positions us to advance to the next stages – project financing and eventual construction start” said niocorp executive chair and ceo mark a smith pe esq “the primary goal of any project feasibility study is to derisk the proposed project such that financing can be obtained” said mr smith  “this feasibility study accomplishes that core goal  coupled with the fact that we have commitments for  of our ferroniobium over the first  years –  going to thyssenkrupp metallurgical products and  going to cmc cometals of new jersey – and that we have in hand a major federal government permit this project is significantly derisked at this stage  in particular it will allow us to continue ongoing discussions with potential institutional investors in europe and elsewhere including with the german government’s loan guarantee program for which the elk creek project has already received inprinciple eligibility” “i’m also very proud of the fact that scott honan and his team were able to complete this feasibility study in a little over three

project production of a highpurity  commercial grade scandium trioxide material this highpurity product should be able to meet the needs of virtually every use of scandium of which we are aware it meets or exceeds the purity specifications of all of the potential customers with whom we have been in discussions regarding future scandium sales we are sending samples of elk creek scandium to prospective customers shortly   demonstrating our ability to produce a commercial scandium product with a  purity known in our business as ns or “three nines” scandium is a major milestone in our ongoing effort to move the elk creek project forward additionally we have now been able to finalize our plans for the scandium purification circuit to be used in the elk creek facility locking down the chemical processes we intend to use in this circuit was one of the final major elements necessary for completion of the elk creek feasibility study   now with our highpurity scandium production capacities proven we are approaching the finish line for our feasibility study fs the volume of work that remains in the fs is not trivial to be sure and it will take a number of weeks to complete but the most challenging elements of this or any mining project fs have been completed and are behind us click to enlarge   niocorp developments ltd tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br  south yosemite suite

quarter of this calendar year thus after more than three years of very hard work by a lot of very experienced and dedicated professionals we can see a completed elk creek project fs on the nearterm horizon   click to enlarge     video available here  httpsyoutubejxxplywvq   we made a conscious decision more than a year ago to invest extra time and resources into optimizing certain components of the project particularly the metallurgical processes that are designed to produce our commercial products while this increased the time to complete the fs beyond our initial projections past experience had shown us that extra effort in this area can yield substantial benefits   in short there are no roadblocks to completing the fs and we are engaged in wrapping up the final components now we are on track to deliver a major mining project fs years faster than most explorationstage companies seeking to develop a project of this magnitude as you can imagine i very much look forward to sharing with you the results of all of this work   what work remains on the feasibility study   while we have proceeded with our fs on a very rapid pace relative to most other mining companies watching this process from the sidelines can be like watching water boil or watching paint dry you can pick your analogy   niocorp developments ltd tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br  south yosemite suite  centennial colorado  usa tel niocorp     page  tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br     to help our owners better understand what remains to be done in our fs and what this works involves i asked the team to construct a list of the final major elements that remain here is what the team is working on now and is moving to completion   final remaining tasks for the elk creek feasibility study   materials characterization for impoundment design and mine backfill purposes   we are now analyzing and quantifying the physical geotechnical environmental and geochemical properties of our plant tailings and evaluating their engineering properties for use as a backfill material in the mine testing required in this process involves the curing of a range of mixtures of the tailings with cement and or backfill that can take up to  days the properties determined during these test programs will drive the capital and operating costs of the backfill system and the surface impoundment   fslevel hydrometallurgical engineering design   we have now locked down hydrometallurgical process and are working to complete the fslevel process engineering layout and cost estimating for the hydrometallurgical plant where we chemically separate and purify scandium titanium and niobium oxides  we have already completed this work for the pyrometallurgical plant mineral processing plant wastewater treatment plant and supporting infrastructure systems   cost estimating   we are securing multiple vendor cost estimates on major equipment and process systems as design engineering for those systems is advanced  this involves providing an fslevel engineering specification to each vendor in order to get an fslevel estimate for the cost of each major piece of equipment these quotes are important in estimating costs of construction a key input to the fs   updates to market studies for planned commercial products   given that previously commissioned market studies are more than one year old we are having these updated  these updates are nearly completed   niocorp developments ltd tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br  south yosemite suite  centennial colorado  usa tel niocorp     page  tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br     final capexopex estimates   once all design engineering cost estimates and other inputs are finalized this data is integrated into the fs technical economic model which will provide project capital expenditures capex mining rates production rates and operating expenditures opex the model is prepared with a targeted capex and opex accuracy of   the model will reflect a detailed construction and commissioning schedule for all aspects of the project   final remaining tasks for the elk creek feasibility study cont   final review of feasibility study prior to release   a careful review will be conducted of the fs documents to ensure consistency across its many elements and to conduct stresstesting of the economic model which helps us prepare for the process we will go through with institutional investors   public release of feasibility study results and global promotion of findings   this will be done via a news release  we also will conduct an extensive series of briefings following the news release’s dissemination to a wide variety of audiences on the study’s results including to residents of southeastern nebraska via a town hall meeting existing and new investors institutional funds and banks the news media elected officials and regulators and many others   release of feasibility study document   this is required within  days of the public release of the fs findings release of this document will allow us to kick our project financing campaign into high gear as these documents provide the technical details that the financial community will want to review as we discuss project financing options   niocorp developments ltd tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br  south yosemite suite  centennial colorado  usa tel niocorp     page  tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br     the benefits of our intense focus on metallurgical process optimization   as you may have read in niocorp press releases over the past several months our decision to spend additional time and energy in an effort to further optimize the elk creek facility’s metallurgical processes is likely to pay off in several areas relative to the findings of our october  preliminary economic assessment “oct  pea” these advances are likely to  reduce capex and opex of certain components of the project  shrink the project’s environmental footprint and  streamline our permitting process   the details of these advances will be outlined in our fs but here is a quick recap of what we can disclose at this point   innovations through metallurgical optimization   less water à smaller equipment   our engineers discovered a way to attain high rates of niobium recovery while using much less water that originally required  this allowed us to reduce the size of a number of major pieces of equipment in our designs for the niobium recovery and purification processes and water management infrastructure  these size reductions are expected have beneficial impacts to capex and opex costs for those portions of the plant   recycling some of our waste stream into usable materials   the team engineered a pathway to take significant fractions of the neutralization and acid regeneration solids that we expected to produce and convert them into supplies of neutralizing agents and process reagents that we use to make commercial products  in other words we found a way to recycle some of our planned waste streams and convert them into usable material     niocorp developments ltd tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br  south yosemite suite  centennial colorado  usa tel niocorp     page  tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br     benefits of these breakthroughs   ü a reduction in the size of niocorp’s planned acid generation plant which is designed to recycle chemical reagents used in the production of commercial products   ü an estimated  reduction in certain reagent purchases from third parties   ü an estimated  reduction in the volumes of neutralization solids and leaching residue as compared to that expected to be produced by the processes outlined in our oct  pea   ü lower costs associated with the project’s planned tailings storage facility   ü elimination of the construction and operation of approximately seven kilometers of a railroad spur line and associated rail transport infrastructure for the project that advance coupled with other changes we made to the layout of the processing facility allowed us to reduce the overall project’s estimated impact on wetlands and other federally regulated waters to less than  acres of wetlands and less than  feet of contiguous stream channel in total that includes impacts from our planned waterline to the missouri river   ü no ea or eis it now highly likely that the regulatory approval we will need from the us army corps of engineers will require neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement either of those regulatory processes can add many months or years to a project like this

documents we will continue work on and we will kick things into high gear on a number of elements of the project   · community and investor outreach soon after we release the highlevel findings of the fs we will launch a number of public and investor outreach programs to communicate the results from the fs these will include   ü a conference call with investors from around the globe to walk through the fs’s findings and discuss next steps in moving the project forward   ü a southeast nebraska town hall meeting to which you certainly are invited where we will walk through the fs and our plans for the project in extensive detail   ü briefings to potential customers downstream industry representatives public policymakers and regulators and many other current and future stakeholders in the

available here  httpsyoutubetrvzgfrhg   · permitting  we expect to file for and obtain approval this year from the us army corps of engineers usace for a nationwide permit under section  of the clean water act that will cover both our surface processing facilities and the waterline that we intend to construct to the missouri river this permitting pathway will require neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement which is a very big and a very positive change from what we had assumed in our october  preliminary economic assessment this more streamlined permitting process was made possible by scott’s team’s ability to reduce our likely impacts on wetlands and other federally regulated waters to such low levels that the project does not require such reviews this is a direct result of spending more time and resources in conducting our fs the usace permit is the only federal permit we need to secure for this project which is another aspect of this project that differentiates it from many other mining projects there are a number of state and local permits we are working to secure and i anticipate success in all of those efforts   · project finance the effort to finance the project will kick into high gear after release of the detailed fs documents actually i have been engaged for many months in preliminary discussions with major investment groups across several continents at this stage i can report that potential investment interest in our project is high assuming that our fs findings prospects for sale of our commercial products and other factors are considered attractive to investors institutional investment funds and lenders will go through our fs documents in great detail and they will challenge us on virtually every point of the fs as part of their due diligence process   niocorp developments ltd tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br  south yosemite suite  centennial colorado  usa tel niocorp     page  tsx nb  otcqx niobf  fse br          fortunately we have been through this process before and we know what to expect and how to prepare this is yet another reason why it is critically important that a project’s fs be done with great attention to detail and accuracy and by teams who are veterans of this process   one major element of our financing package is a potential lowinterest loan guarantee from the german government through its untied loan program because of the fact that we secured a commercial offtake agreement for up to  of our ferroniobium with germanbased thyssenkrupp the project has received inprinciple eligibility approval under this program the next step in this process is to have german loan guarantee program officials review our detailed fs documents   · construction launch while the launch of construction activities in nebraska is contingent upon many factors – sufficient permitting approvals and sufficient access to capital resources to name two of the biggest – my hope is that we can begin construction activities by the end of  or in calendar q of  the expected length of construction period and launch of commercial construction will be outlined in detail in our fs but believe me i intend for us to push forward on all of these fronts as rapidly as we can   thank you for your patience and support   in summary i want to thank you for your continuing patience and
