college of virginia in richmond her attacker apparently gained access to the house by cutting out a large portion of a secondstory bedroom window screen the medical examiner determined that the cause of hellams death was ligature strangulation apparently caused by two belts found around her neck on november   diane cho a yearold high school student was found in her familys apartment located on gavilan court in chesterfield county near richmond she too was raped and strangled in circumstances similar to the davis and hellams murders spencers final known victim susan tucker  is believed to have been raped and murdered in her condominium in arlington virginia on or about november   however her body was not found in her apartment until december   despite the change in location her injuries left detectives certain that her death was caused by the murderer now dubbed by the press as the southside strangler on january   rena chapouris and michael st hilaire were found dead within a few blocks of each other in circumstances which appeared similar to the previous murders though initially thought to be the work of the southside strangler chapouris death was subsequently determined to be the work of a copycat as she had not been raped as previous victims and st hilaires death was ultimately determined to be a suicide investigationedit on january   arlington county police arrested timothy wilson spencer a yearold richmond resident for the rape and murder of susan tucker in her arlington home police established that spencer had traveled from richmond to arlington

thomas kelley spencer was convicted and sentenced to death following the presentation of dna evidence linking him to the tucker crime scene the first case in virginia in which dna was successfully used to prove an offenders identity following his conviction for the tucker murder spencer again went on trial this time in richmond for the rape burglary and murder of debbie davis dna evidence in the form of semen and hairs collected at the scene of debbie davis murder was determined to be consistent with spencers dna forensic evidence given at his trial indicated that the statistical likelihood that the dna found at the crime scene came from someone other than spencer was one in  spencer was convicted of the rape burglary and capital murder of debbie davis on september   spencer came to trial again in richmond for the rape burglary and murder of susan hellams on january   he was convicted and sentenced to death again following the introduction of dna evidence linking him to the scene of hellams murder following the successful conviction of spencer for the tucker davis and hellams murders his dna was compared with samples collected at other crime scenes including both open and apparently closed cases as a result of these investigations it was determined that dna evidence linked him to the  murder of carol hamm a crime for which david vasquez had been convicted in early  while the standard of the dna evidence was determined to be inconclusive fbi investigators were sufficiently confident given the factual similarities to the more recent crimes to report their conclusion that spencer most likely was responsible for the hamm murder among others vasquez was granted an unconditional pardon for her murder on january   having served five years of a year prison sentence and became the first american to be exonerated on the basis of contradictory dna evidence despite the conclusions of investigators as to his guilt spencer was never in fact charged or convicted for carol hamms murder dna evidence was not sufficiently conclusive in diane chos case nevertheless spencer was tried and convicted for her murder spencers appeals against his conviction for the murders of susan tucker debbie davis and susan hellams were turned down the united states court of appeal affirmed in its judgement that the reliance on evidence based on new dna technology in
