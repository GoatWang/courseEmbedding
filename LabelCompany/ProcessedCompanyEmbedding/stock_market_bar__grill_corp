beer let the market decide says a new restaurant in manhattan where prices for food and beverages will fluctuate like stock prices in increments according to demand the exchange bar  grill set amid the bustling shops and pubs of the grammercy park neighborhood is replete with a ticker tape flashing menu prices in red lettering as demand forces them to fluctuate customers can move prices for all beverages and bar snacks such as hot wings  for  pieces or fried calamari  the prices will fluctuate in  cent increments but will most likely plateau at a  change in either direction a glass of guinness starts at  but could be pushed to a high of  or a low of  depending on popularity so if one drink is in heavy demand its price will rise causing the cost of other equivalent drinks to drop a rush on a particular beer would increase its price and cause other beers to drop owners levent cakar and damon bae admit the stock exchange theme is a gimmick but hope a good deal on drinks and their

companies in berlin and mumbai to develop a pricing algorithm that is the closest thing you’ll find to realtime markets” he said “effectively if someone buys three beers then the price of that beer will rise and the price of others will decrease the more popular a drink is the more expensive it will be – it’s market economics”reserve bar stock exchange opens on gresham street next thursday june
