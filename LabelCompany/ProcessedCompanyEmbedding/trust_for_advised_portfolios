trust�s board of trustees without shareholder approval if a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of investment a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in values

before implementing the change of policy any such notice will be provided in plain english in a separate written disclosure document containing the following prominent statement in boldtype �important

determines to change the investment objective for either of the funds the applicable fund will provide  days prior written notice to the shareholders before implementing the change of investment objective investment objective micro cap fund ��������the micro cap fund�s investment objective is longterm capital appreciation which it seeks by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of micro cap companies the micro cap fund will under normal circumstances invest at least  of its assets in common stocks of micro cap companies from time to time the micro cap fund may invest in other equitytype securities such as convertible bonds preferred stocks and warrants to purchase common stock the micro cap fund may invest in securities not listed on a national or regional securities exchange but such securities typically will have an established overthecounter market the micro cap fund does not intend to invest in any security that at the time of purchase is not readily marketable the micro cap fund may for temporary defensive purposes invest more than  of its assets in money market securities including us government obligations certificates of deposit bankers� acceptances commercial paper or cash and cash equivalents except for temporary defensive purposes the micro cap fund will retain cash and cash equivalents only in amounts deemed adequate for current needs and to permit the micro cap fund to take advantage of investment opportunities active income fund ��������the active income fund seeks to provide high current income and capital appreciation it invests primarily in us fixed income and floating rate securities both investment and noninvestment grade credit quality the active income fund will not invest in bonds in default the active income fund may also invest in dollar denominated and nondollar denominated bonds issued outside of the us engage in short sales utilize derivatives such as options and futures and effect shortterm transactions such as forward roll transactions with respect to forward roll transactions the active income fund covers the transaction or maintains sufficient liquid assets in accordance with applicable requirements the active income fund has no limit with respect to its portfolio maturity or duration the active income fund may for temporary defensive purposes invest more than  of its assets in money market securities including us government obligations certificates of deposit bankers� acceptances commercial paper or cash and cash equivalents except for temporary defensive purposes the active income fund will retain cash and cash equivalents only in amounts deemed adequate for current needs and to permit it to pay its expenses satisfy redemption requests or take advantage of investment opportunities b investment strategies and risks principal investment strategies and risks respecting the micro cap fund ��������because the micro cap fund intends to invest mainly in common stocks of micro cap companies an investment in the micro cap fund is subject to greater risks than those of funds that invest in larger companies ��������investments in micro cap companies tend to be speculative and volatile relatively small companies may lack depth in management on which to rely should loss of key personnel occur such companies may have or may develop only a regional market for products or services and may be adversely affected by purely local events further relatively small companies also may be involved in the development or marketing of new products or services the market for which may not have been established moreover such companies may be unable to compete with larger companies which have more resources lastly such companies may not have access to adequate financing resulting in a higher risk of insolvency ��������relative to large companies equity securities of micro cap companies are generally thinly traded and often will be closely held with only a small proportion of the outstanding securities held by the general public in view of such factors the micro cap fund may assume positions in securities with volatile share prices therefore the current net asset value �nav� of the micro cap fund may fluctuate significantly accordingly the micro cap fund should not be considered suitable for investors who are unable or unwilling to assume the risks of loss inherent in such a fund principal investment strategies and risks respecting the active income fund ��������the active income fund invests primarily in us fixed income and floating rate securities both investment and noninvestment grade credit quality the active income fund is actively managed and may invest in derivatives including for speculative purposes in view of this the active income fund may be subject to aboveaverage risk ��������the active income fund may invest in noninvestment grade fixedincome securities commonly known as �junk bonds� that are considered predominantly speculative by traditional investment standards noninvestment grade fixedincome securities and unrated securities of comparable credit quality are subject to the increased risk of an issuer�s inability to meet principal and interest payment obligations these securities may be subject to greater price volatility due to such factors as specific corporate developments interest rate sensitivity negative perceptions of the junk bond markets generally and less secondary market liquidity b ��������derivatives from time to time the active income fund may use derivatives for hedging attempting to reduce risk by offsetting one investment position with another or speculation taking a position in the hope of increasing return these derivative transactions will involve forward contracts future contracts options and swaps including options on futures and swaps the use of derivative instruments for both hedging and speculative purposes involves a risk of loss or depreciation possibly greater than that associated with investing directly in the underlying assets for a more detailed discussion of derivatives please see the section entitled �derivatives� below ��������short sales the active income fund may seek to realize additional gains through short sale transactions in securities listed on one or more national securities exchanges or in unlisted securities short selling involves the sale of borrowed securities at the time a short sale is effected the fund incurs an obligation to replace the security borrowed at whatever its price may be at the time the fund purchases it for delivery to the lender the price at such time may be more or less than the price at which the security was sold by the fund until the security is replaced the fund is required to pay the lender amounts equal to any dividend or interest which accrue during the period of the loan to borrow the security the fund also may be required to pay a premium which would increase the cost of the security sold the proceeds of the short sale will be retained by the broker to the extent necessary to meet margin requirements until the short position is closed ��������until the active income fund closes its short position or replaces the borrowed security the fund will a maintain cash or liquid securities at such a level that the amount deposited in the account plus the amount deposited with the broker as collateral will equal the current value of the security sold short or b otherwise cover the fund�s short position ��������corporate debt securities the active income fund may invest in corporate debt securities corporate debt securities include corporate bonds debentures notes and other similar instruments including certain convertible securities debt securities may be acquired with warrants attached corporate incomeproducing securities also may include forms of preferred or preference stock the rate of interest on a corporate debt security may be fixed floating or variable and may vary inversely with respect to a reference rate such as interest rates or other financial indications the active income fund can invest in corporate securities of any rating the rate of return or return of principal on some debt obligations may be linked or indexed to the level of exchange rates between the us dollar and a foreign currency or currencies ��������variable and floating rate securities variable and floating rate securities provide for a periodic adjustment in the interest rate paid on the obligations the terms of such obligations must provide that interest rates are adjusted periodically based upon an interest rate adjustment index as provided in the respective obligations the adjustment intervals may be regular and range from daily up to annually or may be event based such as based on a change in the prime rate ��������the active income fund may invest in floating rate debt instruments �floaters� the interest rate on a floater is a variable rate which is tied to another interest rate such as a moneymarket index like the london interbank offered rate �libor� or us treasury bill rate the interest rate on a floater resets periodically typically every six months because of the interest rate reset feature floaters provide the active income fund with a certain degree of protection against rises in interest rates although the active income fund will participate in any declines in interest rates as well b ��������the active income fund also may invest in inverse floating rate debt instruments �inverse floaters� the interest rate on an inverse floater resets in the opposite direction from the market rate of interest to which the inverse floater is indexed or inversely to a multiple of the applicable index an inverse floating rate security may exhibit greater price volatility than a fixed rate obligation of similar credit quality ��������high yield securities the active income fund may invest in high yield high risk lowerrated debt securities including convertible securities investments in such securities are subject to greater credit risks than higher rated securities debt securities rated below investment grade have greater risks of default than investment grade debt securities including medium grade debt securities and may in fact be in default issuers of �junk bonds� must offer higher yields to compensate for the greater risk of default on the payment of principal and interest ��������the market for high yield securities is subject to substantial volatility for example an economic downturn may have a more significant effect on high yield securities and their markets as well as on the ability of securities issuers to repay principal and interest than on higherrated securities and their issuers issuers of high yield securities may be of low creditworthiness and the high yield securities may be subordinated to the claims of senior lenders during periods of economic downturn or rising interest rates the issuers of high yield securities may have greater potential for insolvency and a higher incidence of high yield bond defaults may be experienced ��������the prices of high yield securities have been found to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than higherrated investments but are more sensitive to adverse economic changes or individual corporate developments because of their lower credit quality during an economic downturn or substantial period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issuers may experience financial stress which would adversely affect their ability to service their principal and interest payment obligations to meet projected business goals and to obtain additional financing if the issuer of a high yield convertible security owned by the active income fund defaults the active income fund may incur additional expenses in seeking recovery periods of economic uncertainty and changes can be expected to result in increased volatility of market prices of high yield securities and the active income fund�s nav yields on high yield securities will fluctuate over time furthermore in the case of high yield securities structured as zero coupon or payinkind securities their market prices are affected to a greater extent by interest rate changes and thereby tend to be more volatile than market prices of securities which pay interest periodically and in cash ��������the secondary market for high yield securities may at times become less liquid or respond to adverse publicity or investor perceptions making it more difficult for the active income fund to value accurately high yield securities or dispose of them to the extent the active income fund owns or may acquire illiquid or restricted high yield securities these securities may involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity difficulties and judgment will play a greater role in valuation because there is less reliable and objective data available b ��������special tax considerations are associated with investing in high yield bonds structured as zero coupon or payinkind securities the active income fund will report the interest on these securities as income even though it receives no cash interest until the security�s maturity or payment date further the active income fund must distribute substantially all of its income to its shareholders to qualify for passthrough treatment under the tax law accordingly the active income fund may have to dispose of its portfolio securities under disadvantageous circumstances to generate cash or may have to borrow to satisfy distribution requirements ��������credit ratings evaluate the safety of principal and interest payments not the market value risk of high yield securities since credit rating agencies may fail to timely change the credit ratings to reflect subsequent events lotsoff capital management the funds� investment adviser the �adviser� monitors the issuers of highyield convertible securities in the portfolio to determine if the issuers will have sufficient cash flow and profits to meet required principal and interest payments and to attempt to assure the securities� liquidity so the active income fund can meet redemption requests to the extent that the active income fund invests in high yield securities the achievement of its investment objective may be more dependent on the adviser�s own credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds the active income fund may retain a portfolio security whose rating has been changed nonprincipal investment strategies and risks related to one or both funds ��������illiquid securities ��������each fund may invest up to  of its net assets in securities for which there is no readily available market �illiquid securities� the  limitation includes certain securities whose disposition would be subject to legal restrictions �restricted securities� however certain restricted securities that may be resold pursuant to rule a under the securities act may be considered liquid rule a permits certain qualified institutional buyers to trade in privately placed securities not registered under the securities act institutional markets for restricted securities have developed as a result of rule a providing both readily ascertainable market values for rule a securities and the ability to liquidate these securities to satisfy redemption requests however an insufficient number of qualified institutional buyers interested in purchasing rule a securities held by a fund could adversely affect their marketability causing the fund to sell securities at unfavorable prices the board of trustees of the trust has delegated to the adviser the daytoday determination of the liquidity of a security although it has retained oversight and ultimate responsibility for such determinations although no definite quality criteria are used the board of trustees has directed the adviser to consider such factors as i the nature of the market for a security including the institutional private resale markets ii the terms of these securities or other instruments allowing for the disposition to a third party or the issuer thereof eg certain repurchase obligations and demand instruments iii the availability of market quotations and iv other permissible factors ��������restricted securities may be sold in privately negotiated or other exempt transactions or in a public offering with respect to which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act when registration is required a fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and considerable time may elapse between the decision to sell and the sale date if during such period adverse market conditions were to develop the fund might obtain a less favorable price than the price which prevailed when it decided to sell restricted securities for which there is no market will be valued by appraisal at their fair value as determined in good faith by the adviser under procedures established by and under the general supervision and responsibility of the trust�s board of trustees b ��������lending of portfolio securities ��������the micro cap fund may lend portfolio securities constituting up to   of its total assets as permitted by the  act to unaffiliated brokerdealers banks or other recognized institutional borrowers of securities provided that the borrower at all times maintains cash us government securities or equivalent collateral or provides an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the micro cap fund equal in value to at least  of the value of the securities loaned during the time portfolio securities are on loan the borrower pays the micro cap fund an amount equivalent to any dividends or interest paid on such securities and the micro cap fund may receive an agreedupon amount of interest income from the borrower who delivered equivalent collateral or provided a letter of credit loans are subject to termination at the option of the micro cap fund or the borrower the micro cap fund may pay reasonable administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan of portfolio securities and may pay a negotiated portion of the interest earned on the cash or equivalent collateral to the borrower or placing broker the micro cap fund does not have the right to vote securities on loan but could terminate the loan and regain the right to vote if that were considered important with respect to the investment ��������the primary risk in securities lending is a default by the borrower during a sharp rise in price of the borrowed security resulting in a deficiency in the collateral posted by the borrower the micro cap fund will seek to minimize this risk by requiring that the value of the securities loaned be computed each day and additional collateral be furnished each day if required ��������borrowing ��������each fund is authorized to borrow money from banks as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency purposes in amounts not in excess of  of the value of the fund�s net assets at the time of borrowing for example a fund may borrow money to facilitate management of the fund�s portfolio by enabling the fund to meet redemption requests when the liquidation of portfolio investments would be inconvenient or disadvantageous a fund will not purchase portfolio securities when outstanding borrowings exceed  of the fund�s total assets as required by the  act a fund may only borrow from a bank and must maintain continuous asset coverage total assets including assets acquired with borrowed funds less liabilities exclusive of borrowings of  of all amounts borrowed if at any time the value of the fund�s assets should fail to meet this  coverage test the fund will reduce the amount of the fund�s borrowings to the extent necessary to meet this  coverage within three days not including saturdays sundays and holidays maintenance of this percentage limitation may result in the sale of portfolio securities at a time when investment considerations otherwise indicate that it would be disadvantageous to do so ��������money market instruments ��������each fund may invest in cash and money market securities a fund may do so to �cover� investment techniques when taking a temporary defensive position or to have assets available to pay expenses satisfy redemption requests or take advantage of investment opportunities the money market securities in which the funds invest include us treasury bills commercial paper commercial paper master notes and repurchase agreements ��������each fund may invest in commercial paper or commercial paper master notes rated at the time of purchase a or a by standard  poor�s corporation or prime or prime by moody�s investors service inc commercial paper master notes are demand instruments without a fixed maturity bearing interest at rates that are fixed to known lending rates and automatically adjusted when such lending rates change b ��������under a repurchase agreement a fund purchases a debt security and simultaneously agrees to sell the security back to the seller at a mutually agreedupon future price and date normally one day or a few days later the resale price is greater than the purchase price reflecting an agreedupon market interest rate during the purchaser�s holding period while the maturities of the underlying securities in repurchase transactions may be more than one year the term of each repurchase agreement will always be less than one year the fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with member banks of the federal reserve system or primary dealers of us government securities the adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of each of the firms which is a party to a repurchase agreement with the fund in the event of a default or bankruptcy by the seller the fund will liquidate those securities whose market value including accrued interest must be at least equal to  of the dollar amount invested by the fund in each repurchase agreement held under the applicable repurchase agreement which securities constitute collateral for the seller�s obligation to pay however liquidation could involve costs or delays and to the extent proceeds from the sale of these securities were less than the agreedupon repurchase price the fund would suffer a loss the fund also may experience difficulties and incur certain costs in exercising its rights to the collateral and may lose the interest the fund expected to receive under the repurchase agreement repurchase agreements usually are for short periods such as one week or less but may be longer it is the current policy of the funds to treat repurchase agreements that do not mature within seven days as illiquid for the purposes of their investments policies ��������each fund may also invest in securities issued by other investment companies that invest in high quality shortterm debt securities ie money market instruments in addition to the advisory fees and other expenses each fund bears directly in connection with its own operations as a shareholder of another investment company the fund would bear its pro rata portion of the other investment company�s advisory fees and other expenses and such fees and other expenses will be borne indirectly by the fund�s shareholders ��������rights and warrants ��������each fund may purchase rights and warrants to purchase equity securities investments in rights and warrants are pure speculation in that they have no voting rights pay no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the corporation issuing them rights and warrants basically are options to purchase equity securities at a specific price valid for a specific period of time they do not represent ownership of the securities but only the right to buy them rights and warrants differ from call options in that rights and warrants are issued by the issuer of the security which may be purchased on their exercise whereas call options may be written or issued by anyone the prices of rights if traded independently and warrants do not necessarily move parallel to the prices of the underlying securities rights and warrants involve the risk that a fund could lose the purchase value of the warrant if the warrant is not exercised prior to its expiration they also involve the risk that the effective price paid for the warrant added to the subscription price of the related security may be greater than the value of the subscribed security�s market price b ��������derivatives ��������the funds may invest in various derivatives a derivative is a financial instrument which has a value that is based on � or �derived from� � the values of other assets reference rates or indexes both of the funds may invest in derivatives for hedging purposes the active income fund will also invest in derivatives for speculative purposes the micro cap fund will not invest more than  of the value of its total assets in derivative securities the active income fund is not subject to this limitation ��������derivatives may relate to a wide variety of underlying references such as commodities stocks bonds interest rates currency exchange rates and related indexes derivatives include futures contracts and options on futures contracts see discussion below forwardcommitment transactions see discussion below on �when issued and delayeddelivery securities� options on securities see discussion below on �options on securities� caps floors collars swap agreements see discussion below on �swaps� and other financial instruments some derivatives such as futures contracts and certain options are traded on us commodity and securities exchanges while other derivatives such as swap agreements are privately negotiated and entered into in the overthecounter otc market the risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments derivatives are used by some investors for speculative purposes derivatives also may be used for a variety of purposes that do not constitute speculation such as hedging risk management seeking to stay fully invested seeking to reduce transaction costs seeking to simulate an investment in equity or debt securities or other investments seeking to add value by using derivatives to more efficiently implement portfolio positions when derivatives are favorably priced relative to equity or debt securities or other investments and for other purposes ��������derivative products are highly specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analyses different from those associated with stocks bonds and other traditional investments the use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but also of the derivative itself without the benefit of observing the performance of the derivative under all possible market conditions ��������the use of a derivative involves the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party to the contract usually referred to as a �counterparty� or the failure of the counterparty to make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the contract additionally the use of credit derivatives can result in losses if the adviser does not correctly evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuer on which the credit derivative is based ��������derivatives may be subject to liquidity risk which exists when a particular derivative is difficult to purchase or sell if a derivative transaction is particularly large or if the relevant market is illiquid as is the case with many otc derivatives it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an advantageous time or price ��������derivatives may be subject to pricing or �basis� risk which exists when a particular derivative becomes extraordinarily expensive relative to historical prices or the prices of corresponding cash market instruments under certain market conditions it may not be economically feasible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position in time to avoid a loss or take advantage of an opportunity b ��������because many derivatives have a leverage or borrowing component adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying asset reference rate or index can result in a loss substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative itself certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss regardless of the size of the initial investment while certain derivative transactions may be considered to constitute borrowing transactions such derivative transactions will not be considered to constitute the issuance of a �senior security� and therefore such transactions will not be subject to the  continuous asset coverage requirement otherwise applicable to borrowings if a fund covers the transaction or segregates sufficient liquid assets in accordance with applicable requirements ��������like most other investments derivative instruments are subject to the risk that the market value of the instrument will change in a way detrimental to a fund�s interest each fund bears the risk that the adviser will incorrectly forecast future market trends or the values of assets reference rates indices or other financial or economic factors in establishing derivative positions for the fund if the adviser attempts to use a derivative as a hedge against or as a substitute for a portfolio investment a fund will be exposed to the risk that the derivative will have or will develop imperfect or no correlation with the portfolio investment this could cause substantial losses for a fund while hedging strategies involving derivative instruments can reduce the risk of loss they can also reduce the opportunity for gain or even result in losses by offsetting favorable price movements in other investments many derivatives in particular otc derivatives are complex and often valued subjectively improper valuations can result in increased cash payment requirements to counterparties or a loss of value to a fund ��������options on securities ��������an option is a legal contract that gives the buyer who then becomes the holder the right to buy in the case of a call or sell in the case of a put a specified amount of the underlying security at the option price at any time before the option expires the buyer of a call obtains in exchange for a premium that is paid to the seller or �writer� of the call the right to purchase the underlying security the buyer of a put obtains the right to sell the underlying security to the writer of the put likewise in exchange for a premium options have standardized terms including the exercise price and expiration time listed options are traded on national securities exchanges that provide a secondary market in which holders or writers can close out their positions by offsetting sales and purchases the premium paid to a writer is not a down payment it is a nonrefundable payment from a buyer to a seller for the rights conveyed by the option a premium has two components the intrinsic value and the time value the intrinsic value represents the difference between the current price of the securities and the exercise price at which the securities will be sold pursuant to the terms of the option the time value is the sum of money investors are willing to pay for the option in the hope that at some time before expiration it will increase in value because of a change in the price of the underlying security ��������one risk of any put or call that is held is that the put or call is a wasting asset if it is not sold or exercised prior to its expiration it becomes worthless the time value component of the premium decreases as the option approaches expiration and the holder may lose all or a large part of the premium paid in addition there can be no guarantee that a liquid secondary market will exist on a given exchange in order for an option position to be closed out furthermore if trading is halted in an underlying security the trading of options is usually halted as well in the event that an option cannot be traded the only alternative to the holder is to exercise the option b ��������call options on securities when a fund writes a call it receives a premium and agrees to sell the related investments to the purchaser of the call during the call period usually not more than nine months at a fixed exercise price which may differ from the market price of the related investments regardless of market price changes during the call period if the call is exercised the fund forgoes any gain from an increase in the market price over the exercise price ��������to terminate its obligation on a call which it has written a fund may purchase a call in a �closing purchase transaction� a profit or loss will be realized depending on the amount of option transaction costs and whether the premium previously received is more or less than the price of the call purchased a profit may also be realized if the call lapses unexercised because a fund retains the premium received all call options written by a fund must be �covered� for a call to be �covered� a a fund must own the underlying security or have an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without payment of additional cash consideration b a fund must maintain cash or liquid securities adequate to purchase the security or c any combination of a or b ��������when a fund buys a call it pays a premium and has the right to buy the related investments from the seller of the call during the call period at a fixed exercise price a fund benefits only if the market price of the related investment is above the call price plus the premium paid during the call period and the call is either exercised or sold at a profit if the call is not exercised or sold whether or not at a profit it will become worthless at its expiration date and a fund will lose its premium payment and the right to purchase the related investment ��������put options on securities when a fund buys a put it pays a premium and has the right to sell the related investment to the seller of the put during the put period usually not more than nine months at a fixed exercise price buying a protective put permits a fund to protect itself during the put period against a decline in the value of the related investment below the exercise price by having the right to sell the investment through the exercise of the put ��������when a fund writes a put option it receives a premium and has the same obligations to a purchaser of such a put as are indicated above as its rights when it purchases such a put a profit or loss will be realized depending on the amount of option transaction costs and whether the premium previously received is more or less than the put purchased in a closing purchase transaction a profit may also be realized if the put lapses unexercised because a fund retains the premium received all put options written by a fund must be �covered� for a put to be �covered� a fund must maintain cash or liquid securities equal to the option price ��������futures contracts and options thereon ��������the active income fund may purchase and write sell interest ratedebt futures contracts and may purchase put and call options and write call options on interest ratedebt futures contracts a futures contract obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take delivery of the specified commodity on the expiration date of the contract an interest ratedebt futures contract obligates the active income fund to purchase or sell an amount of a specific debt security at a future date at a specific price it is the practice of holders of futures contracts to close out their positions on or before the expiration date by use of offsetting contract positions and physical delivery is thereby avoided b ��������a futures contract is a commitment to buy or sell a specific product at a currently determined market price for delivery at a predetermined future date the futures contract is uniform as to quantity quality and delivery time for a specified underlying product the commitment is executed in a designated contract market � a futures exchange � that maintains facilities for continuous trading the buyer and seller of the futures contract are both required to make a deposit of cash or us treasury bills with their brokers equal to a varying specified percentage of the contract amount the deposit is known as initial margin since ownership of the underlying product is not being transferred the margin deposit is not a down payment it is a security deposit to protect against nonperformance of the contract no credit is being extended and no interest expense accrues on the nonmargined value of the contract the contract is marked to market every day and the profits and losses resulting from the daily change are reflected in the accounts of the buyer and seller of the contract a profit in excess of the initial deposit can be withdrawn but a loss may require an additional payment known as variation margin if the loss causes the equity in the account to fall below an established maintenance level the funds will maintain cash or liquid securities sufficient to cover their obligations under each futures contract into which they enter ��������successful use of interest ratedebt futures contracts and options on interest ratedebt futures contracts by the active income fund is subject to the adviser�s ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the relevant market and to the extent the transaction is entered into for hedging purposes to ascertain the appropriate correlation between the transaction being hedged and the price movements of the futures contract for example if the active income fund uses futures to hedge against the possibility of a decline in the market value of debt instruments held in its portfolio and the prices of such securities instead increase the active income fund will lose part or all of the benefit of the increased value of the securities which it has hedged because it will have offsetting losses in its futures positions furthermore if in such circumstances the active income fund has insufficient cash it may have to sell securities to meet daily variation margin requirements the active income fund may have to sell such securities at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so ��������the micro cap fund may purchase and write sell stock index futures contracts as a substitute for a comparable market position in the underlying securities and may purchase put and call options and write call options on stock index futures contracts a stock index futures contract obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take an amount of cash equal to a specific dollar amount times the difference between the value of a specific stock index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the agreement is made no physical delivery of the underlying stocks in the index is made ��������when a fund purchases a put or call option on a futures contract the fund pays a premium for the right to sell or purchase the underlying futures contract for a specified price upon exercise at any time during the option period by writing a call option on a futures contract the fund receives a premium in return for granting to the purchaser of the option the right to buy from the fund the underlying futures contract for a specified price upon exercise at any time during the option period ��������some futures and options strategies tend to hedge a fund�s positions against price fluctuations while other strategies tend to increase market exposure the extent of a fund�s loss from an unhedged short position in futures contracts or call options on futures contracts is potentially unlimited each fund may engage in related closing transactions with respect to options on futures contracts each fund will purchase or write options only on futures contracts that are traded on a united states exchange or board of trade b ��������the trust has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term �commodity pool operator� under section  of the regulations under the commodity exchange act promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission thus the trust is not subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under the commodity exchange act ��������when a fund purchases or sells a futures contract the fund �covers� its position to cover its position the fund may maintain with its custodian bank and marktomarket on a daily basis cash or liquid securities that when added to any amounts deposited with a futures commission merchant as margin are equal to the market value of the futures contract or otherwise cover its position if the fund continues to engage in the described securities trading practices and so maintain cash or liquid securities the maintained cash or liquid securities will function as a practical limit on the amount of leverage which the fund may undertake and on the potential increase in the speculative character of the fund�s outstanding portfolio securities additionally such maintained cash or liquid securities will assure the availability of adequate funds to meet the obligations of the fund arising from such investment activities ��������each fund may cover its long position in a futures contract by purchasing a put option on the same futures contract with a strike price ie an exercise price as high or higher than the price of the futures contract or if the strike price of the put is less than the price of the futures contract the fund will maintain cash or liquid securities equal in value to the difference between the strike price of the put and the price of the futures contract the fund may also cover its long position in a futures contract by taking a short position in the instruments underlying the futures contract or by taking positions in instruments the prices of which are expected to move relatively consistently with the futures contract the fund may cover its short position in a futures contract by taking a long position in the instruments underlying the futures contract or by taking positions in instruments the prices of which are expected to move relatively consistently with the futures contract ��������each fund may cover its sale of a call option on a futures contract by taking a long position in the underlying futures contract at a price less than or equal to the strike price of the call option or if the long position in the underlying futures contract is established at a price greater than the strike price of the written call the fund will maintain cash or liquid securities equal in value to the difference between the strike price of the call and the price of the futures contract each fund may also cover its sale of a call option by taking positions in instruments the prices of which are expected to move relatively consistently with the call option ��������although each fund intends to sell futures contracts only if there is an active market for such contracts no assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any particular contract at any particular time many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the day futures contract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially subjecting a fund to substantial losses if trading is not possible or a fund determines not to close a futures position in anticipation of adverse price movements the fund will be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin the risk that a fund will be unable to close out a futures position will be minimized by entering into such transactions on a national exchange with an active and liquid secondary market b ��������special risks of hedging strategies ��������participation in the options or futures markets involves investment risks and transactions costs to which a fund would not be subject absent the use of these strategies in particular the loss from investing in futures contracts is potentially unlimited if the adviser�s prediction of movements in the securities and interest rate markets is inaccurate a fund could be in a worse position than if such strategies were not used risks inherent in the use of options futures contracts and options on futures contracts include  imperfect correlation between the price of options and futures contracts and options thereon and movements in the prices of the securities being hedged �the fact that skills needed to use these strategies are different from those needed to select portfolio securities and  the possible absence of a liquid secondary market for any particular instrument at any time ��������real estate investment trusts ��������a real estate investment trust �reit� is a corporation or a business trust that would otherwise be taxed as a corporation which meets the definitional requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the �code� the code permits a qualifying reit to deduct dividends paid thereby effectively eliminating corporate level federal income tax and making the reit a passthrough vehicle for federal income tax purposes to meet the definitional requirements of the code a reit must among other things invest substantially all of its assets in interests in real estate including mortgages and other reits or cash and government securities derive most of its income from rents from real property or interest on loans secured by mortgages on real property and distribute to shareholders annually a substantial portion of its otherwise taxable income ��������reits are characterized as equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits equity reits which may include operating or finance companies own real estate directly and the value of and income earned by the reits depend upon the income of the underlying properties and the rental income they earn equity reits also can realize capital gains or losses by selling properties that have appreciated or depreciated in value mortgage reits can make construction development or longterm mortgage loans and are sensitive to the credit quality of the borrower mortgage reits derive their income from interest payments on such loans hybrid reits combine the characteristics of both equity and mortgage reits generally by holding both ownership interests and mortgage interests in real estate the value of securities issued by reits are affected by tax and regulatory requirements and by perceptions of management skill they also are subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers or tenants selfliquidation and the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree status under the code or to maintain exemption from the  act ��������foreign securities ��������each of the funds may invest in securities of foreign issuers each of the funds may also hold securities of us and foreign issuers in the form of american depository receipts �adrs� or american depository shares �adss� and they may each invest in securities of foreign issuers traded directly in the us securities markets investments in foreign securities involve special risks and considerations that are not present when the funds invests in domestic securities as an operating policy the micro cap fund may only purchase securities of foreign issuers and adrs and adss up to a maximum of  of the value of its total net assets and the active income fund may invest up to  of its total assets in bonds issued by foreign issuers that are us dollardenominated and up to  of its total assets in bonds of foreign issuers denominated in foreign currencies b ��������the active income fund may invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by one or more foreign governments or any of their political subdivisions agencies or instrumentalities that are determined by the adviser to be of comparable quality to the other obligations in which the active income fund may invest such securities also include debt obligations of supranational entities supranational entities include international organizations designated or supported by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or development and international banking institutions and related government agencies examples include the international bank for reconstruction and development the world bank the european coal and steel community the asian development bank and the interamerican development bank ��������the value of the funds� foreign investments may be significantly affected by changes in currency exchange rates and the funds may incur certain costs in converting securities denominated in foreign currencies to us dollars in many countries there is less publicly available information about issuers than is available in the reports and ratings published about companies in the united states additionally foreign companies are not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards dividends and interest on foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes which would reduce the funds� income without providing a tax credit for the funds� shareholders although the funds intend to invest in securities of foreign issuers domiciled in nations which the adviser considers as having stable and friendly governments there is a possibility of expropriation confiscatory taxation currency blockage or political or social instability which could affect investments in those nations ��������limitations on options and futures ��������transactions in options by a fund will be subject to limitations established by each of the exchanges governing the maximum number of options which may be written or held by a single investor or group of investors acting in concert regardless of whether the options are written or held on the same or different exchanges or are written or held in one or more accounts or through one or more brokers thus the number of options which a fund may write or hold may be affected by options written or held by other investment advisory clients of the adviser and its affiliates position limits also apply to futures contracts an exchange may order the liquidations of positions found to be in excess of these limits and it may impose certain sanctions nonprincipal investment strategies and risks specific to the active income fund ��������convertible securities ��������the active income fund may invest in convertible debt securities the active income fund may also invest in common or preferred stock as a means of realizing the economic value associated with owning convertible securities convertible securities are bonds or preferred stocks that may be converted exchanged into common stock of the issuing company within a certain period of time for a specified number of shares b ��������duration and portfolio maturity ��������the active income fund invests without regard to maturity or duration limitations as a measure of a fixedincome security�s cash flow duration is an alternative to the concept of �term to maturity� in assessing the price volatility associated with changes in interest rates generally the longer the duration the more volatility an investor should expect for example the market price of a bond with a duration of three years would be expected to decline  if interest rates rose  conversely the market price of the same bond would be expected to increase  if interest rates fell  the market price of a bond with a duration of six years would be expected to increase or decline twice as much as the market price of a bond with a threeyear duration duration is a way of measuring a security�s maturity in terms of the average time required to receive the present value of all interest and principal payments as opposed to its term to maturity the maturity of a security measures only the time until final payment is due it does not take account of the pattern of a security�s cash flows over time which would include how cash flow is affected by prepayments and by changes in interest rates incorporating a security�s yield coupon interest payments final maturity and option features into one measure duration is computed by determining the weighted average maturity of a bond�s cash flows where the present values of the cash flows serve as weights in computing the duration of the active income fund the adviser will estimate the duration of obligations that are subject to features such as prepayment or redemption by the issuer put options retained by the investor or other imbedded options taking into account the influence of interest rates on prepayments and coupon flows the adviser will adjust the duration and maturity of the active income fund�s portfolio based on the adviser�s interest rate outlook ��������swaps ��������a swap agreement is a derivative that is subject to the risks discussed above in �derivatives� a swap agreement is an agreement between two parties counterparties to exchange payments at specified dates periodic payment dates on the basis of a specified amount notional amount with the payments calculated with reference to a specified asset reference rate or index ��������examples of swap agreements include but are not limited to interest rate swaps credit default swaps equity swaps commodity swaps foreign currency swaps index swaps and total return swaps forms of swap agreements include interest rate caps under which in return for a premium one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates exceed a specified rate or �cap� interest rate floors under which in return for a premium one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates fall below a specified level or �floor� and interest rate collars under which a party sells a cap and purchases a floor or vice versa in an attempt to protect itself against interest rate movements exceeding given minimum levels most swap agreements provide that when the periodic payment dates for both parties are the same payments are netted and only the net amount is paid to the counterparty entitled to receive the net payment consequently the active income fund�s current obligations or rights under a swap agreement will generally be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each counterparty swap agreements allow for a wide variety of transactions for example fixed rate payments may be exchanged for floating rate payments us dollardenominated payments may be exchanged for payments denominated in a different currency and payments tied to the price of one asset reference rate or index may be exchanged for payments tied to the price of another asset reference rate or index b ��������an option on a swap agreement also called a �swaption� is an option that gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap on a future date in exchange for paying a marketbased �premium� a receiver swaption gives the owner the right to receive the total return of a specified asset reference rate or index a payer swaption gives the owner the right to pay the total return of a specified asset reference rate or index swaptions also include options that allow an existing swap to be terminated or extended by one of the counterparties ��������the swaps market is largely unregulated it is possible that developments in the swaps market including potential government regulation could adversely affect the active income fund�s ability to terminate existing swap agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements ��������reverse repurchase agreements ��������the active income fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements are considered to be borrowings under the  act and as such are subject to the investment limitations discussed in the section entitled �borrowing� under a reverse repurchase agreement the active income fund sells portfolio securities and agrees to repurchase them at an agreedupon future date and price when the active income fund enters into a reverse repurchase agreement it will maintain cash or liquid securities having a value equal to or greater than the repurchase price including accrued interest reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the securities sold by the active income fund may decline below the price of the securities it is obligated to repurchase ��������when issued and delayeddelivery securities ��������to ensure the availability of suitable securities for its portfolio the active income fund may purchase whenissued or delayed delivery securities whenissued transactions arise when securities are purchased by the active income fund with payment and delivery taking place in the future in order to secure what is considered to be an advantageous price and yield to the fund at the time of entering into the transaction whenissued securities represent securities that have been authorized but not yet issued the active income fund may also purchase securities on a forward commitment or delayed delivery basis in a forward commitment transaction the active income fund contracts to purchase securities for a fixed price at a future date beyond customary settlement time the active income fund is required to hold and maintain until the settlement date cash or other liquid assets in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase price alternatively the active income fund may enter into offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other securities that it owns the purchase of securities on a whenissued or forward commitment basis involves a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased declines prior to the settlement date ��������us government securities ��������the active income fund may invest in a variety of us treasury obligations including bills notes and bonds these obligations differ only in terms of their interest rates maturities and time of issuance the active income fund may also invest in other securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies and instrumentalities b ��������obligations of certain agencies and instrumentalities such as the government national mortgage association �ginnie mae� are supported by the full faith and credit of the us treasury others such as those of the exportimport bank of the united states are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury and others such as those of the federal national mortgage association �fannie mae� are supported by the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase the agency�s obligations still others such as those of the student loan marketing association �sallie mae� are supported only by the credit of the agency or instrumentality that issues them there is no guarantee that the us government will provide financial support to its agencies or instrumentalities now or in the future if it is not obligated to do so by law ��������inflationindexed bonds ��������the active income fund may invest in inflationindexed bonds which are fixedincome securities whose value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation two structures are common the us treasury and some other issuers utilize a structure that accrues inflation into the principal value of the bond most other issuers pay out the inflation accruals as part of a semiannual coupon ��������inflationindexed securities issued by the us treasury have varying maturities and pay interest on a semiannual basis equal to a fixed percentage of the inflationadjusted principal amount if the periodic adjustment rate measuring inflation falls the principal value of inflationindexed bonds will be adjusted downward and consequently the interest payable on these securities calculated with respect to a smaller principal amount will be reduced repayment of the original bond principal upon maturity as adjusted for inflation is guaranteed in the case of us treasury inflationindexed bonds even during a period of deflation however the current market value of the bonds is not guaranteed and will fluctuate the active income fund also may invest in other inflationrelated bonds that may or may not provide a similar guarantee if a guarantee of principal is not provided the adjusted principal value of the bond repaid at maturity may be less than the original principal amount ��������the value of inflationindexed bonds is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates real interest rates in turn are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation therefore if the rate of inflation rises at a faster rate than nominal interest rates real interest rates might decline leading to an increase in value of inflationindexed bonds in contrast if nominal interest rates increase at a faster rate than inflation real interest rates might rise leading to a decrease in value of inflationindexed bonds any increase in the principal amount of an inflationindexed bond will be considered taxable ordinary income even though investors do not receive their principal until maturity ��������while these securities are expected to be protected from longterm inflationary trends shortterm increases in inflation may lead to a decline in value if interest rates rise due to reasons other than inflation for example due to changes in currency exchange rates investors in these securities may not be protected to the extent that the increase is not reflected in the bond�s inflation measure b ��������the periodic adjustment of us inflationindexed bonds is tied to the consumer price index for urban consumers �cpiu� which is calculated monthly by the us bureau of labor statistics the cpiu is a measurement of changes in the cost of living made up of components such as housing food transportation and energy inflationindexed bonds issued by a foreign government are generally adjusted to reflect a comparable inflation index calculated by that government there can be no assurance that the cpiu or any foreign inflation index will accurately measure the real rate of inflation in the prices of goods and services moreover there can be no assurance that the rate of inflation in a foreign country will be correlated to the rate of inflation in the united states ��������mortgagebacked securities and other assetbacked securities ��������the active income fund may invest in mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities ie securities backed by credit card receivables automobile loans or other assets mortgagebacked securities are securities that directly or indirectly represent a participation in or are secured by and payable from mortgage loans secured by real property mortgagebacked securities include �government agency mortgagebacked securities �privatelyissued mortgagebacked securities and �collateralized mortgage obligations and multiclass passthrough securities ��������government agency mortgagebacked securities mortgagebacked securities include government agency mortgagebacked securities which represent participation interests in pools of residential mortgage loans originated by united states governmental or private lenders and guaranteed to the extent provided in such securities by the united states government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities such securities with the exception of collateralized mortgage obligations are ownership interests in the underlying mortgage loans and provide for monthly payments that are a �passthrough� of the monthly interest and principal payments including any prepayments made by the individual borrowers on the pooled mortgage loans net of any fees paid to the guarantor of such securities and the servicer of the underlying mortgage loans ��������the government agency mortgagebacked securities in which the active income fund may invest will include those issued or guaranteed

fannie mae acquires funds to purchase home mortgage loans from many capital market investors that ordinarily may not invest in mortgage loans directly thereby expanding the total amount of funds available for housing ��������each fannie mae certificate entitles the registered holder thereof to receive amounts representing such holder�s pro rata interest in scheduled principal payments and interest payments at such fannie mae certificate�s passthrough rate which is net of any servicing and guarantee fees on the underlying mortgage loans and any principal prepayments on the mortgage loans in the pool represented by such fannie mae certificate and such holder�s proportionate interest in the full principal amount of any foreclosed or otherwise finally liquidated mortgage loan the full and timely payment of principal of and interest on each fannie mae certificate will be guaranteed by fannie mae which guarantee is not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government ��������freddie mac certificates freddie mac is a corporate instrumentality of the united states created pursuant to the emergency home finance act of  as amended the �fhlmc act� freddie mac was established primarily for the purpose of increasing the availability of mortgage credit for the financing of needed housing the principal activity of freddie mac currently consists of the purchase of first lien conventional residential mortgage loans and participation interests in such mortgage loans and the resale of the mortgage loans so purchased in the form of mortgage securities primarily freddie mac certificates ��������freddie mac guarantees to each registered holder of a freddie mac certificate the timely payment of interest at the rate provided for by such freddie mac certificate whether or not received freddie mac also guarantees to each registered holder of a freddie mac certificate ultimate collection of all principal of the related mortgage loans without any offset or deduction but generally does not guarantee the timely payment of scheduled principal freddie mac may remit the amount due on account of its guarantee of collection of principal at any time after default on an underlying mortgage loan but not later than  days following i�foreclosure sale ii�payment of claim by any mortgage insurer or iii�the expiration of any right of redemption whichever occurs later but in any event no later than one year after demand has been made upon the mortgagor for accelerated payment of principal the obligations of freddie mac under its guarantee are obligations solely of freddie mac and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government ��������privatelyissued mortgagebacked securities privatelyissued mortgagebacked securities are issued by private issuers and represent an interest in or are collateralized by i�mortgagebacked securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities �privatelyissued agency mortgagebacked securities� or ii�whole mortgage loans or nonagency collateralized mortgagebacked securities �privatelyissued nonagency mortgagebacked securities� these securities are structured similarly to the ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage passthrough securities described above and are issued by originators of and investors in mortgage loans including savings and loan associations mortgage banks commercial banks investment banks and special purpose subsidiaries of the foregoing privatelyissued agency mortgagebacked securities usually are backed by a pool of ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac certificates privatelyissued nonagency mortgagebacked securities usually are backed by a pool of conventional fixed rate or adjustable rate mortgage loans that are not guaranteed by an entity having the credit status of ginnie mae fannie mae or freddie mac and generally are structured with one or more types of credit enhancement as more fully described below these securities may include collateralized mortgage obligations and multiclass passthrough securities b ��������the active income fund may invest in subordinated privatelyissued nonagency mortgagebacked securities �subordinated securities� subordinated securities have no governmental guarantee and are subordinated in some manner as to the payment of principal andor interest to the holders of more senior privatelyissued nonagency mortgagebacked securities the holders of subordinated securities typically are compensated with a higher stated yield than are the holders of more senior privatelyissued nonagency mortgagebacked securities on the other hand subordinated securities typically subject the holder to greater risk than senior privatelyissued nonagency mortgagebacked securities and tend to be rated in a lower rating category and frequently a substantially lower rating category than the senior privatelyissued nonagency mortgagebacked securities subordinated securities generally are likely to be more sensitive to changes in prepayment and interest rates and the market for such securities may be less liquid than is the case for traditional fixedincome securities and senior privatelyissued nonagency mortgagebacked securities ��������collateralized mortgage obligations and multiclass passthrough securities mortgagebacked securities include collateralized mortgage obligations or �cmos� which are debt obligations collateralized by mortgage loans or mortgage passthrough securities typically cmos are collateralized by ginnie mae fannie mae or freddie mac certificates but also may be collateralized by other mortgagebacked securities or whole loans such collateral collectively hereinafter referred to as �mortgage assets� cmos include multiclass passthrough securities which can be equity interests in a trust composed of mortgage assets payments of principal of and interest on the mortgage assets and any reinvestment income thereon provide the funds to pay debt service on the cmos or make scheduled distributions on the multiclass passthrough securities cmos may be issued by agencies or instrumentalities of the us government or by private originators of or investors in mortgage loans including savings and loan associations mortgage banks commercial banks investment banks and special purpose subsidiaries of the foregoing the issuer of a series of cmos may elect to be treated as a real estate mortgage investment conduit ��������in a cmo a series of bonds or certificates is issued in multiple classes each class of cmos often referred to as a �tranche� is issued at a specific fixed or floating coupon rate and has a stated maturity or final distribution date principal prepayments on the mortgage assets may cause the cmos to be retired substantially earlier than their stated maturities or final distribution dates interest is paid or accrues on classes of the cmos on a monthly quarterly or semiannual basis the principal of and interest on the mortgage assets may be allocated among the several classes of a cmo series in innumerable ways some of which bear substantially more risk than others in particular certain classes of cmos and other types of mortgage passthrough securities including interest only classes principal only classes inverse floaters z or accrual classes and companion classes are designed to be highly sensitive to changes in prepayment and interest rates and can subject the holder to extreme reductions of yield and loss of principal the active income fund may invest in such highrisk derivative mortgagebacked securities b ��������stripped mortgagebacked securities the active income fund may invest in stripped mortgagebacked securities issued by the us government �smbs� smbs are usually structured with two classes that receive different proportions of the interest and principal distributions from a pool of mortgage assets a common type of smbs will have one class receiving all of the interest from the mortgage assets while the other class will receive all of the principal however in some instances one class will receive some of the interest and most of the principal while the other class will receive most of the interest and the remainder of the principal if the underlying mortgage assets experience greater than anticipated prepayments of principal the active income fund may fail to fully recover its initial investment in these securities the market value of the class consisting entirely of principal payments generally is unusually volatile in response to changes in interest rates the yield on a class of smbs that receives all or most of the interest from mortgage assets are generally higher than prevailing market yields on other mortgagebacked securities because their cash flow patterns are more volatile and there is a greater risk that the initial investment will not be fully recouped ��������adjustablerate mortgage loans certain mortgage loans underlying the mortgagebacked securities in which the active income fund may invest will be adjustable rate mortgage loans �arms� arms eligible for inclusion in a mortgage pool will generally provide for a fixed initial mortgage interest rate for a specified period of time thereafter the interest rates the �mortgage interest rates� may be subject to periodic adjustment based on changes in the applicable index rate the �index rate� the adjusted rate would be equal to the index rate plus a gross margin which is a fixed percentage spread over the index rate established for each arm at the time of its origination ��������there are various types of indices which provide the basis for rate adjustments on arms commonly utilized indices include the oneyear threeyear and fiveyear constant maturity treasury rates the threemonth treasury bill rate the day treasury bill rate rates on longerterm treasury securities the th district federal home loan bank cost of funds the national median cost of funds the onemonth threemonth sixmonth or one year libor the prime rate of a specific bank or commercial paper rates some indices such as the oneyear constant maturity treasury rate closely mirror changes in market interest rate levels others such as the th district federal home loan bank cost of funds index tend to lag behind changes in market rate levels and tend to be somewhat less volatile the degree of volatility in the market value of the active income fund�s portfolio and therefore in the nav of the active income fund�s shares will be a function of the length of the interest rate reset periods and the degree of volatility in the applicable indices ��������adjustable interest rates can cause payment increases that some mortgagors may find difficult to make however certain arms may provide that the mortgage interest rate may not be adjusted to a rate above an applicable lifetime maximum rate or below an applicable lifetime minimum rate for such arms certain arms may also be subject to limitations on the maximum amount by which the mortgage interest rate may adjust for any single adjustment period the �maximum adjustment� other arms �negatively amortizing arms� may provide instead or as well for limitations on changes in the monthly payment on such arms limitations on monthly payments can result in monthly payments which are greater or less than the amount necessary to amortize a negatively amortizing arm by its maturity at the mortgage interest rate in effect in any particular month in the event that a monthly payment is not sufficient to pay the interest accruing on a negatively amortizing arm any such excess interest is added to the principal balance of the loan causing negative amortization and is repaid through future monthly payments it may take borrowers under negatively amortizing arms longer periods of time to achieve equity and may increase the likelihood of default by such borrowers in the event that a monthly payment exceeds the sum of the interest accrued at the applicable mortgage interest rate and the principal payment which would have been necessary to amortize the outstanding principal balance over the remaining term of the loan the excess or �accelerated amortization� further reduces the principal balance of the arm negatively amortizing arms do not provide for the extension of their original maturity to accommodate changes in their mortgage interest rate as a result unless there is a periodic recalculation of the payment amount which there generally is the final payment may be substantially larger than the other payments these limitations on periodic increases in interest rates and on changes in monthly payments protect borrowers from unlimited interest rate and payment increases b ��������assetbacked securities  assetbacked securities may involve certain risks that are not presented by mortgagebacked securities arising primarily from the nature of the underlying assets ie credit card and automobile loan receivables as opposed to real estate mortgages nonmortgage assetbacked securities do not have the benefit of the same security interest in the collateral as mortgagebacked securities credit card receivables are generally unsecured and the debtors are entitled to the protection of a number of state and federal consumer credit laws many of which have given debtors the right to reduce the balance due on the credit cards most issuers of automobile receivables permit the servicers to retain possession of the underlying obligations if the servicer were to sell these obligations to another party there is the risk that the purchaser would acquire an interest superior to that of the holders of related automobile receivables in addition because of the large number of vehicles involved in a typical issuance and technical requirements under state laws the trustee for the holders of the automobile receivables may not have an effective security interest in all of the obligations backing such receivables therefore there is a possibility that payments on the receivables together with recoveries on repossessed collateral may not in some cases be able to support payments on these securities ��������assetbacked securities may be subject to greater risk of default during periods of economic downturn than other instruments also while the secondary market for assetbacked securities is ordinarily quite liquid in times of financial stress the secondary market may not be as liquid as the market for other types of securities which could cause the active income fund to experience difficulty in valuing or liquidating such securities ��������miscellaneous the yield characteristics of mortgagebacked securities differ from traditional debt securities among the major differences are that interest and principal payments are made more frequently usually monthly and that principal may be prepaid at any time because the underlying mortgage loans generally may be prepaid at any time as a result if the active income fund purchases such a security at a premium a prepayment rate that is faster than expected will reduce yield to maturity while a prepayment rate that is slower than expected will have the opposite effect of increasing yield to maturity conversely if the active income fund purchases these securities at a discount faster than expected prepayments will increase while slower than expected prepayments will reduce yield to maturity certain classes of cmos and other types of mortgage passthrough securities including those whose interest rates fluctuate based on multiples of a stated index are designed to be highly sensitive to changes in prepayment and interest rates and can subject the holders thereof to extreme reductions of yield and possibly loss of principal b ��������prepayments on a pool of mortgage loans are influenced by a variety of economic geographic social and other factors including changes in the mortgagors� housing needs job transfers unemployment mortgagors� net equity in the mortgaged properties and servicing decisions generally however prepayments on fixed rate mortgage loans will increase during a period of falling interest rates and decrease during a period of rising interest rates accordingly amounts available for reinvestment by the active income fund are likely to be greater during a period of declining interest rates and as a result likely to be reinvested at lower interest rates than during a period of rising interest rates mortgagebacked securities may decrease in value as a result of increases in interest rates and may benefit less than other fixed income securities from declining interest rates because of the risk of prepayment ��������no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the market for certain mortgagebacked securities such as cmos and multiclass passthrough securities determination as to the liquidity of such securities will be made in accordance with guidelines established by the trust�s board of trustees in accordance with such guidelines the adviser will monitor the active income fund�s investments in such securities with particular regard to trading activity availability of reliable price information and other relevant information ��������mortgage dollar rolls ��������the active income fund may enter into mortgage �dollar rolls� in which the active income fund sells mortgagebacked securities for delivery in the current month and simultaneously contracts to repurchase substantially similar same type coupon and maturity securities on a specified future date during the roll period the active income fund foregoes principal and interest paid on the mortgagebacked securities the active income fund is compensated by the difference between the current sales price and the lower forward price for the future purchase often referred to as the �drop� as well as by the interest earned on the cash proceeds of the initial sale a �covered roll� is a dollar roll for which there is an offsetting cash or liquid security position the active income fund will only enter into covered rolls covered rolls are not treated as a borrowing or other senior security and will be excluded from the calculation of the active income funds� borrowings and other senior securities ��������foreign currency transactions ��������the active income fund may engage in foreign currency transactions on a spot cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies at a future date �forward foreign currency� contracts or �forward� contracts the active income fund may enter into foreign currency transactions for any purpose consistent with the fund�s investment objectives such as seeking opportunities for income and capital gains ��������a forward foreign currency contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract these contracts are principally traded in the interbank market conducted directly between currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers a forward contract generally has no deposit requirement and no commissions are charged at any stage for trades b ��������although the active income fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis the active income fund will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they realize a profit based on the difference the �spread� between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to the active income fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the active income fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer ��������the active income fund may purchase and sell currency futures and purchase and write currency options to increase or decrease its exposure to different foreign currencies the uses and risks of currency options and futures are similar to options and futures relating to securities or indices as discussed above currency futures contracts are similar to forward foreign currency contracts except that they are traded on exchanges and have margin requirements and are standardized as to contract size and delivery date most currency futures contracts call for payment or delivery in us dollars the underlying instrument of a currency option may be a foreign currency which generally is purchased or delivered in exchange for us dollars or may be a futures contract the purchaser of a currency call obtains the right to purchase the underlying currency and the purchaser of a currency put obtains the right to sell the underlying currency ��������currency futures and options values can be expected to correlate with exchange rates but may not reflect other factors that affect the value of the active income fund�s investments a currency hedge for example should protect a yendominated security from a decline in the yen but will not protect the active income fund against a price decline resulting from deterioration in the issuer�s creditworthiness in hedging transactions the value of the active income fund�s foreigndenominated investments may change in response to many factors other than exchange rates in which case it may not be possible to match the amount of currency options and futures to the value of the active income fund�s investments exactly over time portfolio turnover ��������the portfolio turnover rate of the micro cap fund may vary significantly from year to year but as indicated in the prospectus it is anticipated though not assured that the annual portfolio turnover rate of the fund will not significantly exceed  a turnover rate of  would result in higher transaction costs such as brokerage commissions or markups or markdowns which the micro cap fund would have to pay and would increase realized gains or losses to investors which would likely lower the micro cap fund�s aftertax performance ��������the active income fund will engage in shortterm trading which will likely result in the active income fund�s portfolio turnover exceeding  per year this will produce higher transaction costs such as brokerage commissions or markups or markdowns which the active income fund must pay and will increase realized gains or losses to investors which may lower the active income fund�s aftertax performance b disclosure of portfolio holdings ��������the funds maintain written policies and procedures as described below regarding the disclosure of their portfolio holdings to ensure that disclosure of information about portfolio securities is in the best interests of the funds� shareholders the funds� chief compliance officer will report annually to the board of trustees with respect to compliance with the portfolio holdings disclosure procedures described herein ��������the officers of the funds receive reports on a regular basis as to any purchases and redemptions of shares of the funds and review these reports to determine if there is any unusual trading in shares of the funds the officers of the funds will report to the board of trustees any such unusual trading in shares of the funds ��������there may be instances where the interests of the shareholders of the funds respecting the disclosure of information about portfolio securities may conflict with the interests of the adviser or an affiliated person of the funds in such situations the board of trustees will be afforded the opportunity to determine whether or not to allow such disclosure the funds do not receive any compensation for providing information about their portfolio holdings ��������fund service providers ��������the funds have entered into arrangements with certain third party service providers for services that require these groups to have access to the funds� portfolio holdings as a result of the ongoing services that these service providers provide they will receive portfolio holdings information prior to and more frequently than the public disclosure of such information in each case the funds� board of trustees has determined that such advance disclosure is supported by a legitimate business purpose and that the recipient by reason of the federal securities laws  is prohibited as an �insider� from trading on the information and  has a duty of confidence to the funds because the recipient has a history and practice of sharing confidences such that the recipient of the information knows or reasonably should know that the funds expect that the recipient will maintain its confidentiality these third party service providers are the adviser and the funds� administrator independent registered public accountants and custodian ��������rating and ranking organizations ��������the funds� board of trustees has determined that the funds may provide their portfolio holdings to the rating and ranking organizations listed below on either a monthly or quarterly basis � us bancorp fund services llc morningstar inc lipper inc standard  poor�s ratings group bloomberg lp ��������the determination was made that these organizations provide investors with a valuable service and therefore it is in the best interests of the funds� shareholders to provide them with nonpublic portfolio holdings information since this information is not provided on the condition that it be kept confidential or that these organizations not trade on the information such disclosure could provide these organizations with the ability to make advantageous decisions to place orders for shares of the funds or to trade against the funds to the detriment of other shareholders of the funds however the funds will not provide this information until such information is at least  days old after which time the disclosure of such nonpublic portfolio holdings should not be problematic also as noted above the officers of the funds receive and review reports on a regular basis as to any purchases and redemptions of shares of the funds to determine if there is any unusual trading in shares of the funds the funds will not pay these organizations b

sets forth its proxy voting policies and procedures the adviser�s proxy voting process is dynamic and subject to periodic review and in its discretion the adviser may revise the proxy voting policies in response to its review the primary objective of the adviser is to vote proxies in the manner that it believes will do the most to maximize the value of the funds� investments the adviser will likely vote against any management proposals that the adviser believes could prevent companies from realizing their maximum market value or would insulate companies andor management from accountability to shareholders or prudent regulatory compliance the adviser will exercise its voting responsibilities in a manner that is consistent with the general antifraud provisions of the  act as well as the adviser�s fiduciary duties under the federal and state law to act in the best interests of the funds b ��������the discussion that follows sets forth the adviser�s proxy voting policies and procedures regarding specific types of proposals ��������proposals respecting business operations generally the adviser will vote proxies in favor of proposals that are standard and involve necessary aspects of business operations unless the adviser�s analysis of the proposal indicates that the proposal is not in the best interests of the fund in question as a shareholder of the company among factors that the adviser will consider in reviewing these proposals include the financial performance of the company the attendance and independence of the company�s board members and committees and the company�s enforcement of strict accounting practices by way of example proposals respecting standard business operations include the following � � name changes � � election of directors � � ratification of auditors � � maintaining current levels of directors� indemnification and liability � � increases in authorized shares common stock only if there is no intention to significantly dilute shareholders proportionate interests and � � employee stock purchase or ownership plans ��������proposals respecting changes in status the adviser will vote proxies on proposals that change the status of the company its individual securities or the ownership status of the securities in a manner that in the adviser�s professional investment judgment best benefits the financial and economic interests of the fund in question by way of example proposals respecting changes in status include the following � � mergers acquisitions restructurings � � reincorporations and � � changes in capitalization ��������proposals respecting shareholder democracy generally the adviser will vote proxies against any proposal that attempts to limit shareholder democracy in a way that could restrict the ability of shareholders to realize the value of their investment by way of example this would include proposals endorsing or facilitating � � increased indemnification protections for directors or officers � � certain supermajority requirements � � unequal voting rights � � classified boards b � � cumulative voting � � authorization of new securities if intention appears to be to unduly dilute shareholders proportionate interests and � � authorization to change state of incorporation if intention appears to disfavor the economic interest of the shareholders ��������generally the adviser will vote proxies in favor of any proposal that maintains or expands shareholder democracy by way of example this would include proposals that require � � annual elections � � independent directors � � confidential voting and � � shareholder approval for � � elimination of cumulative voting or preemptive rights or � � reclassification of company boards ��������proposals respecting compensation the adviser will vote proxies on proposals respecting compensation in a manner that in the adviser�s professional investment judgment best benefits the financial and economic interests of the fund in question the adviser believes that reasonable compensation is appropriate for directors executives and employees and that compensation should be used to align the interests of the involved parties with the longterm financial success of the company but that compensation should not be excessive among the factors that the adviser will consider are the potential dilution of outstanding shares whether a plan has broadbased participation and whether a plan allows for the repricing of options ��������proposals respecting social environmental and other such matters the adviser will vote proxies on proposals respecting social environmental and issues of conscience impacting the business conduct of a company in a manner that in the adviser�s professional investment judgment best benefits the financial and economic interests of the fund in question ��������if the adviser determines that voting a particular proxy would create a conflict of interest between the interests of the fund in question and its shareholders on the one hand and the interests of the adviser the fund�s distributor or any affiliate of the fund the adviser or the fund�s distributor on the other hand then the adviser will take one or some of the following steps in its sole discretion i inform the fund of the conflict and the adviser�s voting decision ii discuss the proxy vote with the fund iii fully disclose the material facts regarding the conflict and seek the fund�s consent to vote the proxy as intended andor iv seek the recommendations of an independent third party whenever the adviser determines there is a potential for a material conflict of interest the adviser will document which step or steps it took to ensure the proxy vote or abstention was in the best interest of the fund in question and not the product of any material conflict b code of ethics ��������each of the trust and the adviser have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to rule�j under the  act each code of ethics

opinion of the likelihood of timely payment of debt considered shortterm in the relevant market ratings are graded into several categories ranging from a for the highest quality obligations to d for the lowest the three highest categories are as follows ��������a this highest category indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely payment is strong those issuers determined to possess extremely strong safety characteristics are denoted with a plus sign  designation b ��������a capacity for timely payment on issues with this designation is satisfactory however the relative degree of

issuers rated prime or supporting institutions have a superior ability for repayment of senior shortterm debt obligations prime repayment ability will often be evidenced by many of the following characteristics �  leading market positions in wellestablished industries �  high rates of return on funds employed �  conservative capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt and ample asset protection �  broad margins in earnings coverage of fixed financial charges and high internal cash generation �  wellestablished access to a range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate liquidity ��������prime � issuers rated prime or supporting institutions have a strong ability for repayment of senior shortterm debt obligations this will normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser degree earnings trends and coverage ratios while sound may be more subject to variation capitalization characteristics while still appropriate may be more affected by external conditions ample alternate liquidity is maintained ��������prime � issuers rated prime or supporting institutions have an acceptable ability for repayment of senior shortterm obligations the effect of industry characteristics and market compositions may be more pronounced variability in earnings and profitability may result in changes in the level of debt protection measurements and may require relatively high financial leverage adequate alternate liquidity is maintained corporate longterm debt ratings ��������standard  poor�s debt ratings a standard� poor�s corporate debt rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation it takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers

poor�s does not perform any audit in connection with any rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other circumstances ��������the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations �  likelihood of payment � capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation �  nature of and provisions of the obligation and �  protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors� rights ��������the issue ratings definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy investment grade ���������aaa� this is the highest rating that may be assigned by standard  poor�s to a debt instrument and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay the debt

�aaa� ���������a� an issued rated �a� is backed by a sound capacity to pay the debt obligations although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions ���������bbb� an issue rated �bbb� is regarded as backed by an adequate capacity to pay the debt obligations whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to make payments for debt in this category than for issues in the �a� category speculative grade ��������debt rated

� debt rated �bb� has less nearterm vulnerability to default than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions

�ccc� rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied �b� or �b� rating ���������cc� � debt rated �cc� typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied �ccc� rating ���������c� � debt rated �c� typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt which is assigned an actual or implied �ccc� debt rating the �c� rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed but debt service payments are continued ���������ci� � the rating �ci� is reserved for income bonds on which no interest is being paid ���������d� � debt rated �d� is in payment default the �d� rating category is used when interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poor�s believes that such payments will be made during such period the �d� rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition if debt service payments are jeopardized ��������moody�s longterm debt ratings moody�s ratings are opinions not recommendations to buy or sell and their accuracy is not guaranteed ���������aaa� bonds which are rated �aaa� are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as �gilt edged� interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues b ���������aa� bonds which are �aa� are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the �aaa� group they comprise what are generally known as highgrade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in �aaa� securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in �aaa� securities ���������a� bonds which are rated �a� possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as uppermedium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future ���������baa� bonds which are rated �baa� are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well ���������ba� bonds which are rated �ba� are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as wellassured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class ���������b� bonds which are rated �b� generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small ���������caa� bonds which are rated �caa� are of poor standing such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest ���������ca� bonds which are rated �ca� represent obligations which are speculative in a high degree such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings ���������c� bonds which are rated �c� are the lowest rated class of bonds and issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any real investment standing ��������moody�s applies numerical modifiers   and  in each of the foregoing generic rating classifications the modifier  indicates that the company ranks in the higher end of
