executing our investment strategy     • a limited pool of prospective target businesses     • our ability to pay distributions on our shares of common stock     • an economic downturn which could impair our target companies’ abilities to continue to operate which could lead to the loss of some or all of our assets and     • changes in general economic or business conditions or economic or demographic trends in the united states   our actual results performance prospects or opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our forwardlooking statements in light of these risks uncertainties and assumptions you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are made as of the date of this form q we undertake no

forwardlooking statements and projections contained in this quarterly report on form q are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by section a of the securities act of    overview   we intend to invest in discounted corporate debt and equitylinked debt securities of public and private companies whose securities trade on the secondary loan market for institutional investors and provide distributions to investors at the same time we will actively work with the target company’s management to restructure the underlying securities and improve the liquidity position of the target company’s balance sheet we will employ a proprietary “cooptivist tm ” approach “cooperative activism” cooptivist tm is a registered trademark of vii peaks capital llc or vii peaks and is being used with their permission in executing our investment strategy which entails proactively engaging the target company management on average  months prior to a redemption event typically a put or maturity event to create an opportunity for growth in the investments our strategy is not dependent on restructuring to generate distributions   our investment objectives are to generate current income and capital appreciation we intend to meet our investment objectives by i realizing income and capital appreciation through the acquisition management and orderly liquidation of corporate debt securities ii making distributions of available distributable cash to our shareholders and iii preserving the capital investments of our shareholders        our proprietary “cooptivist tm” cooperative activism approach entails investment in the corporate debt and equitylinked debt securities of target companies or target investments in conjunction with proactively engaging the target companies’ management we intend to acquire target investments whose debt securities trade on the overthecounter market for institutional loans at a discount to their par redemption value and will be subject to a “redemption event” within on average  months we define a “redemption event” as a maturity event or a put event where investors in the target company’s debt security can have a redemption right at a predetermined price we intend to hold such debt an average of  –  months during which time we anticipate working actively with the target company’s management to effect andor participate in a restructuring or exchange of the invested securities for new securities   we will make investments in target companies that meet our investment criteria the size of an individual investment will vary based on numerous factors including the amount of funds raised in this offering however assuming we raise the maximum offering amount of  million we expect to hold at least  investments and we anticipate that the minimum investment size will be approximately  we do not anticipate being heavily invested in any one industry and generally we do not expect to invest in more than two different classes of debt of the same target company we intend to invest in debt and equitylinked debt of target companies with a minimum enterprise value of  million and whose debt and equitylinked debt is actively traded in the secondary loan market we expect our portfolio to be predominantly composed of fixedrate highyield and equitylinked corporate debt securities however we may also purchase senior secured corporate debt securities which may have variable interest rates we currently anticipate that the portion of our portfolio composed of variable rate corporate debt securities if any will not exceed  but we may increase that to  of our aggregate portfolio at the time of any purchase depending on market opportunities   we intend to offer our shareholders the ability to receive distributions as well as the potential capital appreciation resulting from the restructuring of the debt of our target companies to the extent we have distributable income available we anticipate declaring distributions monthly and paying them on a semimonthly basis we declared our first two distributions of  per share each an annualized rate of  based on our initial public offering price of  per share to shareholders of record as of july   payable on august   and august     between  and  corporate debt levels and the supply of leverage offered by banks and other investors steadily increased we believe a significant amount of this debt will be subject to a redemption event prior to  many of the companies that have outstanding issues of such debt have not or been unable to proactively refinance creating a “refinancing wall” that we believe will create a liquidity shortfall for many issuers the value of the debt securities of these companies as reflected in prices quoted in the secondary loan market may be at a significant discount to par and represent a premium yield to maturity reflective of these liquidity concerns creating the opportunity for us to identify and invest in the debt securities of select companies at attractive current market valuations we believe that our cooptivist tm approach can help our target companies achieve results that are beneficial to the longterm value of their businesses which will in turn result in capital gains through capital appreciation or the exchange of invested securities into a current security or cash at a premium to its acquisition price our principals collectively have experience in principal investing debt securities and general capital markets and we believe we are wellpositioned to capitalize on these opportunities   our investment activities are managed by our manager who is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  as amended or the advisers act our manager is

recognition   we record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts for loans and debt securities with contractual paymentinkind “pik” interest which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance we generally will not accrue pik interest for accounting purposes if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such pik interest is not collectible we do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities for accounting purposes if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest original

raising gross offering proceeds in excess of  million from persons who are not affiliated with us or our manager and commenced operations from july   to august   we issued  shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  million with the proceeds from our continuous offering we purchased a total of eight debt investments in with an aggregate face value of  million for  million in cash   revenues   our activities since inception have largely been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for our public offering of shares of our common stock we plan to generate revenue primarily from the cash interest we will collect on our debt investments and to a lesser extent from the early termination fees that many of our debt investments require the borrower to pay further we may generate revenue in the form of commitment origination structuring or diligence fees any such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned   expenses   we expect our primary annual operating expenses to be the payment of base management fees and incentive fees and the reimbursement of expenses under our investment advisory agreement and our administration

subsequent to meeting our minimum offering requirement we will sell our shares on a continuous basis at an initial offering price of  however to the extent that our net asset value per share increases we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that our shares are not sold at a price after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees that is below our net asset value per share in the event of a material decline in our nav per share which we consider to be a  decrease below our current net offering price and subject to certain conditions we will reduce our offering price accordingly a decline in our nav per share to an amount more than  below our current offering price net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees creates a rebuttable presumption that there has been a material change in the value of our assets such that a reduction in the offering price per share is warranted this presumption may only be rebutted if our board of directors in consultation with its management reasonably and in good faith determines that the decline in nav per share is the result of a temporary movement in the credit markets or the value of our assets rather than a more fundamental shift in the valuation of our portfolio in the event that i nav per share decreases to more than  below our current net offering price and ii our board of directors believes that such decrease in nav per share is the result of a nontemporary movement in the credit markets or the value of our assets the board of directors will undertake to establish a new net offering price that is not more than  above our nav per share if our board of directors determines that the decline in our nav per share is the result of a temporary movement in the credit markets or the value of our assets investors will purchase common stock at an offering price per share net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees which represents a premium to the nav per share of greater than  in connection with each semimonthly closing on the sale of our shares pursuant to this prospectus on a continuous basis our board of directors or a committee thereof is required to make the determination that we are not selling our shares at a price below our then current net asset value within  hours of the time that we price our shares   on july   we satisfied our minimum offering requirement of raising

debt securities we will invest the net proceeds from our continuous offering primarily in cash cash equivalents us government securities and highquality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment consistent with our business development company election and our election to be taxed as a ric   we do not expect to borrow funds during the following twelve months to make investments in the future however if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities or if our board of directors determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders we may decide to borrow funds to make investments we do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred shares        distributions   as of june   we had not made any distributions we intend to authorize and declare distributions monthly and pay distributions on a semimonthly basis to our shareholders   we commenced operations on july   and on july   we declared two semimonthly distributions of  per share each an annualized rate of  based on our initial public offering price of  per share to stockholders of record on july   payable on august   and august     any distributions to our shareholders will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution we expect to continue making distributions unless our results of operations our general financial condition general economic conditions or other factors prohibit us from doing so there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain distributions at any particular level    each year a statement on internal revenue service form div or such successor form identifying the source of the distribution ie paid from ordinary income paid from net capital gain on the sale of securities or a return of capital will be mailed to our shareholders our distributions may exceed our earnings especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from this offering as a result a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes the tax basis of shares must be reduced by the amount of any return of capital distributions which will result in an increase in the amount of any taxable gain or a reduction in any deductible loss on the sale of shares   distribution reinvestment plan   we have adopted an “optin” distribution reinvestment plan pursuant to which you may elect to have the full amount of your cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock if you wish to receive your distribution in cash no action will be required on your part to do so there will be no selling commissions dealer manager fees or other sales charges to you if you elect to participate in the distribution reinvestment plan we will pay the plan administrator’s fees under the plan your distribution amount will purchase shares at  of the price that the shares are offered pursuant to the effective registration statement of the public offering shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan will have the same voting rights as our shares of common stock offered pursuant to this prospectus   election as a ric   we intend to elect to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code commencing in the first taxable year in which we meet the minimum offering requirements as a ric we generally will not have to pay corporatelevel us federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our tax earnings and profits to qualify as a ric we must among other things meet certain sourceofincome and asset diversification requirements in addition in order to obtain ric tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders for each taxable year at least  of our “investment company taxable income” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess if any of realized net shortterm capital gain over
