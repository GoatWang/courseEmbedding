science foundation the national science foundation nsf is an independent federal agency created by congress in  to promote the progress of science to advance the national health prosperity and welfare to secure the national defense… with an annual budget of about  billion fy  we are the funding source for approximately  percent of all federally supported basic research conducted by america’s colleges and universities in many fields such as mathematics computer science and the social sciences nsf is the major source of federal backing we fulfill our mission chiefly by issuing limitedterm grants  currently about  new awards per year with an average duration of three years  to fund specific research proposals that have been judged the most promising by a rigorous and objective meritreview system most of these awards go to individuals or small groups of investigators others provide funding for research centers instruments and facilities that allow scientists engineers and students to work at the outermost frontiers of knowledge nsfs goalsdiscovery learning research infrastructure and stewardshipprovide an integrated strategy to advance the frontiers of knowledge cultivate a worldclass broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens build the nations research capability through investments in advanced instrumentation and facilities and support excellence in science and engineering research and education through a capable and responsive organization we like to say that nsf is where discoveries begin many of the discoveries and technological advances have been truly revolutionary in the past few decades nsffunded researchers have won more than  nobel prizes as well as other honors too numerous to list these pioneers have included the scientists or teams that discovered many of the fundamental particles of matter analyzed the cosmic microwaves left over from the earliest epoch of the universe developed carbon dating of ancient artifacts decoded the genetics of viruses and created an entirely new state of matter called a boseeinstein condensate nsf also funds equipment that is needed by scientists and engineers but is often too expensive for any one group or researcher to afford examples of such major research equipment include giant optical and radio telescopes antarctic research sites highend computer facilities and ultrahighspeed connections ships for ocean research sensitive detectors of very subtle physical phenomena and gravitational wave observatories another essential element in nsfs mission is support for science and engineering education from prek through graduate school and beyond the research we fund is thoroughly integrated with education to help ensure that there will always be plenty of skilled people available to work in new and emerging scientific engineering and technological fields and plenty of capable teachers to educate the next generation no single factor is more important to the intellectual and economic progress of society and to the enhanced wellbeing of its citizens than the continuous acquisition of new knowledge nsf is proud to be a
