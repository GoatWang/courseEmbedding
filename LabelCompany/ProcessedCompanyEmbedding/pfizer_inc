meningitis in subsaharan africa in  families of the children as well as the governments of kano and nigeria filed lawsuits regarding the treatment according to the news program democracy now researchers did not obtain signed consent forms and medical personnel said pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug the lawsuits also accuse pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing as well as allegedly underdosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of trovan while the specific facts of the case remain in dispute both nigerian medical personnel and at least one pfizer physician have stated that the trial was conducted without regulatory approval in  pfizer published a statement of defense letter the letter states that the drugs oral form was safer and easier to administer that trovan had been used safely in over  americans prior to the nigerian trial

young university byu said that a professor of chemistry dr daniel l simmons discovered an enzyme in the s that would later lead towards the development of celebrex byu was originally seeking  royalty on sales which would equate to  billion the court filings show that a research agreement was made with monsanto whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by pfizer to develop a better aspirin the enzyme that dr simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems which celebrex is used to reduce those issues a battle ensued lasting over six years because byu claimed that pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while pfizer claims it had met all obligations regarding the monsanto agreement this culminated in a  million

residents sued to stop the seizure the case went to the supreme court and with regard to pfizer the court cited a prior decision that said the record clearly demonstrates that the development plan was not intended to serve the interests of pfizer inc or any other private entity but rather to revitalize the local economy by creating temporary and permanent jobs generating a significant increase in tax revenue encouraging spinoff economic activities and maximizing public access to the waterfront” the supreme court allowed the eminent domain to proceed pfizer opened the facility in  but abandoned

potential public uses the sierra club and the edison wetlands association have come out in opposition to the cleanup plan arguing that the area is subject to flooding which could cause pollutants to leach the epa considers the plan the most reasonable from considerations of safety and costeffectiveness arguing that an alternative plan involving trucking contaminated soil off site could expose

celebrex is used to reduce those issues a battle ensued lasting over six years because byu claimed that pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while pfizer claims it had met all obligations

controversy including four settlements — one totaling  billion — over charges of illegal marketing it’s also involved in countless personal injury lawsuits it also ranked last among the top  drug makers for reputation according to a reputation institute  report history of pfizer after its launch in  pfizer grew during the civil war selling painkillers preservatives disinfectants and solutions like iodine morphine chloroform camphor and mercurial as the company expanded the headquarters moved to manhattan in  and a warehouse opened in chicago in  the company’s next major discovery was

medication became pfizer’s first billiondollar product pfizer created antibiotics antifungal medications blood pressure diabetes and depression drugs and was named the world’s most admired pharmaceutical company by fortune magazine in  blockbuster drugs lipitor became the largestselling pharmaceutical of any kind the s and early s were a time of blockbuster drugs for pfizer including a

pfizer in  lipitor quickly grew to be the largestselling pharmaceutical of any kind in history reaching  billion in revenue in  the company also had two other major successes at the time chantix a smoking cessation drug and bextra a painkiller in  pfizer acquired another giant company wyeth broadening its product offerings and expanding its workforce at the end of  however lipitor lost patent protection in order to combat decreased sales revenue from patent expiration of lipitor and other drugs the company cut back on around  primary care sales employees it stated the downsizing move would

growing number of scandals involving some of its most popular drugs pfizer has agreed to multiple settlements over charges of illegal marketing in  pfizer paid a  million fine based on claims that it defrauded the medicaid program and overcharged consumers for lipitor other settlements varied in size — the neurontin settlement in  cost  million and detrol in  cost  million in  the company paid

justice doj filed the criminal charges because of pfizer’s marketing for bextra although the fda only approved the drug for arthritis and menstrual cramps pfizer reportedly told sales representatives to tell doctors it could be used for unapproved indications like acute pain and surgical pain and that it could be taken in high doses however the drug came with serious heart and skin risks which caused pfizer to withdraw it in  and face a criminal investigation for misbranding the drug in  it paid  million to settle a lawsuit that claimed it misled investors about the clinical results of

worked on the clinical trials but did not agree to the method used he later wrote a letter to a federal judge claiming pfizer did not obtain proper approval for the drug trial and faked the paperwork he claimed the drug company bribed local nigerian officials and that  pfizer executives and fda officials knew about it while the fda began an investigation it suddenly stopped according to walterspiel walterspiel’s letter claims pfizer used bribes to continue the trovan study did not obtain consent from the parents of the children ignored potential drug reactions produced fake ethics documents in support of the test and gave them to the fda walterspiel first made the accusations in the early s but because they were part of a sealed file it went largely unnoticed he sent a copy to judge jeff kindler pauley in january  and the judge entered it into record in  pfizer paid out  each to four families who lost children during the trovan trials the payouts were a part of an outofcourt settlement reached in  the guardian reported the company set up a  million fund for those affected by trovan and agreed to sponsor health projects in kano nigeria drug warnings settlements

were already exposed to the risk the american public is not the only sector of society influenced by big pharma’s techniques doctors scientists and research organizations medical journals teaching

many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena including  who worked for a member of congress  who worked for a federal agency  who worked for a congressional committee two who worked for the white house one who worked in the court system using these connections to pursue industry goals big pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest marketing research and development rd and drug cost americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases thousands of dollars more per prescription big pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug cost facts while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the truth is that us law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from freemarket competition other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug the true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery with many unverifiable figures reported by big pharma donald light a professor and expert on the pharma business model said that while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing which is almost double what it spends on research big pharma sways opinions the large amount of cash big pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on directtoconsumer advertising the us is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on tv the other is new zealand in  big pharma spent  billion on directtoconsumer ads and fired off about  ads an hour according to nielsen big pharma also employs doctors researchers and institutions the industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal paid copywriters were used in advertising paxil above often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product big pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs including the antidepressant paxil the recalled weight loss drug fenphen the antiepilepsy drug neurontin the antidepressant zoloft and painkiller vioxx to name a few in addition even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on big pharma’s payroll these slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence yet richard smith former editor of the british medical journal says “all journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry” big pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications consider the numbers advertising instead of research for every  spent on “basic research” big pharma spends  on promotions and advertising distribution of free drug samples the us has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five officebased physicians sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors including covering meals travel seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations many medical journals including the esteemed journal of the american medical association jama actively vie for the attention of big pharma advertising dollars billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership how big pharma influences doctors and researchers part of big pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive brand name drugs fact in  big pharma spent  billion on physician advertising according to pew charitable trusts drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty one  study in jama internal medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than  they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug according to propublica’s dollars for docs investigation  companies paid  billion to doctors and hospitals from august  to december  drug and device company payments to doctors from select companies august  to december  company payments depuy johnson  johnson  million stryker corporation  million astrazeneca  million pfizer  million janssen pharmaceuticals  million glaxosmithkline  million boston scientific  million big pharma and researchers then there are medical researchers who are hardly immune to big pharma’s financial power because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers sponsors keep the data analyze it write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication drug companies also stagemanage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light medical schools and big pharma big pharma has also infiltrated medical schools teachers department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors this influences educational content money from big pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs the result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drugintensive style of medicine sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer more expensive drugs are always better than old ones in most states doctors must also take accredited education courses called continuing medical education cme the pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on cme annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool in addition academic centers are able to receive royalties from big pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds columbia university for example received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products columbia university received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesbig pharma fraud settlements in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud according to public citizen’s  report pharmaceutical industry settlements  through  fact in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud the most common charge involved drugpricing scams against state medicaid programs this meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while big pharma made billions unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements but these investigations take many years to complete by then drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion while the us department of justice fine is typically only a few million this makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies according to michael bobelian of forbes magazine manufacturer directory several of the biggest drug and medical device
