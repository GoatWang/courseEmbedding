a singletier architecture in which presentation applications and data were on one platform in  sap released r a mainframe system that provided realtime data processing across accounting manufacturing supply chain and human resources r used a twotier architecture where presentation was on one platform and applications and data were on another r helped power saps growth and the vendor expanded its customer base to about  companies in  sap released r which represented a switch from mainframe computing to the clientserver model and from a twotier to a threetier architecture in which presentation applications and data were housed separately r was a critical product for sap that launched the company onto the world stage in  sap launched mysap which marked a new strategy for the company of focusing on combining ecommerce software with the applications in r one year after rs release sap partnered with microsoft to port the new version to windows nt by  sap employed  people in  the

this the company established sap america in pennsylvania in  eventually moving to its permanent headquarters in newtown square pa at first the company staffed sap america with some of its german managers however it soon became clear that a staff more aligned with american culture would be more effective and the company began hiring staff from the united states sap americas profits quickly

were working in an enterprisewide system based on this software only to be told that it would no longer be necessary rather than abandoning the project they decided to leave ibm tech and start another company in june  they founded systemanalyse und programmentwicklung system analysis and program development company as a private partnership under the german civil code their first client was the german branch of imperial chemical industries in östringen where they developed mainframe programs for payroll and accounting instead of storing the data on punch cards mechanically as ibm did they
