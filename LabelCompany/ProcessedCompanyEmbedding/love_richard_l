most recent overall rating helpfulness see    displaying items  of  page  of   next cara putman indiana age  gender female  stars out of  engaging medical suspense june   cara putman indiana age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  in fatal trauma the reader is set up for a thrill filled ride from the first pages the action pulsates theres also a complicated romance and strong faith element what i liked most were the intense medical scenes coupled with the question of how the complex mystery would be resolved the characters were interesting and at varied stages in their personal lives and faith journeys it was a world i enjoyed entering was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate grandaddya age over  gender male  stars out of  do all things work for good june   grandaddya age over  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  dr richard mabry has written another excellent book that kept me turning the pages on past bedtime i had to keep reading to learn what happened next and to find out how things would end the suspense continued to mount as i kept rooting for the good guys and waiting for the bad guys to trip up the person behind all the bad stuff came as a total surprise i often have a fairly good clue halfway through a book and just keep reading to see how the hero and heroine are going to figure things out this book was not like that i appreciated the weaving of the good news into the book as several of the characters dealt with their beliefs and where they placed their faith its a wellwritten book that i highly recommend to those who enjoy a story full of suspense excitement surprises medical drama and romance was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate heartheart victorville ca age  gender female  stars out of  a gunman with nothing to lose faces a doctor who could lose everything june   heartheart victorville ca age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  i cant imagine anything more stressful for a er doctor than a simple day at work everything changes and it truly is never the same day twice every patient you get into the trauma department could be that patients final chance at life and it all rests in your hands but what if your typical day at the office was interrupted by an armed gunman who brought you a patient bleeding out his request if you dont save him you all will die one by one definitely not what you dreamed would happen when you arrived for work today but such is the premise behind richard l mabrys latest suspense novel fatal trauma i have absolutely loved every single novel richard l mabry has written because to truly appreciate any medical suspense novel you have to have a working knowledge of what it takes to be a doctor working in a hospital and the terminology and procedures have to line up correctly to be believable and thankfully due to being a retired physician this comes across beautifully in all his novels dr mark baker is attempting to keep a handle on things when the armed man holds a gun to er nurse kelly atkinsons head unless they can save the unconscious man in the wheelchair more people will die beginning with kelly just how does someone save a man who clearly appears to be dead while waiting for the possibility of help to arrive how do you distract an armed gunman who seems to be drug induced will there be a possible future for mark and kelly if they can find a way out of what has walked into their er tonight youll have to pick this one up to find out i received fatal trauma by richard l mabry md compliments of abingdon press and litfuse publicity for my honest review i did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review outside the complimentary copy of the novel and the opinions contained here are strictly my own this novel is definitely adrenaline filled from the first chapter readers are thrust into a situation one hopes never happens in real life and as the body count begins to rise you wonder how it will all turn out my favorite part about this novel is the authentic medical descriptions that move the story along you can tell its genuine because of the authors background in the medical field and for me this is why i love any of richard l mabrys novels he takes you someplace you could have never imagined happening to people in the medical field but there is always that possibility for me this one rocks the suspense at a full  out of  stars readers even get a sneak peek at the next novel miracle drug coming out soon a readers discussion guide is also included was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate maureent syracuse ny gender female  stars out of  youll never see it coming june   maureent syracuse ny gender female quality  value  meets expectations  fatal trauma had my heart in my throat from the first page forward and made me keep turning the page and i was not disappointed we have a you er doctor and nurse busy working and taking care of patients when a gunman arrives with a man in a wheelchair having been shot the man pushing the chair has a gun to the head of the nurse and threatens everyone on the room oh my this is just a taste of what you are about to experience as you enter the world and mind of dr mabry the twists and violence didnt make sense to me but when drugs are involved nothing makes is too much and of course there is a lot of money involved this is not just one sweet romantic book no but it does have some romance you just wont be sure who is involved for a while i never saw a lot of what happened coming and some that i thought were the criminals turned out to be one of the good guys and others oh my they sure fooled me who can be trusted just one and that is god and yes there is a christian focus in this book and made my enjoyment of this book even greater if you love suspense as i do this is going to be a favorite book for you a real pageturner and dont let your guard down you will be waiting for the other shoe to drop i received this book through litfuse publicity blog tours and was not required to give a positive review was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate doc hilton horseshoe bend ar age  gender male  stars out of  another pageturner from dr richard l mabry md june   doc hilton horseshoe bend ar age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  dr mark baker was in the wrong place at the wrong time he was at work in the busy emergency room at busy memorial hospital thats where it all started and thats where his life abruptly changed he just didnt know it yet writing in his traditional read edge of the seat pulsepounding suspense style dr richard mabry brings his technical skills as a retired physician to yet another pageturner as the book deals with life and death on various levels dr mabry also brings his faith demonstrating once again that faith and life do not have to live in separate compartments author richard mabry tells the tale of life and death winning and losing and most of all    the tale of love love for one another and gods love for all humanity he doesnt preach he doesnt teach he is a master at show and tell a game that we all enjoyed when we were growing up has become a vehicle for entertaining readers and impacting their lives and they dont even know it
