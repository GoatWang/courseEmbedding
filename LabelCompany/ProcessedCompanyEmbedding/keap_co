athletic shorts reimagined eugene or product design  pledged of  goal  backers coral and grey shorts are renderings colors may differ slightlythanks everyone for your support we are well on our way to a successful campaign we are happy to announce that we have a new  stretch goal if our project gets over  worth of funding we will be able to release two new colors of shorts once the project has ended you will be able to choose from all three colors no matter when you pledgednew colors crisp coral with diamond white stitching  summit grey with midnight black stitchingthanks again to everyone who has supported us keapitup keap athletics was born out of necessity our team was tired of our favorite companies designing our shorts with pockets that did not do the job every pair of shorts we wore had pockets that were cut with a vertical opening the problem you sit down and all your stuff falls to the floor into the couch or down the crack of your car seat we set out to create a remarkably simple solution we experimented with zippers velcro and double layered pockets but none had the ease of access we were looking for our solution was simple change the angle of the pocket this simple change yields profoundly better results  the heart and soul of the keap athletic short is its custom designed horizontally cut pocket measuring  deep our pockets do a remarkable job of keeping your belongs safe no other athletic shorts do a better job of combining security with functionalitythe keap athletic short is the ultimate modern short for the modern athlete these shorts are a phenomenally lightweight  polyester fabric that is both comfortable and durable these shorts have a  inseam cut that is perfectly tailored for a modern look and feelfeatures a  waistband with an extra wide interior drawstring for comfort and have reinforced stitching at the pocket stress pointsshorts are exclusively available on kickstarter in midnight black with diamond white stitching this is the problemeveryone loves athletic shorts they are comfortable stylish and functional but we also love our phones unfortunately our shorts do not seem to care about our phones quite as much as we do athletic shorts currently on the market do a miserable job of keeping your stuff securely in your pockets the reason for this is actually quite simple the vertically cut pockets open in the exact spot your stuff naturally sitswe set out to create a solution to this problem and are extremely proud of what weve designed for you  this is our solutionafter identifying the root of the problem we knew the first step was simple eliminate the vertical opening from the pocket we then began experimenting with different styles of pockets that opened horizontallywe eventually ended with a horizontal pocket that sits just under your hip has a curved design and features an industry leading depth of  inchesas you can see in the gif below your phone is now remarkably secure keap shorts are great everywhere but they are really great at the gym whether youre laying down on the bench press running on the treadmill or in cycling class the keap shorts will keep your phone in your pocket instead of on the ground you no longer need to keep your phone keys and wallet on the dirty floor under your sweatshirt and pray that nobody starts snooping around your stuff now you can keep your stuff right by your side safe and secure and of course they are scientifically proven to help you get buckets  born in nikes backyard our team grew up wearing all things nike collectively we own over  pairs of their athletic shorts now as adults we still wanted to wear our nike shorts but couldnt trust our stuff to stay in our pockets unable to find a solution we bought a sewing machine and got to work our goal was simple create a better pocket we started experimenting with zippers on our shorts but it was too annoying to constantly zip and unzip when pulling out our phone x times per day we moved to velcro but decided to leave that for grandpas shoesnext was double layering the pockets unfortunately this ended up being even more inconvenient than the zipper and barely more secure than our other shortsseveral prototypes later we solved it and the answer is so simple a horizontally cut  deep pocket provides the perfect combination of convenience and security  this is our team they are awesome

falling out of my nike drifit shorts i said to myself there has to be a better option out there after tirelessly searching stores for shorts that would keep my stuff in i eventually gave up looking and decided to make my own i bought a sewing machine and began teaching myself to sew countless prototypes later i had something that actually resembled a real pair of shorts and a functional pocket i continued to refine the shorts and eventually began the process of manufacturing them i have come a long way from where i started and am extremely proud of the product we have today jordanmy name is
