of additional information proxy voting considerations view proxy filings view all sec filings your account information here are the rules we set to guide our investing by purchasing more shares of the index companies on a steady basis and selling rarely we feel our method is similar to dollarcost averaging into what we have believe are the best companies in a diverse group of industrieswe use invest to invest more in the companies when they are depressed we use the dividends paid by each company to make additional contributions into that company this approach takes advantage of market volatility when some of our stocks are down we accumulate more cheaply and those that are up in price provide financial and emotional support if everything is up we buy fewer shares if everything is down were buying more cheaply the stocks in our portfolio represent a wide range of industries and have the advantage of size and market leadership this allows us to spread investment risk over both time and component allocation also this posture allows us to limit turnover which would burden shareholders with unnecessary and unwanted capital gains distributions and taxes we constantly review the companies in the index and fund if a company were to no longer fulfill its role in our portfolio we would replace it we are happy to say that after careful scrutiny we believe that both our method of investing and our stock selections are on course to produce the results we desire many of you have been taking advantage of the automatic investing option to increase your holdings as well as the increased limits on retirement account contributions these are important parts of the steady inflow of new cash that fuels asset growth thanks to our disciplined shareholders weve never had to sell stock to meet redemption requests a problem that plagued some more conventional funds during the recent bear market such shareholder conduct has allowed us to take advantage of market declines to buy more shares we want to thank you for your comments and questions as managers we will continue to be accessible and responsive and we encourage you to join us in a regular program of investing in the
