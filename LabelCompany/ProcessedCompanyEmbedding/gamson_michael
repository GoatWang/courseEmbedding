career  business insider strategy bi intelligence events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × a top linkedin exec says a comment from one of his employees taught him a hiring lesson he never forgot richard feloni apr    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print mike gamson linkedins senior vice president of global solutions linkedin about five years ago mike gamson and the rest of the linkedin leadership team were wrapping up a successful corporate event when one of his employees approached him and asked why were all of the presenters on the main stage men i said two bad things gamson told business insider he told her he didnt notice and then he said it was just because those were all the people who were running linkedins departments and she goes thats my point he said read more the ceo of casper shares the biggest lesson hes learned from growing his mattress company to  million in  years as linkedins senior vice president of global solutions gamson oversees about half of the professional social networks roughly  employees he was also responsible for overseeing the launch of many of linkedins  offices throughout the world gamson who has been at the company for nearly  years said he considered the awkward conversation after that event the catalyst for one of the best lessons of his career he tended to hire executives who looked thought and acted like him silicon valley has a long history of being white and male — and more recently of tech leaders trying too hard to compensate for example john zimmer the cofounder and president of lyft recently proclaimed his ridesharing company was the woke alternative to what he deemed was its less progressive competitor uber that was greeted with eye rolls gamson admits that he and the fellow male leaders on his team started their new initiative basically by congratulating one another on their social awareness the first year of serious intent was pretty much a total failure in terms of changing things — just a group of guys just sitting around saying arent we enlightened we care about this were going to try to do something he said that didnt work read more the arbys ceo asked  us employees the same question before his hugely successful brand turnaround gamson eventually realized it would be smarter to partner with top female employees rather than woke guys so he did that launched the win womens initiative at linkedin and developed a threetiered approach rethink talent acquisition focus on developing talented women already at the company and implement unconsciousbias training linkedins new york office sarah jacobs the main lesson is this gamson wrote in a blog post if you are a male leader at a fastgrowing company and dont deliberately hire for a diverse workforce from the beginning eventually most of your hires and leaders are going to be much like you in fact probably too much like you because the default position of hiring is to tap your friends and friends of friends who are likely to look think act and speak like you and who often come from similar backgrounds he told us that while the issue of fewer women pursuing engineering careers is a complex one connected to the lack of female representation in tech roles at big silicon valley companies he realized that the sections he oversaw — essentially linkedins nontech departments — did not have such a talentpool problem linkedin like other major tech players is still largely male and white but it has been moving the needle on diversity according to its  diversity report the company is  male and  female tech is  male but nontech is  male and  female linkedins leadership is  male and  female read more the fact that i couldnt answer a career coachs simple questions showed me id been making a crucial mistake at work since  when win began overall female representation is up  and representation in senior sales leadership is up  for context facebook is  male and  female nontech roles are  male and  female and leadership is  male and  female google is  male and  female nontech roles are  male and  female and leadership is  male and  female gamson said he has learned over the past few years that its partly a matter of spending more time looking at qualified candidates rather than hiring the first person who seems to fit the first thing was just im ok with instead of taking eight weeks it takes  weeks to find the right person — great no problem he said that was a huge differencemaker see also a top
