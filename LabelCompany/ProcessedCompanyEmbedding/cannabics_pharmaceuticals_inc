is personalized medicine pm we have developed an automated highthroughput method for the screening of different types of cancer cells or biopsies treated with a multitude of cannabis extracts these natural extracts could also be tested in conjunction with already approved and common synthetic drugs for patients that undergo chemotherapy for the most personally tailored therapy this multilayer method is producing a largescale database that will capture the knowledge gained as to the unique effects of different combinations of cannabinoid compounds on diverse malignancies coextensive with the development of the automated highthroughput system we are also developing proprietary and novel compounds targeting diverse and specific types of tumors on january   the company executed an

cachexia syndrome cacs endpoints examined are weight gain appetite quality of life and a marker for anticancer activity quality of life in patients with cacs is directly related to loss of appetite and loss of weight this study examines the influence of cannabics pharmaceuticals sr capsules on both of these common effects of cancer and cancer treatment secondary outcome measures are improvement in appetite reduction in tnfalpha level safety assessment for early psychiatric sideeffects quality of life and evaluation of muscle strength while this study is taking place in israel it is fully registered with the us nih under cannabics capsules as treatment to improve cancer related cacs in advanced cancer patients identifier nct and may be found at httpsclinicaltrialsgovctshownct on june   the company filed a pct application with the us patent  trademark office uspto entitled a system and method for high throughput screening of cancer cells cannabics pharmaceuticals has developed a proprietary high throughput screening process which is designed to generate megadata of specific cannabinoids and cannabinoid formulations with antitumor properties in this proprietary process biopsies and live cancer cells lines are treated in vitro with innumerous combinations of cannabinoids and the resulting antitumor effects are screened categorized and actually visually displayed on december   the company announced the results from its cancer hts research which indicate that specific ratios of cannabinoids led to apoptosis in mdamb breast cancer cell viability on january   the company announced development of its mg thc capsule intended for na�ve patients who have not tried cannabis in the past the cannabics mg thc capsule is currently being evaluated by the company in its clinical study of palliative treatment which is conducted by the oncology department at the prestigious rambam medical center in northern israel and under strict regulations of the ministry of health by whom cannabics pharmaceuticals has been licensed since  on july th  the company executed a testing  diagnostics services agreement with simfo gmbh a renown german research laboratory which is collaborative in nature simfo gmbh will obtain the ctc count as well as drug sensitivity tests from treaded patients according to the specific cannabinoids which the company shall request plan of operation cannabics pharmaceuticals inc is dedicated to the development of cannabinoid medicine and screening for cancer patients the companys rd is focused on the three aspects of cancer treatment  diagnostics and antitumor medicine and palliative medicine cannabics vision is to create personalized natural medicine tailored to specific types of cancers and genetics of patients utilizing novel biotechnological tools the companys intellectual property surpasses proprietary capsulated formulations designated for specific cancer related indications diagnostic procedures and data the parent company cannabics inc was founded by a group of israeli researchers from the fields of cancer research pharmacology and molecular biology in  the companys research is located in israel which has allowed for the use of medical cannabis since the s and has a favorable regulatory attitude towards the conducting of cannabis based clinical studies in israeli hospitals in marked contrast to the legal situation in the united states where clinical research on medical cannabis is still illegal this structure is an extraordinary corporate advantage and markedly separates the company from similarly minded companies the number of people licensed to receive medical cannabis treatment in israel numbers around   in comparison to over  in the united states therefore while the israeli market potential is regarded as limited the ability to perform standardized clinical studies and use the israeli regulation to prove the effectiveness of the companys products is proving to be highly advantageous most importantly while the us fda has barely approved even basic private research relating to cannabis the regulatory environment is quite different in israel within the israeli ministry of health there is a standalone agency the israeli medical cannabis agency imca which on october   granted cannabics pharmaceuticals an exclusive government license to launch our scientific program through the large body of research that has been conducted by its scientists and affiliated partners the company has been able to gain indepth knowledge of the various therapeutic effects of cannabinoids and identify patterns of cannabinoid ratios that bear the potential of treating various types of cancers the company is currently in the midst of several collaborative programs with several leading academic research and medical centers in israel in order to further establish the beneficial therapeutic effects of its proprietary compounds and to refine its development of personalized anticancer medicine the companys three main areas of scientific research are comprised within cancer diagnostics utilizing novel biological screening technologies we monitor the antitumor effects of arrays of botanical extracts on cell lines and biopsies the data collected propels the development of proprietary and novel compounds targeted to diverse types of tumors this technology enables us to perform lab tests that offer doctors and their patients a profile of personalized treatment with cannabinoids we believe that our personalized approach minimizes harmful side effects with more successful outcomes and lower costs than the traditional trialanderror approach to treatment we are presently conducting diagnostic validation studies in collaboration with academic institutes and lab facilities and expect to have preliminary results available by march  anticancer treatments we are developing botanical cannabinoid formulations based on our proprietary diagnostic procedures designated for the treatment of cancer and its sideeffects we are currently working in collaboration with simfo gmbh a renown german research laboratory on ctc tests we are also conducting preclinical research on the efficacy of our cannabinoidbased formulations in the treatment of cancer and expect to have preliminary results available by march  if our diagnostic data crosslinked with clinical outcomes demonstrates that our formulations have therapeutic and commercial potential we intend to submit an investigational new drug application with the us food and drug administration to commence clinical trials palliative therapies we have developed our nonpharmaceutical capsules as a treatment to improve cancer related cachexiaanorexia syndrome cacs in advanced cancer patients the main purpose in the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and cacs is to prolong life and to improve quality of life qol as far as possible we believe that qol in patients with cacs is inversely related to reduced appetite and weightloss we are currently engaged in a clinical study in israel to determine the efficacy of our proprietary capsules as a treatment to improve appetite and stem weightloss associated with cacs in advanced cancer patients we expect that preliminary results of our study will be available in july  cannabics mg capsules for palliative care while the medicinal effects of certain cannabinoids are well known to physicians it is common knowledge that smoking is hazardous to health many physicians are perfectly aware of the palliative properties of cannabis ie antiemetic and analgesic however they refrain from recommending or prescribing it to patients knowing that smoking the raw flowers is still the most common and available administration route hence the availability of an oral standardized reliable and clinically tested administration route of medical cannabis  no different from the administration route of most medications consumed by patients today  would dramatically improve the availability of medical cannabis therapy to patients in need standardization and reproducibility the efficacy of our cannabics mg capsules is currently being evaluated in a study that is taking place in the rambam medical center in haifa israel and it is fully registered with the us nih under cannabics capsules as treatment to improve cancer related cacs in advanced cancer patients identifier nct and may be found at httpsclinicaltrialsgovctshownct diagnostics and personalized medicine cannabinoids include phytocannabinoids endogenous endocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids more than  phytocannabinoids have been identified within the cannabis plant cannabinoids elicit their pharmacological activities through cannabinoid receptor type  cb and type  cb two gprotein coupled receptors gpcr in the endocannabinoid signaling pathway cancer is a disease in which alterations in the cannabinoid pathway have been demonstrated since this disease is found to be multifactorial variations in expression of cannabinoid receptors could be harnessed to elicit a therapeutic effect therefore a defined botanical extract may better achieve this therapeutic goal than a single synthetic compound as the multiple components elicit a synergistic effect cannabinoids are not yet approved for the treatment of cancer although their antitumor effects have been known for over  years scientific evidence exists which strongly suggest that cannabinoids may have anticancer activity the exact mechanism by which this antitumor effect occurs may involve suppression of proliferative cell signaling pathways inhibition of angiogenesis and cell migration and induction of apoptosis andor induction of autophagy personalized medicine pm is a novel approach that proposes the customization of therapy being tailored to the individual patient there are over  different known cancers and the genetic divergence among humans makes it nearly impossible to find one remedy for a group of people in view of the above cannabics utilizes highthroughput technologies to screen antitumor effects mainly apoptosis and proliferation on cell lines and biopsies treated with matrix of plant extracts differentiated in their ratios of active compounds this diagnostic procedure can now offer doctors data on the potential antitumor activity of available cannabis products the data unraveled in this procedure is also recruited in the creation of proprietary antitumor compounds anti tumor medicine to date cannabics has gained valuable data on the antiproliferative properties of cannabinoids on specific types of cancers and is currently engaging in preclinical studies which will translate into clinical studies that will evaluate proprietary cannabinoid compounds as anticancer treatments all cannabics formulations are predesigned to fit the currently existing medical cannabis regulations in israel europe and certain us states which are licensed as a medical marijuana infused products manufacturer ie � crs the ingredients used in the proprietary formulations are all certified food grade ingredients recognized by the fda as gras  generally regarded as safe and the formulation are free of any artificial additives or chemical substances thus cannabics medicines are fully compliant with the current cannabis infused edible product regulatory definition which is in fact very similar to a regular food supplement regulatory definition the companys business model is solely based on technology development and ip outlicensing to licensed and certified producers the companys technologies are licensed to a strategic partner in compliance with each countrys andor us states statutory regulations and exclusively to licensed and authorized medical cannabis local licensees that have adequate production and marketing capabilities cannabics pharmaceuticals inc itself does not manufacture distribute dispense or possess any controlled substances including cannabis
