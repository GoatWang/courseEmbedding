successfully emailed the post × we talked to one of the most senior women on wall street about big deals investment mistakes and career advice rachael levy apr    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print carlyles sandra horbachcarlyleprivate equity has come a long way what is now a  trillion industry managing money on behalf of public pensions and the like started as a hodgepodge of socalled leveraged buyout firms popularized in the s some historians would quibble and say the industrys origins date back much further though not in any stance like today business insider recently sat down with sandra horbach the cohead of us buyouts at the  billion carlyle group to get a sense of how the industry has changed described as a trailblazer horbach is one of carlyles most senior women she also represents a rarity in the industry only  of senior positions in buyouts are held by women according to the data tracker preqin the buyout business typically involves buying up companies often with borrowed money and changing the companies to increase their value at a future point of sale those changes could include swapping out management and cutting business units or staff horbach previously focused on consumer and retail investing her current group oversees those industries as well as tech media and telecom aerospace and defense industrial and transportation and healthcare private equity is often grouped with hedge funds as they use alternative investment strategies while private equity invests directly in private companies often changing them from within hedge funds typically invest in companies through public markets making investments in companies stocks and bonds multiple surveys have found that institutional investors and family offices plan to hand more money to privateequity investors while pulling money from hedge funds we met at carlyles new york office which features a sweeping view of manhattan what follows is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation rachael levy how has the buyout game changed sarah horbach i think the question is how hasnt it changed when i started in the business back in  there were two firms with  billion in capital kkr and forstmann little  co thirty years later there are thousands of firms with billions in capital so weve grown significantly as an industry in a very short period of time when i started in the business there were a handful of small firms five  individuals basically looking for great opportunities to invest very little amounts of equity a lot of leverage and a lot of returns were created through financial engineering the returns that you could realize back then were significant you could realize five times  times your money because you were putting smaller amounts of equity into the entire capital structure today most deals because of the competition and the valuations being paid you’re putting  to  in equity into most deals assets in private equity have steadily grownpreqinthe check size has obviously grown and the number of deals taking place have grown but clearly the returns have come down theyre still more attractive than the returns youre seeing in any other asset category but certainly theyve come down from the early days when there was very little competition and an abundance of deals to do with a lot of leverage levy with interest rates going up how does that affect the privateequity industry horbach interest rates are still at very low levels theres an abundance of capital and there are still very attractive low rates to be able to finance deals the tougher situation is the abundance of capital chasing deals and the high valuations being paid in todays marketplace today were seeing the average transaction north of  times ebitda and those are only continuing to increase levy how do you make sure youre not overpaying horbach were looking for opportunities where we can have a differentiated approach to value creation youre only going to see carlyle invest in assets where we have sector expertise so were picking the right spots and where we see we have a valuecreation plan that could be a costsavings opportunity bringing new management to the opportunity that could improve the way the business is run we have to have a strategy as to how we will create value over the course of our investment if we dont have that youre unlikely to see us move forward on an investment opportunity levy private equity seems to be healthier than hedge funds in a lot of ways in terms of fundraising and performance preqinhorbach that is because of performance private equity as an industry outperformed every other index hedge funds public markets etc and if you look at the topperforming pe firms within that the delta is even greater so limited partners investors are voting with their dollars and allocating more capital to pe for public pensions private equity has outperformed hedge fundspreqinlevy in the hedge fund industry there is a lot of talk about closures fee reductions do you see a lot of fund launches or is it more that the bigger funds are continuing to grow horbach there are always a lot of funds coming to the market the larger lps investors the pensions and sovereign wealth funds are really narrowing their focus and putting more dollars to work with their largest and highestperforming gps fund managers there is a narrowing going on levy do you have a theory on why pe performance has generally been better than hedge fund performance horbach i believe its because we’re active managers and longterm investors our average investment horizon is fiveplus years before we make an investment we have a valuecreation strategy that upon close we begin to execute upon were not passive investors were not in and out of companies so we have the opportunity hold on to businesses even when the markets fluctuate and be able to look at the longterm value creation i think that has proven over time to be a very effective way to invest levy you have a lot of agency too horbach were on the board were helping with strategy were selecting the management team were making changes when we need to were very active managers compared to more passive on the hedge fund side were looking to build businesses and make them better than they were when we invested in them i always say we want our companies even after weve sold them to do really well — it shows weve added tremendous amount of value during our ownership at the end of the day its about creating value levy have there ever been investment mistakes that youve learned from horbach you cant be in our business for as long as ive been and not make mistakes you learn a lot from your mistakes and you hope not to repeat them in the future levy could you give an example horbach we invested in a company called oriental trading which was a very successful business that had grown for  years consecutively it was a catalog and direct marketer of party supplies celebratory products and servicing schools teachers and families we were very excited about the investment and we partnered with a former owner of the company to continue to grow and build the business a view of oriental tradings websitescreenshotthe investment was performing very well for the first couple of years the company performed really well out of the box but two years into the investment we hit the great recession and simultaneously the us postal office increased postage rates for catalogs by  so we had a massive increase in costs to the business at a time where we were entering a very negative economic environment so we were unsuccessful in returning capital to our investors we went through a restructuring today warren buffett owns the company its still a nice business but it couldnt support the debt load we had put in place at the time of the acquisition given both events were happening simultaneously levy those two factors seem a bit unpredictable one the crisis two the post office flickrnoize photographyhorbach youre right they were incredibly unpredictable but thats the lesson of the investment you cant assume that a company just because its been very successful for  years that it still cant be subject to tremendous shocks to the system in those cases you try to maintain the flexibility to weather through those storms but in some cases in our business thats not possible but it does humble you levy thats the only way you learn though right through trial and error horbach fortunately we have more positive stories to talk about than those kinds of stories levy if you could talk to your yearold self – i dont know if you were working in pe yet horbach no i wasnt i was in business school when i was  levy so your businessschool self think back what career advice would you give to that person horbach i would advise myself to follow my passion and pursue areas i really loved as opposed to what i thought i should do or where i thought i was going to make a lot of money i see a lot of young people going into private equity and i dont see the passion they think its the right thing to do because they look ahead and see people who have been successful but those of us who started in the industry had no idea it was going to turn into the industry its turned into harvard business schoolfacebookwhen i joined forstmann little in  right out of business school it wasnt even an industry we didnt call it private equity — it was leveraged buyouts it was all about the love of finding great companies to work with and invest and help build it wasnt about creating this mega industry that has since been created it starts with the passion and its a lot of hard work dedicating yourself to being the best you can be and having a thick skin and not taking things personally especially when youre young you know youre going in youre the junior person and you have to prove yourself and you have to make yourself indispensable you have to have a positive attitude and say to yourself how can i make my boss life better what can i do to proactively and preemptively create value here in my organization i think if you do all those things more opportunities will be presented and youll continue to grow and progress within the organization levy whats the best career advice youve ever received horbach i think the best advice i ever received was to really focus on relationships and to care about people that you work with and to never forget the human aspect of a deal because at the end of the day thats what really is going to drive success its the people who are running our companies that are really going to be the determinant of whether we have a successful outcome levy do you remember who gave you that advice horbach my father he was a realestate developer levy would you have advice specifically for women if it would be different horbach it wouldnt be different in terms of follow your passion work hard all that i talked about but i think women dont always put themselves in positions where they can be successful because they dont feel as though they are necessarily as qualified theres a statistic that shows a man will apply or job if hes  qualified for the job whereas women wont apply until shes  qualified so i always tell women raise your hand volunteer for tough assignments dont wait until youre  prepared to do anything jump into things and swim take chances women are often more riskaverse with their careers so i encourage women to take chances and volunteer for tough assignments likely theyll do a great job and theyll be recognized and rewarded and hopefully promoted as a result of that levy more generally for the pe industry are there any things the industry could do to attract more women spencer plattgetty imageshorbach weve made progress but we still have a long way to go i should speak about carlyle diversity has to start at the top of the organization and it does at carlyle we have programs in place to recruit women and diverse talent across the board we have an initiative where  of our new hires in the us are required to be diverse candidates a lot of those are women weve achieved levels that i think are unprecedented in any other pe firm for principals and managing directors  are women id like to see it be  and maybe it someday will be but its a lot better than the industry for sure weve come a long way in the past  years its a commitment from the top its outreach its recruiting we do a lot of initial spadework before we start recruiting women we go to business schools and to investment banks and talk about what the career is like at a place like carlyle and how you can be successful as a woman here and as a result weve had tremendous success in recruiting women last year in our incoming analyst class  were diverse and i want to say about  of that were women we had a  acceptance rate theyre seeing role models for women who are successful in the firm so that helps attract — theyre seeing the commitment we have to providing that i think all of those things make a difference in our ability to recruit i hear a lot of other firms say we want to find the women but we cant find them but we find them and theyre out there and theyre very talented now watch these are the watches worn by some of the most powerful men in finance more private equity facebook
