morningstar ownership zone™ provides detail about a portfolios equity investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles a portfolios ownership zone™ is derived by plotting each stock in the funds portfolio within the proprietary morningstar style box™ the shaded area represents the center  of the funds assets and it provides an intuitive visual representation of the area of the market in which the fund invests a centroid plot in the middle of the ownership zone represents the weighted average of all the funds holdings a fund that is concentrated will have a small ownership zone relative to the area of the style box and broadly diversified fund will have an ownership zone that stretches across many sizes and style over a period of time the shape and location of a funds ownership zone may vary the model for the fixedincome style box is based on the two pillars of fixedincome performance interestrate sensitivity and credit quality the three interest sensitivity groups are limited moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high medium and low these groupings display a portfolios effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the funds risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio the sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning

determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high below average this funds expenses are rated as below average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of

investments are subject to risk including the possible loss of principal pioneer multiasset income mai fund has the ability to invest in a wide variety of securities and asset classes high yield bonds possess greater price volatility illiquidity and possibility of default investments in fixed income securities involve interest rate credit inflation and reinvestment risks as interest rates rise the value of fixed income securities falls prepayment risk is the chance that an issuer may exercise its right to prepay its security if falling interest rates prompt the issuer to do so forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates the fund would experience a decline in income and lose the opportunity for additional price appreciation the fund may invest in mortgagebacked securities which during times of fluctuating interest rates may increase or decrease more than other fixedincome securities mortgagebacked securities are also subject to prepayments the fund may invest in subordinated securities which may be disproportionately adversely affected by a default or even a perceived decline in creditworthiness of the issuer international investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations social economic and political uncertainties which could increase volatility these risks are magnified in emerging markets the fund may invest in inflationlinked securities as inflationary expectations increase inflationlinked securities may become more attractive because they protect future interest payments against inflation conversely as inflationary concerns decrease inflationlinked securities will become less attractive and less valuable the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds the return of principal and the payment of interest on eventlinked bonds are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a predefined trigger event such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude the fund may invest in floating rate loans the value of collateral if any securing a floating rate loan can decline or may be insufficient to meet the issuers obligations or may be difficult to liquidate the fund may invest in underlying funds including etfs in addition to the funds operating expenses you will indirectly bear the operating expenses of investments in any underlying funds investments in equity securities are subject to price fluctuation smalland midcap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than largecap stocks the fund may invest in master limited partnerships which are subject to increased risks of liquidity price valuation control voting rights and taxation in addition the structure affords fewer protections to investors in the partnership than direct investors in a corporation the fund may invest in zero coupon bonds and payment in kind securities which may be more speculative and fluctuate more in value than other fixed income securities the accrual of income from these securities are payable as taxable annual dividends to shareholders the fund and some of the underlying funds may use derivatives such as options and futures which can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on fund performance the fund may invest in credit default swaps which may in some cases be illiquid and they increase credit risk since the fund has exposure to both the issuer of the referenced obligation and the counterparty to the credit default swap the fund and some of the underlying funds employ leverage which increases the volatility of investment returns and subjects the fund to magnified losses if an underlying funds investments decline in value these risks may increase share price volatility there is no assurance that these and other strategies used by the fund or underlying funds will be successful please see the prospectus for a more complete discussion of the funds risks before investing consider the products investment objectives risks charges

morningstar ownership zone™ provides detail about a portfolios equity investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles a portfolios ownership zone™ is derived by plotting each stock in the funds portfolio within the proprietary morningstar style box™ the shaded area represents the center  of the funds assets and it provides an intuitive visual representation of the area of the market in which the fund invests a centroid plot in the middle of the ownership zone represents the weighted average of all the funds holdings a fund that is concentrated will have a small ownership zone relative to the area of the style box and broadly diversified fund will have an ownership zone that stretches across many sizes and style over a period of time the shape and location of a funds ownership zone may vary the model for the fixedincome style box is based on the two pillars of fixedincome performance interestrate sensitivity and credit quality the three interest sensitivity groups are limited moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high medium and low these groupings display a portfolios effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the funds risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio the sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning
