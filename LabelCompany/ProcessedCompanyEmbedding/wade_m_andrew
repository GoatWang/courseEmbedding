in york pa  may  my symptoms were confusing and dr andrews thought my hand trouble was coming from something elsei looked at the medicine i had been taking for my breast cancer and suspected that so i stopped taking it and the symptoms lessoned but did not go away so we scheduled a nerve study and found severe carpal tunnel syndrome the very morning after my surgery i knew i felt a great difference in my symptoms i highly recommend the ctrelease surgery wont wait so long if there is a next timemount wolf pa  may  he had a horrible bedside manner he seemed annoyed with me because my daughter is

opposing position should be addedannette doelle in york pa  mar  i just left dr andrews appointment and it was not pleasant at all  he entered the room and did not introduce himself smile or ask me why i was there  he then proceeded to examine my hand  wrist while i was already having severe pain i understand pain is to expected but his lack of concern for my pain and comfort level was absent  he was offended i did not sign the consent to treat form because i had a question about itmore commentshave you seen dr wade andrews mdleave a revieware you dr andrewsmake it easy for patients to
