statements  expressed in us dollars  unaudited – prepared by management   september             nature and continuance of operations     dynamic gold corp the “company” was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on  january  and is in the exploration stage these interim consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the company is an exploration stage enterprise as defined in accounting standards codification the “codification” or “asc”  “ development stage entities ” the company is devoting all of its present efforts in establishing a new business and its planned principle operations have not commenced and accordingly no revenue has been derived during the organization period the company is in the business of acquiring and exploring mineral properties the recoverability of the amounts expended by the company on acquiring and exploring mineral properties is dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable reserves the ability of the company to complete the acquisition andor development of the properties and upon future profitable production the company’s interim consolidated financial statements as at  september  and for the three month period then ended have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business the company has a loss of  for the three month period ended  september   september  –  cumulative – and has a working capital deficit of  at  september   june  –  management cannot provide assurance that the company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt andor equity capital management believes that the company’s capital resources should be adequate to continue operating and maintaining its business strategy during the fiscal year ending  june  however if the company is unable to raise additional capital in the near future due to the company’s liquidity problems management expects that the company will need to curtail operations liquidate assets seek additional capital on less favourable terms andor pursue other remedial measures these interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern at  september  the company had suffered losses from exploration activities to date although management is currently attempting to implement its business plan and is seeking additional sources of equity or debt financing there is no assurance these activities will be successful accordingly the company must rely on its president to perform essential functions without compensation until a business operation can be commenced these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern the interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty          significant accounting policies     the following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these interim

environmental expenditures the operations of the company have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degrees by changes in environmental regulations including those for
