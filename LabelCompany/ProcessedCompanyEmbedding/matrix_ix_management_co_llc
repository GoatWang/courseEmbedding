portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore

am est more any business knows that to survive it has to have products that bring in money now and products that will bring in money in the future and identify which products are a drain on resources without potential to come back while its easy to identify the profitable products determining how the rest of your portfolio fits into the growth scheme can be harder the bcg matrix was designed as an analysis tool to help you determine the role of products on your future profit margin so you can decide where to invest created by the boston consulting group the bcg matrix – also known as the boston or growthshare matrix – provides a framework for analyzing products according to growth and market share the bcg matrix has been used since  to help companies gain insights on what products best help them capitalize on marketshare growth opportunities reeves martin senior partner and managing director of the boston consulting group said that nearly  years after its inception the bcg matrix remains a valuable tool for helping companies understand their potential creating your matrix first youll need data on the market share and growth rate of your products or services when examining market growth you need to objectively compare yourself to your largest competitor and think in terms of growth over the next three years if your market is extremely fragmented however you can use absolute market share instead according to the strategic thinker blog next you can either draw a matrix or find a bcg chart program online there are several that are free available for subscription or part of another charting program in this fourquadrant chart market share is shown on the horizontal line low left high right and growth rate along the vertical line low bottom high top the four quadrants are designated stars upper left question marks upper right cash cows lower left and dogs lower right credit deimoszshutterstock     place each of your products into the appropriate box based on where they rank in market share and growth where you choose to set the dividing line between each quadrant depends in part on how your company compares to the competition here is a breakdown of each quadrant stars the business units or products that have the best market share and generate the most cash are considered stars monopolies and firsttomarket products are frequently termed stars however because of their high growth rate stars also consume large amounts of cash this generally results in the same amount of money coming in that is going out stars can eventually become cash cows if they sustain their success until a time when the market growth rate declines companies are advised to invest in stars cash cows cash cows are the leaders in the marketplace and generate more cash than they consume these are business units or products that have a high market share but low growth prospects according to netmba cash cows provide the cash required to turn question marks into market leaders cover the administrative costs of the company fund research and development service the corporate debt and pay dividends to shareholders companies are advised to invest in cash cows to maintain the current level of productivity or to milk the gains passively dogs also known as pets dogs are units or products that have both a low market share and a low growth rate they frequently break even neither earning nor consuming a great deal of cash dogs are generally considered cash traps because businesses have money tied up in them even though they are bringing back basically nothing in return these business units are prime candidates for divestiture question marks these parts of a business have high growth prospects but a low market share they consume a lot of cash but bring little in return in the end question marks also known as problem children lose money however since these business units are growing rapidly they do have the potential to turn into stars companies are advised to invest in question marks if the product has potential for growth or to sell if it does not using the matrix to strategize now that you know where each business unit or product stands you can evaluate them objectively in an article on marketing  author hitesh bhasin outlines four potential strategies you can follow based on the results of your bcg matrix analysis build – increase investment in a product to increase its market share for example you can push a question mark into a star and finally a cash cow hold – if you cant invest more into a product hold it in the same quadrant and leave it be harvest – reduce your investment and try to take out the maximum cash flow from the product which increases its overall profitability best for cash cows divest – release the amount of money already stuck in the business best for dogs the article in strategic thinker notes that you want a balance you need products in every quadrant in order to keep a healthy cash flow and have products that can secure your future the role of cash flow in the matrix understanding cash flow is key to making the most of the bcg matrix in  bcg founder bruce henderson noted that four rules are responsible for product cash flow margins and cash generated are a function of market share high margins and high market share go together to grow you need to invest in your assets the added cash required to hold share is a function of growth rates high market share must be earned or bought buying market share requires an additional increment or investment no product market can grow indefinitely you need to get your payoff from growth when the growth slows you lose your opportunity if you hesitate the payoff is cash that cannot be reinvested in that product that last point is even more important now than ever the market moves more quickly now than it did  years ago and bcg has since published some recommended revisions to analyzing and acting on the matrix information keeping a healthy supply of question marks keeps you ready to act on the next trend while cash cows need to be milked efficiently because they may fall out of favor – and profitability – more quickly with a few tweaks the matrix can be adapted to help companies drive the strategic experimentation required for success even in unpredictable markets martin said the matrix needs to be applied with accelerated speed while balancing the investments between exploration in new segments and exploitation of established segments in addition the investments and divestments need to be managed rigorously while carefully measuring and monitoring the portfolio economics of experimentation you can find more strategies on bcgs website an alternative for another look while a great tool the bcg matrix isnt for everyone some businesses find they dont have products in each quadrant nor do they have steady movement of products among the quadrants as they progress in their life cycles some consultants advocate the use of the gemckinsey matrix instead the gemckinsey matrix offers more categorization options and measures products according to businessunit strength and industry attractiveness rather than market share the complexity of which may be outside an individual companys control comparing the two can reveal hidden insights that power more growth for your company templates and examples additional bcg matrix

kentoh matrix management is a technique of managing an organization or more commonly part of an organization through a series of dualreporting relationships instead of a more traditional linear management structure in contrast to most other organizational structures which arrange managers and employees by function or product matrix management combines functional and product departments in a dual authority system in its simplest form a matrix configuration may be known as a crossfunctional work team which brings together individuals who report to different parts of the company in order to complete a particular project or task the term matrix is derived from the representative diagram of a matrix management system which resembles a rectangular array or grid of functions and productproject groups the practice is most associated with highly collaborative and complex projects such as building aircraft but is also widely used in many productproject management situations even when a company does not label its structure a matrix system or represent it as such on an organization chart there may be an implicit matrix structure any time employees are grouped into work teams this does not normally include committees task forces and the like that are headed by someone other than their primary supervisor new organizational models in the late s and early s during the us industrial revolution a need emerged for more formalized structures in large business organizations the earliest models emphasized efficiency of process through managerial control described as mechanistic those systems were characterized by extensive rules and procedures centralized authority and an acute division of labor they sought to create organizations that mimicked machines and usually departmentalized workers by function such as finance and production important theories during that era included german sociologist max webers  ideal bureaucracy which was based on absolute authority logic and order during the s and s new ideas about the structure and nature of organizations began to surface inspired by the work of thinkers and behaviorists such as harvard researcher elton mayo who conducted the famed hawthorne experiments theories about management structure began to incorporate a more humanistic view those theoretical organizational structures were classified as organic and recognized the importance of human behavior and cultural influences in organizations while the mechanistic school of thought stressed efficiency and production through control organic models emphasized flexibility and adaptability through employee empowerment from a structural standpoint mechanistic organizations tended to be vertical or hierarchical with decisions flowing down through several channels organic models on the other hand were comparatively flat or horizontal and had few managerial levels or centralized controls many proponents of organic organizational theory believed it was the solution to the drawbacks of mechanistic organizations indeed mechanistic organizations often stifled human creativity and motivation and were generally insensitive to external influences such as shifting markets or consumer needs in contrast companies that used organic management structures tended to be more responsive and creative however many organizations that adopted the organic approach also discovered that among other drawbacks it sometimes lacked efficiency and personal accountability and failed to make the most productive use of some workers expertise as an alternative to basic organic structures many companies during the mids embraced a model that minimized the faults and maximized the benefits of different organic management structures as discussed below possibly the first application of what would later be referred to as the matrix structure was employed in  by general chemicals in its engineering department in the early s a more formalized matrix method called unit management was implemented by a large number of us hospitals not until  however was matrix management formally recognized the first organization to design and implement a formal matrix structure was the national aeronautics and space administration nasa nasa developed a matrix management system for its space program because it needed to simultaneously emphasize several different functions and projects none of which could be stressed at the expense of another it found that traditional management structures were too bureaucratic hierarchical slowmoving and inflexible likewise basic organic structures were too departmentalized ie myopic thus failing to productively use the farreaching expertise nasa had at its disposal nasas matrix solution overcame those problems by synthesizing projects such as designing a rocket booster with organizational functions such as staffing and finance despite doubts about its effectiveness in many applications matrix management gained broad acceptance in the corporate world during the s eventually achieving fad status its popularity continued during the s as a result of economic changes in the united states which included slowing domestic market growth and increasing foreign competition those changes forced many companies to seek the benefits offered by the matrix model matrix basics functional organization most organizational structures departmentalize the work force and other resources by one of two methods by products or by functions functional organizations are segmented by key functions for example activities related to production marketing and finance might be grouped into three respective divisions within each division moreover activities would be departmentalized into subdepartments the marketing division for example might encompass sales advertising and promotion departments the chief advantage of functionally structured organizations is that they usually achieve a fairly efficient specialization of labor and are relatively easy for employees to comprehend in addition functional structures reduce duplication of work because responsibilities are clearly defined on a companywide basis however functional division often causes departments to become shortsighted and provincial leading to incompatible work styles and poor communication divisional organization companies that employ a product or divisional structure by contrast break the organization down into semiautonomous units and profit centers based on activities or projects such as products customers or geography regardless of the project used to segment the company each unit operates as a separate business for example a company might be broken down into southern western and eastern divisions or it might create separate divisions for consumer industrial and institutional products again within each product unit are subdivisions one benefit of product or project departmentalization is that it facilitates expansion because the company can easily add a new division to focus on a new profit opportunity without having to significantly alter existing systems in addition accountability is increased because divisional performance can be measured more easily furthermore divisional structures permit decentralized decision making which allows managers with specific expertise to make key decisions in their area the potential drawbacks to divisional structures include duplication of efforts in different departments and a lack of horizontal communication in addition divisional organizations like functionally structured companies may have trouble keeping all departments focused on an overall company goal matrix organization matrix management structures combine functional and product departmentalization they simultaneously organize part of a company along product or project lines and part of it around functional lines to get the advantages of both for example a diagram of a matrix model might show divisions such as different product groups along the top of a table see figure  along the left side of the same table would be different functional departments such as finance marketing and production within the matrix each of the product groups would intersect with each of the functional groups signifying a direct relationship between product teams and administrative divisions in other words each team of people assigned to manage a product group might have an individuals who also belonged to each of the functional departments and viceversa theoretically managers of project groups and managers of functional groups have roughly equal authority within the company as indicated by the matrix many employees report to at least two managers for instance a member of the accounting department might be assigned to work with the consumer products division and would report to managers of both departments generally however managers of functional areas and divisions report to a single authority such as a president or vice president although all matrix structures entail some form of dual authority and multidisciplinary grouping there are several variations for example kenneth knight identified three basic matrix management models coordination overlay and secondment each of the models can be implemented in various forms that differ in attributes related to decisionmaking roles relationships with outside suppliers and buyers and other factors organizations choose different models based on such factors as competitive environments industries education and maturity level of the workforce and existing corporate culture in the coordination model staff members remains part of their original departments or the departments they would most likely belong to under a functional or product structure procedures are instituted to ensure crossdepartmental cooperation and interaction towards the achievement of extradepartmental goals in the overlay model staff members officially become members of two groups each of which has a separate manager this model represents the undiluted matrix form described above in the third version the secondment model individuals move from functional departments into project groups and back again but may effectively belong to one or the other at different times figure  matrix organizational structure temporary versus permanent as these examples and models suggest matrix structures are more likely than other structures to exist on a temporary or ad hoc basis indeed some scholars group matrix structures under a broader category of organizational forms called adhocracies or temporary work configurations created to deal with a particular problem or project largescale use of adhocracies dates to us military practices during world war ii when the war effort required flexible teams of experts to be convened on short notice and delegated certain tasks often without a great deal of micromanagement by military brass once the objectives were reached the team would be disbanded and the members reassigned to other duties a similar rationale and process exist in the business world and thus many formal matrix structures fall into the ad hoc category permanent matrix structures are centered on more enduring aspects of business operations such as product lines or processes a common practice is to have a product or brand manager who is responsible for overseeing the development and production of an ongoing product but staff who work on the product may also contribute to other products from time to time this permanent setup creates accountability coordination and perhaps most of all continuity for the product as a whole while enabling staff who generally have a direct supervisor who is not a product manager to be flexibly assigned where they are needed most advantages disadvantages and applications advantages the cardinal advantage of a matrix structure is that it facilitates rapid response to change in two or more environments for instance a telecommunications company might be extremely concerned about both unforeseen geographic opportunities and limited capital by departmentalizing its company with the financial function on one axis and the geographic areas on the other it might benefit from having each of its geographic units intertwined with its finance department for example suppose that an opportunity to purchase the cellular telephone rights for a specific area arose the matrix structure would allow the company to quickly determine if it had the capital necessary to purchase the license and develop the area or if it should take advantage of an opportunity in another region matrix structures are flatter and more responsive than other types of structures because they permit more efficient exchanges of information because people from different departments are cooperating so closely they are eager to share data that will help them achieve common goals in effect the entire organization becomes an information web data is channeled both vertically and horizontally as people exchange technical knowledge marketing data product ideas financial information to make decisions in addition to speed and flexibility matrix organization may result in a more efficient use of resources than other organic structures this occurs because highly specialized employees and equipment are shared by departments for example if the expertise of a computer programmer is needed in another department he or she can move to that department to solve its problems rather than languishing on tasks of low priority as might happen in a nonmatrix setting other benefits of matrix management include improved motivation and more adept managers improved motivation results from decisionmaking within groups becoming more democratic and participatory because each member brings specialized knowledge to the table—and since employees have a direct impact on daytoday decisions they are more likely to experience higher levels of motivation and commitment to the goals of the departments to which they belong more adept management is the result of top decision makers becoming more involved in and thus better informed about the daytoday operations of the company this involvement can also lead to improved longterm planning disadvantages despite their many theoretical advantages matrix management structures have been criticized as having a number of weaknesses for instance they are typically expensive to maintain partly because of more complex reporting requirements in addition many workers become disturbed by the lack of a chain of command and a seeming inability to perceive who is in charge indeed among the most common criticisms of matrix management is that it results in role ambiguity and conflict for instance a functional manager may tell a subordinate one thing and then a productproject boss will tell him or her something different as a result companies that change from a comparatively bureaucratic structure to matrix management often experience high turnover and worker dissatisfaction supporting critics derision of matrix management are several examples of companies that have implemented and later abandoned matrix structures for example one study showed that between  and  about onequarter of all teaching hospitals in the united states moved to unit or matrix management structures by the late s though nearly onethird of those hospitals had rejected the concept citing reasons such as high costs excessive turnover and interpersonal conflict although the hospital study suggested that matrix management was better suited to larger organizations general motors corps experience indicated otherwise after a sevenyear test of a matrix structure gm jettisoned matrix management in the s in favor of a more traditional product oriented organizational structure it cited managers lack of control over incentives as a primary shortcoming of the matrix system although matrix management was often viewed during the s as a cureall for organizational design the perceived breadth of its potential for application has gradually diminished in general matrix structures are assumed to be most appropriate for larger corporations that operate in unique or fastpaced environments a coalmining company for example might be less likely to benefit from a matrix structure than would a pharmaceutical company matrix management also works best for organizations that are managed and staffed mostly by professionals or semiprofessionals eg engineers and scientists matrix management further requires a workforce that has a diverse set of skills and employees that have strong interpersonal abilities finally matrix management is usually more effective when a project manager who is technically working under the authority of a product and a functional boss is given the authority to make critical decisions because of their limitations matrix management structures frequently are integrated into an organization as one facet of a larger plan for example a research team organized to develop a new product might be placed in a division of the company that is set up as a matrix after the initial stages of the project are completed the ongoing management of the product might be moved to a division of the company that reflects a more conventional functional or productproject structure indeed as evidenced by nasas successes in the s matrix management is particularly effective in accomplishing crash and hightech projects such as those related to medical energy research aerospace defense and competitive threats matrix structure in international settings a special and popular application of matrix management is in the overseas operations of an international firm this is sometimes known as a three dimensional matrix when management intersects along productmarket function and country lines under such an arrangement there is typically a worldwide product manager a local or worldwide functional manager and a country specific manager however many variations of the international matrix exist the product manager is generally concerned with productspecific issues that cut across regional or national boundaries depending on the type of task and the companys preference the functional manager may focus on international issues eg worldwide finance or local concerns eg domestic finance finally the country manager is concerned with all the implications—both product and function—of producing andor marketing the goods or services in a particular locale as with other uses of the matrix structure the international format is not without its weaknesses a particular concern is the role of ambiguity across international lines and especially when it pits managers of different nationalities against one another if the system is not handled carefully and the potential for cultural bias recognized by top management it could lead to favoritism of some international managers while disenfranchising others thereby defeating the purpose of a matrix structure in addition international matrix structures may be unacceptably inefficient and costly to maintain case study bayer ag of germany—the company best known in the united states for its bayer aspirin products—is one of the largest and oldest chemical and healthcare products companies in the world because of massive sales gains and increased activity overseas in the early s bayer announced a reorganization in  bayer had been successful with a conventional organizational structure that was departmentalized by function however in response to new conditions the company wanted to create a structure that would allow it to achieve three primary goals  shift management control from the thenwest german parent company to its foreign divisions and subsidiaries  restructure its business divisions to more clearly define their duties and  flatten the organization or empower lower level managers to assume more responsibility so that top executives would have more time to plan strategy bayer selected a relatively diverse matrix management format to pursue its goals it delineated all of its business activities into six groups under an umbrella company called bayer world within each of the six groups were several subgroups made up of product categories such as dyestuffs fibers or chemicals likewise each of its administrative and service functions were regrouped under bayer world into one of several functions such as human resources marketing plant administration or finance furthermore top managers who had formally headed functional groups were given authority over separate geographic regions which like the product groups were supported by and entwined with the functional groups the net effect of the reorganization was that the original nine functional departments were broken down into  multidisciplinary interconnected business groups after only one year of operation bayer management lauded the new matrix structure as a resounding success not only did matrix management allow the company to move toward its primary goals but it had the added benefits of increasing its responsiveness to change and emerging opportunities and of helping bayer to streamline plant administration and

issue explore the archive loading toplevel managers in many of today’s leading corporations are losing control of their companies the problem is not that they have misjudged the demands created by an increasingly complex environment and an accelerating rate of environmental change nor even that they have failed to develop strategies appropriate to the new challenges the problem is that their companies are organizationally incapable of carrying out the sophisticated strategies they have developed over the past  years strategic thinking has far outdistanced organizational capabilities all through the s companies everywhere were redefining their strategies and reconfiguring their operations in response to such developments as the globalization of markets the intensification of competition the acceleration of product life cycles and the growing complexity of relationships with suppliers customers employees governments even competitors but as companies struggled with these changing environmental realities many fell into one of two traps—one strategic one structural the strategic trap was to implement simple static solutions to complex and dynamic problems the bait was often a consultant’s siren song promising to simplify or at least minimize complexity and discontinuity despite the new demands of overlapping industry boundaries and greatly altered valueadded chains managers were promised success if they would “stick to their knitting” in a swiftly changing international political economy they were urged to rein in dispersed overseas operations and focus on the triad markets and in an increasingly intricate and sophisticated competitive environment they were encouraged to choose between alternative generic strategies—low cost or differentiation yet the strategic reality for most companies was that both their business and their environment really were more complex while the proposed solutions were often simple even simplistic the traditional telephone company that stuck to its knitting was trampled by competitors who redefined their strategies in response to new technologies linking telecommunications computers and office equipment into a single integrated system the packagedgoods company that concentrated on the triad markets quickly discovered that europe japan and the united states were the epicenters of global competitive activity with higher risks and slimmer profits than more protected and less competitive markets such as australia turkey and brazil the consumer electronics company that adopted an eitheror generic strategy found itself facing competitors able to develop cost and differentiation capabilities at the same time in recent years as more and more managers recognized oversimplification as a strategic trap they began to accept the need to manage complexity rather than seek to minimize it this realization however led many into an equally threatening organizational trap when they concluded that the best response to increasingly complex strategic requirements was increasingly complex organizational structures the obvious organizational solution to strategies that required multiple simultaneous management capabilities was the matrix structure that became so fashionable in the late s and the early s its parallel reporting relationships acknowledged the diverse conflicting needs of functional product and geographic management groups and provided a formal mechanism for resolving them its multiple information channels allowed the organization to capture and analyze external complexity and its overlapping responsibilities were designed to combat parochialism and build flexibility into the company’s response to change in practice however the matrix proved all but unmanageable—especially in an international context dual reporting led to conflict and confusion the proliferation of channels created informational logjams as a proliferation of committees and reports bogged down the organization and overlapping responsibilities produced turf battles and a loss of accountability separated by barriers of distance language time and culture managers found it virtually impossible to clarify the confusion and resolve the conflicts in hindsight the strategic and structural traps seem simple enough to avoid so one has to wonder why so many experienced general managers have fallen into them much of the answer lies in the way we have traditionally thought about the general manager’s role for decades we have seen the general manager as chief strategic guru and principal organizational architect but as the competitive climate grows less stable and less predictable it is harder for one person alone to succeed in that great visionary role similarly as formal hierarchical structure gives way to networks of personal relationships that work through informal horizontal communication channels the image of top management in an isolated corner office moving boxes and lines on an organization chart becomes increasingly anachronistic paradoxically as strategies and organizations become more complex and sophisticated toplevel general managers are beginning to replace their historical concentration on the grand issues of strategy and structure with a focus on the details of managing people and processes the critical strategic requirement is not to devise the most ingenious and wellcoordinated plan but to build the most viable and flexible strategic process the key organizational task is not to design the most elegant structure but to capture individual capabilities and motivate the entire organization to respond cooperatively to a complicated and dynamic environment building an organization although business thinkers have written a great deal about strategic innovation they have paid far less attention to the accompanying organizational challenges yet many companies remain caught in the structuralcomplexity trap that paralyzes their ability to respond quickly or flexibly to the new strategic imperatives for those companies that adopted matrix structures the problem was not in the way they defined the goal they correctly recognized the need for a multidimensional organization to respond to growing external complexity the problem was that they defined their organizational objectives in purely structural terms yet the term formal structure describes only the organization’s basic anatomy companies must also concern themselves with organizational physiology—the systems and relationships that allow the lifeblood of information to flow through the organization they also need to develop a healthy organizational psychology—the shared norms values and beliefs that shape the way individual managers think and act the companies that fell into the organizational trap assumed that changing their formal structure anatomy would force changes in interpersonal relationships and decision processes physiology which in turn would reshape the individual attitudes and actions of managers psychology but as many companies have discovered reconfiguring the formal structure is a blunt and sometimes brutal instrument of change a new structure creates new and presumably more useful managerial ties but these can take months and often years to evolve into effective knowledgegenerating and decisionmaking relationships and because the new job requirements will frustrate alienate or simply overwhelm so many managers changes in individual attitudes and behavior will likely take even longer as companies struggle to create organizational capabilities that reflect rather than diminish environmental complexity good managers gradually stop searching for the ideal structural template to impose on the company from the top down instead they focus on the challenge of building up an appropriate set of employee attitudes and skills and linking them together with carefully developed processes and relationships in other words they begin to focus on building the organization rather than simply on installing a new structure indeed the companies that are most successful at developing multidimensional organizations begin at the far end of the anatomyphysiologypsychology sequence their first objective is to alter the organizational psychology—the broad corporate beliefs and norms that shape managers’ perceptions and actions then by enriching and clarifying communication and decision processes companies reinforce these psychological changes with improvements in organizational physiology only later do they consolidate and confirm their progress by realigning organizational anatomy through changes in the formal structure no company we know of has discovered a quick or easy way to change its organizational psychology to reshape the understanding identification and commitment of its employees but we found three principal characteristics common to those that managed the task most effectively  they developed and communicated a clear and consistent corporate vision  they effectively managed human resource tools to broaden individual perspectives and to develop identification with corporate goals  they integrated individual thinking and activities into the broad corporate agenda by a process we call cooption building a shared vision perhaps the main reason managers in large complex companies cling to parochial attitudes is that their frame of reference is bounded by their specific responsibilities the surest way to break down such insularity is to develop and communicate a clear sense of corporate purpose that extends into every corner of the company and gives context and meaning to each manager’s particular roles and responsibilities we are not talking about a slogan however catchy and pointed we are talking about a company vision which must be crafted and articulated with clarity continuity and consistency we are talking about clarity of expression that makes company objectives understandable and meaningful continuity of purpose that underscores their enduring importance and consistency of application across business units and geographical boundaries that ensures uniformity throughout the organization clarity there are three keys to clarity in a corporate vision simplicity relevance and reinforcement nec’s integration of computers and communications—cc—is probably the best single example of how simplicity can make a vision more powerful top management has applied the cc concept so effectively that it describes the company’s business focus defines its distinctive source of competitive advantage over large companies like ibm and att and summarizes its strategic and organizational imperatives the second key relevance means linking broad objectives to concrete agendas when wisse dekker became ceo at philips his principal strategic concern was the problem of competing with japan he stated this challenge in martial terms—the us had abandoned the battlefield philips was now europe’s last defense against insurgent japanese electronics companies by focusing the company’s attention not only on philips’s corporate survival but also on the protection of national and regional interests dekker heightened the sense of urgency and commitment in a way that legitimized costcutting efforts drove an extensive rationalization of plant operations and inspired a new level of sales achievements the third key to clarity is top management’s continual reinforcement elaboration and interpretation of the core vision to keep it from becoming obsolete or abstract founder konosuke matsushita developed a grand  year vision for his company but he also managed to give it immediate relevance he summed up its overall message in the “seven spirits of matsushita” to which he referred constantly in his policy statements each january he wove the company’s oneyear operational objectives into his overarching concept to produce an annual theme that he then captured in a slogan for all the loftiness of his concept of corporate purpose he gave his managers immediate concrete guidance in implementing matsushita’s goals continuity despite shifts in leadership and continual adjustments in shortterm business priorities companies must remain committed to the same core set of strategic objectives and organizational values without such continuity unifying vision might as well be expressed in terms of quarterly goals it was general electric’s lack of this kind of continuity that led to the erosion of its once formidable position in electrical appliances in many countries over a period of  years and under successive ceos the company’s international consumerproduct strategy never stayed the same for long from building locally responsive and selfsufficient “miniges” in each market the company turned to a policy of developing lowcost offshore sources which eventually evolved into a de facto strategy of international outsourcing finally following its acquisition of rca ge’s consumer electronics strategy made another aboutface and focused on building centralized scale to defend domestic share meanwhile the product strategy within this shifting business emphasis was itself unstable the brazilian subsidiary for example built its tv business in the s until it was told to stop in the early s it emphasized large appliances until it was denied funding then it focused on housewares until the parent company sold off that business in two decades ge utterly dissipated its dominant franchise in brazil’s electrical products market unilever by contrast made an enduring commitment to its brazilian subsidiary despite volatile swings in brazil’s business climate company chairman floris maljers emphasized the importance of looking past the latest political crisis or economic downturn to the longterm business potential “in those parts of the world” he remarked “you take your management cues from the way they dance the samba method of management is two steps forward then one step back” unilever built—two steps forward and one step back—a profitable  million business in a rapidly growing economy with  million consumers while its wallflower competitors never ventured out onto the floor consistency the third task for top management in communicating strategic purpose is to ensure that everyone in the company shares the same vision the cost of inconsistency can be horrendous it always produces confusion and in extreme cases can lead to total chaos with different units of the organization pursuing agendas that are mutually debilitating philips is a good example of a company that for a time lost its consistency of corporate purpose as a legacy of its wartime decision to give some overseas units legal autonomy management had long experienced difficulty persuading north american philips nap to play a supportive role in the parent company’s global strategies the problem came to a head with the introduction of philips’s technologically firstrate videocassette recording system the v despite considerable pressure from world headquarters in the netherlands nap refused to launch the system arguing that sony’s beta system and matsushita’s vhs format were too well established and had cost feature and systemsupport advantages philips couldn’t match relying on its legal independence and managerial autonomy nap management decided instead to source products from its japanese competitors and market them under its magnavox brand name as a result philips was unable to build the efficiency and credibility it needed to challenge japanese dominance of the vcr business most inconsistencies involve differences between what managers of different operating units see as the company’s key objectives sometimes however different corporate leaders transmit different views of overall priorities and purpose when this stems from poor communication it can be fixed when it’s a result of fundamental disagreement the problem is serious indeed as illustrated by itt’s problems in developing its strategically vital system  switching equipment continuing differences between the head of the european organization and the company’s chief technology officer over the location and philosophy of the development effort led to confusion and conflict throughout the company the result was disastrous itt had difficulty transferring vital technology across its own unit boundaries and so was irreparably late introducing this key product to a rapidly changing global market these problems eventually led the company to sell off its core telecommunications business to a competitor but formulating and communicating a vision—no matter how clear enduring and consistent—cannot succeed unless individual employees understand and accept the company’s stated goals and objectives problems at this level are more often related to receptivity than to communication the development of individual understanding and acceptance is a challenge for a company’s human resource practices developing human resources while top managers universally recognize their responsibility for developing and allocating a company’s scarce assets and resources their focus on finance and technology often overshadows the task of developing the scarcest resource of all—capable managers but if there is one key to regaining control of companies that operate in fastchanging environments it is the ability of top management to turn the perceptions capabilities and relationships of individual managers into the building blocks of the organization one pervasive problem in companies whose leaders lack this ability—or fail to exercise it—is getting managers to see how their specific responsibilities relate to the broad corporate vision growing external complexity and strategic sophistication have accelerated the growth of a cadre of specialists who are physically and organizationally isolated from each other and the task of dealing with their consequent parochialism should not be delegated to the clerical staff that administers salary structures and benefit programs top managers inside and outside the human resource function must be leaders in the recruitment development and assignment of the company’s vital human talent recruitment and selection the first step in successfully managing complexity is to tap the full range of available talent it is a serious mistake to permit historical imbalances in the nationality or functional background of the management group to constrain hiring or subsequent promotion in today’s global marketplace domestically oriented recruiting limits a company’s ability to capitalize on its worldwide pool of management skill and biases its decisionmaking processes after decades of routinely appointing managers from its domestic operations to key positions in overseas subsidiaries procter  gamble realized that the practice not only worked against sensitivity to local cultures—a lesson driven home by several marketing failures in japan—but also greatly underutilized its pool of highpotential nonamerican managers fortunately our studies turned up few companies as shortsighted as one that made overseas assignments on the basis of poor performance because foreign markets were assumed to be “not as tough as the domestic environment” not only must companies enlarge the pool of people available for key positions they must also develop new criteria for choosing those most likely to succeed because past success is no longer a sufficient qualification for increasingly subtle sensitive and unpredictable seniorlevel tasks top management must become involved in a more discriminating selection process at matsushita top management selects candidates for international assignments on the basis of a comprehensive set of personal characteristics expressed for simplicity in the acronym smile specialty the needed skill capability or knowledge management ability particularly motivational ability international flexibility willingness to learn and ability to adapt language facility and endeavor vitality perseverance in the face of difficulty these attributes are remarkably similar to those targeted by nec and philips where top executives also are involved in the seniorlevel selection process training and development once the appropriate toplevel candidates have been identified the next challenge is to develop their potential the most successful development efforts have three aims that take them well beyond the skillbuilding objectives of classic training programs to inculcate a common vision and shared values to broaden management perspectives and capabilities and to develop contacts and shape management relationships to build common vision and values whitecollar employees at matsushita spend a good part of their first six months in what the company calls “cultural and spiritual training” they study the company credo the “seven spirits of matsushita” and the philosophy of konosuke matsushita then they learn how to translate these internalized lessons into daily behavior and even operational decisions culturebuilding exercises as intensive as matsushita’s are sometimes dismissed as innate japanese practices that would not work in other societies but in fact philips has a similar entrylevel training practice called “organization cohesion training” as does unilever called straightforwardly “indoctrination” the second objective—broadening management perspectives—is essentially a matter of teaching people how to manage complexity instead of merely to make room for it to reverse a long and unwieldy tradition of running its operations with two and threeheaded management teams of separate technical commercial and sometimes administrative specialists philips asked its training and development group to despecialize top management trainees by supplementing its traditional menu of specialist courses and functional programs with more intensive general management training philips was able to begin replacing the ubiquitous teams with single business heads who also appreciated and respected specialist points of view the final aim—developing contacts and relationships—is much more than an incidental byproduct of good management development as the comments of a senior personnel manager at unilever suggest “by bringing managers from different countries and businesses together at four acres unilever’s international managementtraining college we build contacts and create bonds that we could never achieve by other means the company spends as much on training as it does on rd not only because of the direct effect it has on upgrading skills and knowledge but also because it plays a central role in indoctrinating managers into a unilever club where personal relationships and informal contacts are much more powerful than the formal systems and structures” careerpath management although recruitment and training are critically important the most effective companies recognize that the best way to develop new perspectives and thwart parochialism in their managers is through personal experience by moving selected managers across functions businesses and geographic units a company encourages crossfertilization of ideas as well as the flexibility and breadth of experience that enable managers to grapple with complexity and come out on top unilever has long been committed to the development of its human resources as a means of attaining durable competitive advantage as early as the s the company was recruiting and developing local employees to replace the parentcompany managers who had been running most of its overseas subsidiaries in a practice that came to be known as “ization” the company committed itself to the indianization of its indian company the australization of its australian company and so on although delighted with the new talent that began working its way up through the organization management soon realized that by reducing the transfer of parentcompany managers abroad it had diluted the powerful glue that bound diverse organizational groups together and linked dispersed operations the answer lay in formalizing a second phase of the ization process while continuing with indianization for example unilever added programs aimed at the “unileverization” of its indian managers in addition to bringing  to  managers to four acres each year unilever typically has  to  of its most promising overseas managers on short and longterm job assignments at corporate headquarters this policy not only brings fresh closetothemarket perspectives into corporate decision making but also gives the visiting managers a strong sense of unilever’s strategic vision and organizational values in the words of one of the expatriates in the corporate offices “the experience initiates you into the unilever club and the clear norms values and behaviors that distinguish our people—so much so that we really believe we can spot another unilever manager anywhere in the world” furthermore the company carefully transfers most of these highpotential individuals through a variety of different functional product and geographic positions often rotating every two or three years most important top management tracks about  of these people—some  of unilever’s total management group—who as they move through the company forge an informal network of contacts and relationships that is central to unilever’s decisionmaking and informationexchange processes widening the perspectives and relationships of key managers as unilever has done is a good way of developing identification with the broader corporate mission but a broad sense of identity is not enough to maintain control of its global strategies unilever must secure a strong and lasting individual commitment to corporate visions and objectives in effect it must coopt individual energies and ambitions into the service of corporate goals coopting management efforts as organizational complexity grows managers and management groups tend to become so specialized and isolated and to focus so intently on their own immediate operating responsibilities that they are apt to respond parochially to intrusions on their organizational turf even when the overall corporate interest is at stake a classic example described earlier was the decision by north american philips’s consumer electronics group to reject the parent company’s vcr system at about the same time philips like many other companies began experimenting with ways to convert managers’ intellectual understanding of the corporate vision—in philips’s case an almost evangelical determination to defend western electronics against the japanese—into a binding personal commitment philips concluded that it could coopt individuals and organizational groups into the broader vision by inviting them to contribute to the corporate agenda and then giving them direct responsibility for implementation in the face of intensifying japanese competition philips knew it had to improve coordination in its consumer electronics among its fiercely independent national organizations in strengthening the central product divisions however philips did not want to deplete the enterprise or commitment of its capable national management teams the company met these conflicting needs with two crossborder initiatives first it created a toplevel world policy council for its video business that included key managers from strategic markets—germany france the united kingdom the united states and japan philips knew that its national companies’ long history of independence made local managers reluctant to take orders from dutch headquarters in eindhoven—often for good reason because much of the company’s best market knowledge and technological expertise resided in its offshore units through the council philips coopted their support for company decisions about product policy and manufacturing location second in a more powerful move philips allocated global responsibilities to units that previously had been purely national in focus eindhoven gave nap the leading role in the development of philips’s projection television and asked it to coordinate development and manufacture of all philips television sets for north america and asia the change in the attitude of nap managers was dramatic a senior manager in nap’s consumer electronics business summed up the feelings of us managers “at last we are moving out of the dependency relationship with eindhoven that was so frustrating to us” cooption had transformed the defensive territorial attitude of nap managers into a more collaborative mindset they were making important contributions to global corporate strategy instead of looking for ways to subvert it in  with much of its tv set production established in mexico the president of nap’s consumer electronics group told the press “it is the commonality of design that makes it possible for us to move production globally we have splendid cooperation with philips in eindhoven” it was a statement no nap manager would have made a few years earlier and it perfectly captured how effectively philips had coopted previously isolated even adversarial managers into the corporate agenda the matrix in the manager’s mind since the end of world war ii corporate strategy has survived several generations of painful transformation and has grown appropriately agile and athletic unfortunately organizational development has not kept pace and managerial attitudes lag even farther behind as a result corporations now commonly design strategies that seem impossible to implement for the simple reason that no one can effectively implement thirdgeneration strategies through secondgeneration organizations run by firstgeneration managers today the most successful companies are those where top executives recognize the need to manage the new environmental and competitive demands by focusing less on the quest for an ideal structure and more on developing the abilities behavior and performance of individual managers change succeeds only when those assigned to the new transnational and interdependent tasks understand the overall goals and are dedicated to achieving them one senior executive put it this way “the challenge is not so much to build a matrix structure as it is to create a matrix in the minds of our managers” the inbuilt conflict in a matrix structure pulls managers in several directions at once developing a matrix of flexible perspectives and relationships within each manager’s mind however achieves an entirely different result it lets individuals make the judgments and negotiate the tradeoffs that drive the organization toward a shared strategic objective a version of this article
