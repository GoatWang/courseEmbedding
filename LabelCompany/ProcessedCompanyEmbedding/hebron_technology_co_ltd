of approximately  from this offering if the minimum offering is sold and approximately  if the maximum offering is sold the net proceeds from this offering must be remitted to china before we will be able to use the funds to grow our business the procedure to remit funds may take several months after completion of this offering and we will be unable to use the funds in china until remittance is completed we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows after we complete the remittance process and we have ordered the specific uses of proceeds in order of priority we do not expect that our priorities for fund allocation would change if the amount we raise in this offering exceeds the size of the minimum offering but is less than the maximum offering we expect to devote any funds raised over the minimum offering amount to our working capital needs including devoting further resources to the below uses of proceeds estimated amount of net estimated amount proceeds of net proceeds description of use minimum offering maximum offering expansion of installation services     development of repair and maintenance business   establishment of online store of products and

repair and maintenance services after the expiration of their product and installation service warranties we have established a repair and maintenance center in nanjing jiangsu province to cover eastern china jiangsu province zhejiang province anhui province and shanghai with an investment of rmb  approximately  over the next  years we plan to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to establish five additional repair and maintenance centers in shanghai beijing nanjing chengdu and linyi respectively to cover central china northeastern china northern china southern china and northwestern china with shanghai being the center we anticipate that the proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to fund these new centers to the extent we raise proceeds upon maximum offering we would further devote more proceeds to increase the size and scope of each repair and maintenance center  we anticipate using a portion of this offering to settle taxes due for the company the amount of taxes due is not presently determinable and may exceed the amount allocated to this item to the extent this is the case we anticipate using operating cash flows from the company to cover such shortfall however we cannot guarantee that such operating cash flows will be available in order to grow our installation services business we need to be able to perform more projects at the same time due to limited unrestricted cash to pay for advances to subcontractors in different projects we are generally limited to two projects at the same time with the proceeds from this offering we will aim to conduct two to four more projects simultaneously as the capacity to perform more projects at the same time increases we plan to add three more branch offices with six new employees for sales or technology support to each new office to guarantee our services to clients we expect the new branch offices will be located in linyi in shandong province chengdu in sichuan province and nanjing in jiangsu province in addition to the current one in nanjing respectively we currently do not have any plans to expand our installation services through acquiring any assets or businesses in addition we intend to establish an online store for our products and services with the net proceeds from this offering with the help from an unrelated thirdparty web design and maintenance company we have already initially set up our own online store website in the form of a businesstobusiness platform though the website is set up it is still in the process of technical testing and improvement without being promoted or operated we will develop our own operation administration internet technology team online store maintenance offices product storage and logistic and delivery center to provide our customers with online consulting online ordering delivery installation and aftersales service we plan to begin by building our online store team and facilities to conduct market research and analysis about online store operation when we complete our analysis we will maintain our platform website test and promote the website and put it into daily operation we will also provide initial consulting services regarding our holistic production technique solution services for pharmaceutical engineering and food manufacturing systems we currently do not have any plans to use any thirdparty online stores as our platform for online service also we do not currently plan to establish our online store through acquiring any assets or businesses pending use of the net proceeds we intend to invest our net proceeds in shortterm interest bearing investmentgrade obligations these investments may have a material adverse effect on the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in our common shares it is possible that we may become a passive foreign investment company for us federal income taxpayers which could result in negative tax consequences to you the market for installation service in the pharmaceutical industry in china is relatively competitive and some of our competitors have a much longer operating history and larger customer base than we do  we plan to compete domestically by establishing new branch offices in more cities in china currently we plan to add three more branch offices in linyi chengdu and nanjing we will also develop our online store which will enable our customers to communicate with us online and order purchase and have our products and services delivered in a more convenient and faster manner with the proceeds of this offering we plan to increase our capacity to conduct  to  more service projects at a time to expand our business as mentioned above we expect to recruit more employees to ensure service quality and efficiency most of our service customers are companies in the biological pharmaceutical industry which is an industry with great development potential and customer demand in china we compete on the basis of the experience and technology we have developed in serving customers in this industry for over  years in addition our holistic biological pharmaceutical engineering solution services combine product manufacturing installation and aftersales services most of our competitors in this area only install the components they purchase from third parties without capacity to manufacture on their own while most of our product provider competitors focus on producing products without installation services we not only produce our own products through research and development but also provide installation and aftersales services if any problem occurs after sales or installation our customers can look to us for product and installation support rather than having to reach out to other service providers if customers face issues outside our specialty we can contact the appropriate subcontractors to ensure that our customers’ needs are met and they need only look to us for help we have a professional team with product research and development staff production staff installation service staff and project designers we have focused on providing high quality services quickly and at a low price we are able to reduce the overall price of the projects we perform by producing some of the components because we produce lots of components and we stock different products in a proper proportion based on experience with market demand it normally takes us only a short time to complete the projects with less likelihood of delay due to shortages of components from other suppliers also our products and pricing can be easily tailored to the customers’ needs and we price our products aggressively we have short cycles in providing products on average it takes only one week from receiving orders to delivery to the customer all of our products are in compliance with gmp standards we pride ourselves on high quality services and products so that our customers receive good value for the price they pay our primary competitors are the following companies we have set forth our assessment of our companies’ relative strengths and challenges this table represents our belief about our competitive position and is based on our observations rather than objective data our assessment may not be shared by others including such competitors but it does represent management’s assessment of our industry
