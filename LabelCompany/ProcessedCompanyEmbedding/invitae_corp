the sale of shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately  million based on the initial public offering price after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters option to purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full we estimate that we will receive additional net proceeds of  million the principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to support our operations increase our visibility in the marketplace establish a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to the public capital markets we currently intend to use the proceeds from this offering as follows  between approximately  million and  million for research and development including assay development software development for our analysis pipeline and our clinical report optimization platform or crop  between approximately  million and  million for selling and marketing activities including development and operation of our web site for taking and delivering customer orders hiring sales customer service and marketing personnel and marketing programs including attendance at conferences  between approximately  million and  million for capital expenditures including investment in additional laboratory capacity sample preparation and sequencing equipment and computer systems for generating analyzing and storing genetic information and  the remainder for corporate and administrative expenses including personnel related costs and costs associated with operating as a public company and for working capital and other general corporate purposes the expected use of the net proceeds from this offering described above represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors including competitive and technological developments the number of billable tests we perform our success in obtaining reimbursement our ability to lower the costs associated with performing our tests the amount of cash generated by our operations the timing and amount of investments in our business demand for tests with expanded genetic content demand for enhancement of our analysis pipeline and crop to service greater assay volume potentially at reduced turnaround times utilization of our website for taking and delivering customer orders the need for sales customer service and marketing personnel to drive demand and address customer requirements and the need for increased amounts of laboratory capacity sample preparation and sequencing equipment and computer systems for generating analyzing and storing genetic information if our development of additional assays or systems requires more resources than we anticipate we may allocate additional proceeds from this offering to our research and development activities if market acceptance of and reimbursement for our assays is slower than we anticipate we may reallocate a portion of the proceeds from research and development and capital expenditures to selling and marketing activities we may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to license acquire or invest in complementary business technologies products or assets however we have no current plans commitments or obligations to do so accordingly our

proceeds in short and intermediateterm interestbearing obligations investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government our competitors include companies that offer molecular genetic testing services including specialty and reference laboratories that offer traditional single and multigene tests principal competitors include companies such as myriad genetics ambry genetics genedx a subsidiary of bioreference laboratories laboratory corporation of america and quest diagnostics as well as other commercial and academic labs in addition to the companies that currently offer traditional genetic testing services and research centers other established and emerging healthcare information technology and service companies may commercialize competitive products including informatics analysis integrated genetic tools and services for health and wellness we believe the principal competitive factors in our market are  price and quality of tests  turnaround time of testing results  coverage and reimbursement arrangements with thirdparty payors  breadth and depth of content  convenience of testing  brand recognition of test provider  additional valueadded services and informatics tools  accessibility of results  client service  quality of website content and  reliability we believe that we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors however many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and market penetration substantially greater financial technological and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities more experience dealing with thirdparty payors as a result they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer requirements devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their tests than we do or sell their tests at prices designed to win significant levels of market share we may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations company description invitaes mission is to bring comprehensive genetic information into mainstream medical practice to improve the quality of healthcare for billions of people our goal is to aggregate most of the worlds genetic tests into a single service with higher quality faster turnaround time and lower price than many single gene tests today we were founded on four core principles  patients should own and control their own genetic information  healthcare professionals are fundamental in ordering and interpreting genetic information  genetic information is more valuable when shared and  driving down the price of genetic information will increase its clinical and personal utility as the price of dna sequencing has declined the amount of genetic information that can be generated per dollar has increased exponentially enabling the generation analysis and storage of more comprehensive genetic information than ever before according to online mendelian inheritence in man or omim a compendium of human genes maintained by johns hopkins university school of medicine there are more than  inherited genetic conditions for which the scientific and medical community has already identified specific genes and variants useful for diagnosis or treatment planning by aggregating large numbers of currently available genetic tests into a single service we can achieve great economies of scale that allow us to not only provide primary single gene or multigene tests but also to generate and store additional genetic information on behalf of the patient for future use we refer to the service of managing genetic information over the course of disease or the lifetime of a patient as genome management in addition as more individuals gain access to their genetic information we believe that sharing genetic information will provide an economic opportunity for patients and us to participate in advancing the understanding and treatment of disease we believe that our ongoing investment in building our infrastructure and attracting talent across a range of disciplines to generate interpret and manage genetic information will position us to be a leader in the field of genetic testing and genome management we believe that genes are a fundamental particle of modern medicine and that genetic testing has the potential to affect billions of people virtually everyone is carrying loss of function mutations in their genome recessive genetic conditions that may affect their extended family or genetic mutations that may affect their response to various drugs or therapies every individual has a unique genome and we believe that comprehensive knowledge of this genetic makeup will be foundational to the future practice of medicine we also believe that eventually many individuals in a modern healthcare system will have their genome sequenced at birth or during the course of their lives according to unitedhealth group inc the us genetic testing and molecular diagnostics market in  was estimated to be approximately  billion of which approximately  was genetic testing as of december  genetestsorg estimated that there were more than  different genetic tests available from over  laboratories based on unitedhealths estimates for the growth of the genetic testing and molecular diagnostics market and our assumption that genetic testings share of this market will be held constant at approximately  between  and  we expect the us genetic testing market to grow to at least  billion by  we are headquartered in san francisco california where we have offices and a clinical laboratory improvement amendments or clia certified facility we also have offices in palo alto california as well as a second laboratory in santiago chile we have a multidisciplinary team of  people as of december   including bioinformaticians clinical and medical geneticists commercial and managed care experts genetic counselors scientists software engineers web developers graphic designers and lab automation specialists as well as administrative and corporate personnel we believe that creating a strong team is a competitive advantage and we strive to foster a motivating and unique culture in which our people can thrive in the near term we plan to focus on the immediate market for symptomatic disease with the goal to aggregate testing for large numbers of genetic diseases into a single lowcost service in the future we plan on expanding our efforts in carrier and newborn testing markets and later into the health and wellness market as our market share grows we expect that our business will develop in three stages over the longer term  genetic testing making genetic testing more affordable and more accessible with faster turnaround time than ever before we believe that there is a significant market opportunity for high volume low cost genetic testing that can allow us to serve a large number of clients  genome management building a secure and trusted genome management infrastructure by generating and storing large amounts of individualized genetic information for every patient sample we believe we can create value over the course of disease or lifetime of a client  genome network sharing genetic information on a global scale to advance science and medicine we plan to help patients share their genetic information in a way that benefits them and us by acting as a permission based broker on their behalf  we were
