for joining us today i’m tom arnoy cofounder and ceo of zedge welcome to zedge’s third quarter  earnings conference call recapping three months ended april   joining me today is jonathan reich our chief financial and chief operating officer who will provide insight into the numbers that we reported earlier today june st marked our first anniversary as an independent public company during our initial conference call i committed to you our investors that i would be forthright about the business and express our expectations and challenges this afternoon i’d like to share some trends facing our business and discuss what we are doing about them from a macro perspective on a year over year basis both our revenues and monthly active user base or mau have remained fairly flat peeling back the onion we’ve experienced solid mau growth in emerging markets while contracting in well developed economies at the same time our average revenue per monthly active user from apps or arpmau has improved across both welldeveloped economies and emerging markets this growth is impressive considering that we’ve been able to expand the revenue per user even when facing a decline in users in more valuable geographies furthermore considering our competitive position in the personalization space we believe that we are wellpositioned for continued growth i should also add that android users account for the bulk of these results as we continue to recover on ios after apple removed us from the itunes app store in early  we have taken stock of these trends and have narrowed our focus to concentrate on projects that will put mau back on a growth trajectory in the most valuable markets so that we can monetize more effectively if we can deliver on this strategy we expect to yield impressive revenue growth due to the expanding arpmau trends we have experienced in these markets in addition we have streamlined operations in order to accelerate these developments and release to market priority projects designed to achieve our goals our team is concentrating on improving core functionality and user experience which will positively impact user growth engagement and retention i’d like to highlight some of these investments to start we are reworking search which currently generates close to  million queries monthly the makeover provides more relevant results with an improved user interface that renders the constant in an engaging way recently we launched a whole new way for users to discover content by offering inspirational text mix ph together by color categories and trending searches we have also taken advantage of artificial intelligence to offer real time recommendations that are both timely and contextually relevant these recommendations are based on meaningful signals including personal interests preferences events and occasions we have already started to see positive impact from some of these investments and hope these will increase over the coming months many of these projects sound elementary which is precisely the point we need to focus on the core value proposition and functionality to make sure that our products align with the expectations of our users when we do users will return more often and engage more deeply it’s a virtuous cycle and we are committed to doing a better job of taking advantage of it as discussed last quarter our strategic focus on content is critical to enhancing user acquisition engagement and retention leading to an increase in revenues to this end i am pleased to announce that we rolled out an open beta of our entirely new content publishing platform earlier today it goes without saying that content creators are the fuel that drives our leadership position they are the strongest and most effective evangelists of our platform and contents in all candor we need to do better job of embracing this community to make them feel welcome and appreciate it a core means to achieve this is to overhaul our content upload tool and content management system which was only available from the desktop with the introduction of our new publishing platform creators will now be able to easily upload their art directly from their mobile devices and will be able to upload from their desktops far more easily this will result in a more welcoming and friendly experience open a door for new contributors improve loyalty among the creator community and aware our consumers of great and timely contents it will also have a positive effect on user growth because contributors market their creations to their friends and followers the flip side of where to focus is the deprioritizing of projects that have value but only with expanding mau we have temporarily reallocated some of the resources dedicated to developing collections which we previously referred to our stories yes we continue investing in growing our portfolio of hollywood releases and we are successful in expanding our marketing relationships to both the us and europe this past quarter we are still excited by the opportunity for collections and remain confident that it will generate revenue in calendar year  let me move on to ios it’s been around a year since we reentered the itune store with a wallpaper only app in late  we rolled out a free ringtones app and in late april of this year we launched our premium ringtones and marimba remixes featuring chart toping remixes from artists the app enables users to purchase and set these ringtones directly from within the app although this steps haven’t returned our user base and revenues to pre levels we remain committed to the apple existence ph early indications related to the premium ringtone app leave us with two priorities first scale the user base organically second grow the content catalog we are doing both of these and expect to share more details with you the next quarter shifting to zedge wallpapers we launched several powerful app updates that have had an exceptional impact on our rating our current version has a star rating compared to  stars previously this should benefit us in organic user acquisition as users will be more likely to install our app when seeing the positive reviews that should increase rankings in the app store giving us more visibility with potential customers with continued focus and improvements we believe that we can continue to unlock significant value with our ios offerings in wrapping up i want to stress my conviction that we can resume a growth trajectory in mau and revenue by continuing to focus on excellence in product content and user experience now i am going to turn the call over to jonathan reich for a discussion of the quarter’s financial results thank you jonathan reich thank you tom my remarks today will focus on our key operational and financial results for the third quarter of our fiscal year  for a comprehensive and detailed discussion of our results please read our earnings release issued earlier today and our form q which we expect to file with the sec by june   following my comments we will open the call to any questions you may have throughout my remarks the third quarter refers to february through april  and the second quarter refers to november  through january  monthly active users or mau that is the number of unique users that opened our app during the last  days of the quarter increased by  to  million during april  from  million in the corresponding period a yearago on a sequential basis mau was impacted by seasonality and as expected declined  the yearoveryear mau increase reflects strong growth in emerging markets partially offset by an  decline in users from welldeveloped countries as tom mentioned we do not downplay the import of this trend and are highly focused on streamlining operations and executing our projects that we expect will drive user growth in the highvalue geographies in order to increase our revenues total revenue in the third quarter declined  compared to the yearago quarter and  from the prior year quarter to  million the yearoveryear revenue decline was due to a combination of factors including but not limited to the removal of our app from the itunes stores in early  reduced investments in the game channel where we monetized on a cost per install basis decline in revenues from our desktop and mobile websites which became less relevant with the adoption of our smartphone apps and a drop in revenue from managing and optimizing a thirdparty’s advertising inventory however i want to point out that revenue generated from our android app increased by close to  yearoveryear and was basically flat sequentially we are proud of this especially considering seasonal advertising trends typically resulting in lighter budgets in the january through march period and the impact that the decrease in mau from welldeveloped markets had on the apps revenue contribution revenue derived from our android app constituted over  of zedge’s aggregate revenue in the third quarter overall average revenue per monthly active user generated from our apps or arpmau increased by close to  yearoveryear and  sequentially to  the yearoveryear and sequential increases in arpmau were primarily achieved through the introduction of a new higher value android ad unit in march  and the addition of direct advertising partners our direct cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased to  from  in the third quarter of fiscal  and was unchanged compared to the prior sequential quarter the yearoveryear increase reflects investment to reduce content delivery latency improved content filtering and expand our addressable user base for push notifications and inapp messages we believe that these investments are necessary to retain users and will lead to increased revenue in the future sga in the third quarter was  million a  increase compared to the year ago quarter and a  decrease compared to the prior quarter the yearoveryear increase primarily relates to increasing headcount to  from  and the costs associated with operating as a public company although we increased headcount by nine people in past year we don’t anticipate adding as many employees in the near to midterm it’s also important to note that the new hires are both driving the accelerated development of the projects that tom highlighted in his comments and closing technology deficits in core areas with new enhancements and features like our mobile publishing platform that was rolled out in open beta earlier day our loss from operations in the third quarter narrowed to  compared to a loss of  in the second quarter in the year ago quarter we achieved income from operations  our loss per share narrowed to  from  in the second quarter in the year ago quarter we reported earnings per diluted share of  zedge’s balance sheet continues to be strong and liquid at april th we reported  million in cash and cash equivalents compared to  million a year earlier our working capital or current assets less current liabilities was  million compared to  million at april   zedge has no debt to wrap up we are pleased by the yearoveryear increase in arpmau and are highly focused on efforts that will improve engagement and retention as tom discussed we’ve implemented a comprehensive program intended to accelerate mau and revenue growth by enhancing the quality discoverability and relevancy of the contents we make available to our users particularly those users in welldeveloped regions that command higher ad rates that concludes my remarks now tom and i will be happy to take your questions operator back to you for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you sir we will begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question of today is going to be john rolfe with argand capital please go ahead you’re your question john rolfe you provided some color on the year to year increase in sga as a function of the increased headcount can you just talk a little bit about the sequential decline in sg was that related to some of this refocusing of resources or what sort of was behind the decline quarter to quarter jonathan reich sure john thanks for asking the question this is jonathan and that relates to initiatives such as content creation where we began hearing back but overall that is related to making sure that we’re hyper focused on the things that will move the lever in terms of growing monthly active users john rolfe okay great and i did notice i mean you guys have sort of spoken a couple of times on the call about the need or the desire or the initiatives to get that monthly average users growing again so on the one hand you’ve kind of acknowledged that on the other hand you said i believe that the sequential decline was expected given seasonal factors and it does look like you had a similar decline in the year ago quarter on a sequential basis how should we be thinking about the trajectory of that mau seasonally from quarter to quarter and were you guys disappointed with the decline or was it expected jonathan reich so just to provide a little bit more color overall we did see that sequential decline but when you begin to take a look under the hood as we’d indicated the welldeveloped market that command higher ad rates were the ones where we saw decline and on the flip side emerging markets we actually saw the user base continue to grow and i guess when we think about this on an ongoing basis we do feel that the first quarter of the calendar year will typically be one where we see a fallback on user growth the fourth quarter of the calendar year will actually be one where we see that user growth improve and that is the seasonal effect having nothing to do with  or having little to do per se with the activities in which we’re investing to overall drive growth in the welldeveloped economies john rolfe i mean what is it i understand the seasonality in terms of the average revenue and the fact that there is more robust ad budgets over the holiday quarter at the end of the calendar year but what is the seasonal impact that’s driving better growth in the calendar fourth quarter and then the drop off of in the calendar first quarter jonathan reich sure so there are several factors but one very obvious factor in holiday present giving people get a new phone they’ll download an app they’ll try it out they’ll say hey great and then with time they will say you know what this isn’t really what i was looking for and that begins to tail off in the calendar first quarter operator operator instructions and it looks like our next questioner today is going to be andrew walker with rangeley capital please go ahead with your question andrew walker hey guys sorry if i missed it i got disconnected for a second but you launched a premium iphone app at the end of the quarter can you give us a little color on how that kind of launch works in the quarter and what you’re seeing there heading into this month tom arnoy hi andrew this is tom are you referring to the last release the premium ringtone apps the remixes app andrew walker yes that’s exactly what i’m talking about tom arnoy okay so we have launched app so if you go and look at the approximately it’s an app we are really proud of it looks really good it’s in our opinion state of the art we can still add more content to it like it has somewhat limited content still but we’re working on that however the content is of great quality a lot of remixed songs of famous artists and like really well known songs there for us now it’s all about scaling number of users and of course increasing the monetization per user or the  but this is a process that takes time we’re not going to spend material amounts of money on user acquisition where we really invest in getting organic growth in this app and that is going to take some time but we had like a really good start and does that answer your question andrew walker kind of i guess two questions on it so on the content right now it’s all marimba remixes why don’t you kind of get normal songs and normal sounds on there and the second question with you know how much revenue is kind of generating at this point tom arnoy so the last question first we don’t want to provide that number yet it’s still early regarding the first question yes people want all sorts of different content and we are exploring that too we chose now to go down a themed path with marimba remixes there’s a lot of demand for that content now this has to do with how we position the app how you communicate the value proposition how you also catch like keywords et cetera like in the app store we have many reasons why we chose this path but of course we will there are many possible paths from here and it’s a learning it’s a journey for us and currently if we succeed with this then we can go down many other  we can launch many different themes jonathan reich andrew just to set expectations this is not  this is still very early phase and revenue contribution is de minimis at this point as tom has said in quarter four revenues increase we’ve got to bring in users then convert by making a purchase and selling it so forth andrew walker okay i would just say having indiscernible i mean the obvious thing to get this more popular is adding more content but if you think the marimba remixes are popular i guess that’s one thing just kind of moving on i think you guys get a lot of consumer data i think you mentioned  was it over  million searches per month have you explored any ways to modify that outside of advertising for the users to kind of selling that data jonathan reich yes we have explored ways in which we can monetize that and as you can well appreciate we need to be very very careful there in order to make sure that we do not do something that will hurt our user base we have seen a lot of activity in the data space overall but there are whole host of purchases out there some of them are very outstanding and some of them are little bit more sketchy and we are beginning to generate a small amount of revenue from data but on a nonpii basis making sure that we are limiting it until we have a comfort level that we can really scale that without ultimately hurting our core business we don’t want to have a situation where we have a quick win with some data and users then begin to push back saying hey what are doing with my data and again just to reiterate anything that we do in the data space is on a very anonymized basis so that we do not embrace that relationship that we have with users in terms of securing and maintaining their privacy andrew walker and then just the last thing i would say i think three quarter ago the focus was on the set my ringtone app two quarters ago the focus was on the stories app now we are starting to hear stories on the indiscernible and they are going back to kind of elementary type things and all that sounds nice but this is a  year old company and as an investor it’s pretty concerning to hear these constant shifts i would just say  i don’t know what i am saying but it’s just very concerning to see revenue flat line and the constant shifts in narrative it will be nice to see the company just focus on the core app monetization and i guess elementary focus you guys mentioned tom arnoy i understand your comments but we are a tech company and we  like things change all the time we have to focus on the information and data we have at any given time and remember i believe we addressed this the last time as well but set my ring tone was one feature we highlighted that we chose not to pursue because it is  it takes a lot of investment to get where we believe we need to be with that feature in order to succeed so we haven’t dropped it we haven’t said we are not doing that but it’s there like maybe we will do it when it comes to collections or stories collections we are still investing in that and previously we didn’t invest like a big percent of the resources in that product we just wanted to address we are focusing back on like on a lot of the core stuffs and we are now stopping some development on collections and pursue  start to get more deals in at this point but we are not stopping doing it we’re just reducing the investment there the activity a little bit but i think it’s truly  it’s natural for a company like zedge from quartertoquarter move around resources because every day we get new data new information that can have the influence on our decisions and i would be surprised if these tests doesn’t happen in other tech companies andrew walker i don’t disagree with you i’m not saying don’t do it which makes the most sense but i’m just saying for a company every quarter to kind of shifting growth priorities and see this stalled out revenue growth at this level stalled out maus at this level it’s pretty concerning as an investor but it might be a conversation better taken offline so i will take it there so thanks for taking the question jonathan reich andrew it’s jonathan i think if i were to do reframe this i think that where we have not done as good of a job as we can do is actually in highlighting that our core app has and continues to be the investment which  the asset i should say where we invest the most time in resources in the previous conference calls and maybe we are guilty of not articulating that well and maybe we’re also guilty of trying to share a vision of where we think this can go but i think that i would reframe your description to want to  you don’t rightfully want to see that every quarter hey we have a new top priority and i agree with that i think that in our previous conference calls we have talked about features where we have tested and explored but it’s not like we’ve taken  of the workforce and allocated them on something or invested their resources on something which has not won the favor that our users would like rather we have a limited amount of resources that are dedicated to trying new things out so that we can continue to evolve and what we really have decided this quarter is as opposed to continuing to evolve collections with technical and development resources we rather apply those technical and development resources for the most part to some of the core areas which we would like to accelerate a little bit more quickly but on the sales and marketing side we are full steam ahead in terms of bringing in more partners making sure that we are expanding our footprint in previous quarters we were only available pretty much in canada with the studios this past quarter we have actually launched collections both in the us and in europe and that continues to be their goal and objective ultimately to translate into a revenue producing contributor to our business but i think that in summary we have not done as good of a job in terms of articulating the focus that we have on the core app and we need to do a better job of that going forward operator and our next questioner today is going to be brian warner with performance capital please go ahead with your question brian warner hi guys couple of questions on your efforts to improve and grow your arpmau you sort of mentioned a couple of things and i’m wondering if you could just sort to talk in late terms about which of those things can sort of move the lever the most and if we’re trying to observe and watch and grade you when should we begin to see the fruits of those things and maybe you can marry it to what it might look like a few years out in terms of your vision i know it’s a little vague but i’ll leave it there tom arnoy hi this is tom first of all i think we are already seeing the fruits of this as we mentioned just now we have added new ads formats and have different  and we are constantly testing new things there again the most important for us is focusing on making sure that we continue growth in user base because that is the strongest driver on revenue so we’re balancing how much business is we’re investing and try new advertising formats however we are constantly trying new things and we are now exploring some really interesting things i think we expect to see results every quarter and then that’s really what the whole family has to work for but generally it is formats shortterm more longterm we have addressed that we are working on collections hopefully that will bring like a new revenue stream and for sure also ios it’s still early but we really hope that ios will be a strong contributor to our revenue and to our average revenue per user moving forward operator operator

to mr arnoy please go ahead sir tom arnoy thank you operator and thank you all for joining us today i am tom arnoy cofounder and ceo of zedge welcome to zedge’s first quarter of fiscal  earnings conference call recapping the three months ended october   joining me today is jonathan reich our chief financial and chief operating officer we’re pleased to share the highlights of the quarter as you know from our previous calls zedge is focused on growing our user base increasing engagement and ultimately expanding our revenues through that user growth and new methods to monetize our base we know there is great untapped potential in our platform that we can unlock by investing in these priorities after a decline last quarter we made good progress in q most notably with the uptick in monthly active users or mau and we are seeing improving trends in engagement i want to quickly note that we are no longer reporting active installs as google has ceased reporting total device active installs for zedge mau is a significant performance indicator because it speaks to both reach and retention we’re pleased about the recent improvement in mau and are optimistic that we can build on that success during the last  days of the first quarter mau grew by  to  million when compared to the last  days of q of fiscal  we also saw modest growth in mau compared to q of the prior fiscal year mau resumed growing this past quarter which is important considering that q  was the first quarter in our history which witnessed a decline in mau this growth is a direct result of our investments in improving the user experience which should provide a sustained user growth and ultimately translate into revenue expansion that said in q average revenue per monthly active user declined by  we are working hard to reverse this downturn by continuing to grow our user base with users that generate greater revenues and unlocking the potential with improved engagement and introducing new monetization layers as stated earlier user growth engagement and retention are harbingers of revenue growth in q we took assertive steps to advance zedge’s reach and revenue potential to that end i want to outline three areas of focus that we have adopted scaling our team optimizing the user experience and expanding our product portfolio i would like to elaborate on the progress we’ve made in each of these areas first the team we have made significant investments in expanding our team both in norway and in the us in fact compared to the yearago quarter our team has grown by eight people key hires in q were related directly to driving zedge’s revenue potential namely hiring in products engineering marketing and commercial partnerships our engineering and development team growth contributed directly to an unprecedented level of updates and new product growth we also expanded our commercial team by bringing on seasoned professionals focusing on the sports and entertainment verticals they are already hard at work establishing partnerships with major content providers as zedge takes action on its stated commitment to open up the homescreen to brands that want to engage with their fans and customers with compelling personalization content second is our focus on optimizing the user experience and improving engagement our quarterly results show that our efforts are resonating in these areas as we selectively deployed feature enhancements to accelerate user growth and increase customer engagement an improved user experience is especially critical as we approach the holiday period not to mention for overall retention examples of feature enhancements made in the first quarter includes using ai technology to scale images from low resolution to high resolution thus making more content available just in time for those turning to zedge in order to personalize their new highend phones this holiday season this effort resulted in a significant increase of wallpapers available to  of us users and  of global users for users affected this has led to  more interaction with the content and  more wallpapers being set through deep learning and enhanced technology we have improved the user experience by ensuring that our content is easy to discover and fun to navigate this update has unearthed  more unique content we will continue to leverage this powerful functionality to improve content recommendations and search results we have enabled the possibility to set lock screen wallpapers directly from within the app for more than  of our user base which for this group has increased the number of users setting wallpapers by  in the coming months we expect to enable this functionality to more and more users we have significantly reduced the latency for users playing ringtones and notifications to ensure a much more responsive experience after these improvements on average our users are listening to  more ringtones and notifications than before finally we remain committed to expanding our product portfolio with the goal of increasing our reach we have rolled out an unprecedented number of products over the past several months we most recently launched ringtones for ios as well as expanded the beta of our new app snakk globally even as we expect to continue to optimize these products we view these launches as significant accomplishments which will help us in growing our user base beyond this our data reveals that overall retention has improved with the android widgets beta we’re also focused on finalizing set my ringtone in calendar  which we believe will have broad appeal and help expand our user base in another exciting development we made steady progress with the introduction of zedge stories both in terms of the core product offering and brand partners to this end we started promoting content from mmas world series of fighting our first foray into sports and expect to offer embedded merchandising capabilities in stories in time for the holidays the content is related to world series of fightings new years eve megaevent at new yorks madison square garden to be broadcast live on the nbc television network we remain committed to growing our user base and designing and deploying products that cement our leadership position in smartphone personalization we believe that over time this will create a sustainable path to revenue growth now i am going to turn the call over to jonathan reich for a discussion of the quarter’s financial results thank you jonathan reich thank you tom my comments today will focus on our key operational and financial results for q of fiscal  the three months ended october st  for a comprehensive and detailed discussion of our results please read our earnings release issued earlier today and our form q which we expect to file with the sec by december th following my comments we will open the call and address any questions you may have in my remarks and unless i specify otherwise comparisons are to the year ago quarter mainly the first quarter of fiscal year  monthly active users or mau climbed to  million during the last  days of the first quarter from  million in the comparable period one year ago and  million in the sequential quarter as tom mentioned this growth primarily relates to improving the user experience increasing engagement and relaunching the ios ringtone app revenue in the first quarter was  million a decrease of  compared to the first quarter of fiscal year  while average revenue per monthly active user or arpmau decreased  year over year to  cents the yearoveryear declines in revenue and arpmau reflect the impact of apple’s decision to remove the zedge app from itunes in early  and our decision in april  to deemphasize the game channel which resulted in a decline in game installs mau is a leading directional indicator of revenue and we expect that the investments we are making in our offerings will help expand our reach and drive continued growth in mau taken together with the improvements in user engagement we believe that these efforts will translate into both expanding revenues and new monetization opportunities that will start to unfold later this year direct cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to  from  in q  and from  in q  as we experienced higher marketing automation expense related to reaching a larger number of our customers and increases in both hosting and content filtering costs we will seek to manage these costs and ensure that we have the right partners and infrastructure to support our user growth sga grew by  or  to  million compared to the year ago quarter the increase primarily reflects growing our headcount to  from  in the year ago quarter and the added costs of operating as a public company following our spinoff from idt in june the impact of these factors was partially offset in the first quarter by several nonroutine items including a tax credit in norway and lower bonus payouts looking ahead we expect that sga will continue to increase in  as we further expand the team and increase our investment in new technology and content development the revenue decline in combination with the increase in sga expense lowered income from operations to  from  in the year ago quarter net income per diluted share decreased to  compared to  in the first quarter of fiscal  despite a  foreign exchange gain compared to a foreign exchange loss of  a year earlier turning to our balance sheet zedge remains well capitalized as of october st we reported  million in cash and cash equivalents compared to  million a year earlier trade accounts receivable were  million and our historical receivables collection rate is  zedge continues to carry no debt although we have access to a  million credit facility with bridge bank to wrap up my remarks our efforts to improve mau expand reach and improve engagement are starting to pay dividends as evidenced by the reversal in the direction of mau from last quarter we believe that these initiatives will result in expanding revenue in  both organically and through the introduction of new monetization schemes we will continue to invest judiciously in growth opportunities pursuant to the strategy tom outlined in his remarks and do so while maintaining a healthy balance sheet with ample liquidity this concludes my remarks now tom and i will be happy to take your questions operator back to you for qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first questioner today is john rolfe ph with oregon capital please go ahead unidentified analyst hey guys so just a little help i guess with the numbers can you give us any sort of guidance with respect to on either a percentage of revenue basis or on an absolute basis how we should be thinking about sga for the entire year and i guess i sort of asked the question in the context of your comment that there were some puts and takes this quarter so im just trying to understand what a certain normalized level for sga might be for the year now that you have certain ongoing run rate with all the public company expenses jonathan reich yes so this is jonathan and thanks for asking the question what weve said in the past really is two things first of all the cost of being a public company we estimated it to be somewhere between  to  compared to when we were majority owned by idt and the growth in sga that we see aside from that really relates to adding more personnel which as we mentioned we grew around  people from a year ago this quarter we’re not really at the point where we are providing projections but suffice it to say that if were  people now we believe that we will be north of  people by the end of the fiscal year if not more than that and i should add as well that we have had a pretty consistent policy within the company that we are not going to just load up the ship with contents on the people unless we know that or unless we feel very comfortable that the revenue will be there to ultimately support that investment unidentified analyst okay thats helpful thank you and let me just ask i guess one additional question i mean looking longer term can you guys talk at all about sort of what you think a target operating model for the business might be i mean when you look at a business like yours what  once you sort of transition through the growth investments what sort of operating margins do you think should be achievable for a business like yours jonathan reich yes so it’s also a little bit early for us to answer that question because as weve described we have several initiatives in terms of the monetization stack that we need to really scale out in a marketplace as i think john you know that our revenue today is primarily driven by programmatic advertising and the new monetization schemes that we have been working on we believe will sell at a premium to those but its still a little bit too early for us to really be able to sort of say hey it will be a    whatever that number is so we ask that you indulge with us while we are sort of getting those products out there and assessing what demand will be like and where those products price out that being said when thinking about the addons that weve had on the commercial side focusing on the sports and the entertainment verticals these are verticals which are investing tons and tons of money in terms of their marketing initiatives and thinking about the fact that zedge really can bring ownership of the homescreen whether it be through wallpapers lock screen wallpapers widgets icons and all of the associated audio to these different verticals we are very excited about what the opportunity is and look forward to executing on that in the upcoming quarters operator our next questioner today is andrew walker with rangeley capital please go ahead sir andrew walker hey guys thanks for taking the question yes so i just wanted to start with so for the overall revenue declines obviously arpu was way down and you guys kind of mentioned games as a driver but i was wondering if you could draw a little bit further down and kind of switch  and kind of break it down like how much was games a driver versus i think the other piece has to be either a lot lower prices on advertising or a lot less engagement from users so can you kind of break those three different pieces down jonathan reich hey andrew how are you yeah it’s jonathan so a couple of things what weve said was really that there were two pieces here a not being around an ios obviously had hurt us and that prevented us from pushing upgrades to the existing customers so that was basically something that contributed to the downturn and when comparing the two platforms ios does monetize at a higher rate than indiscernible number one number two is the game channel specifically we experienced a downturn there because weve not been investing there and that was a we’ve not broken out the numbers in the past but its fair to assume that that was definitely something that was helping us in terms of lifting the average revenue per monthly active user we overall have seen that on android that were holding our own in terms of where that has been pricing out so these ancillary and important but ancillary removals from ios and from the game channel we think are the overall piece that has hurt us there in terms of engagement tom do you want to address that a little bit tom arnoy yeah sure so mike we have not seen like a decline on engagement on the retention in general there are no clear patents on the crease they’re like in fact like our focus on engagement and retention we think over time will have a significant impact on the average revenue per user and we speak more to both factors as like session time and frequency of use as like how many times a user actually uses zedge in a month et cetera that has very big impact on the average revenue per user and that is one of our main focus areas right now and expands everything from focusing on content discovery and like search recommendations and ui and algorithms a whole lot of things andrew walker okay that was super helpful and then i guess you’ve mentioned the iphone a couple of times and we didn’t get to talk about it last quarter but if we just looked at monthly active users on android versus iphone would it be substantially higher than the  that youre reporting right now on android because im guessing iphones drives it down jonathan reich are you talking about growth on android versus growth on ios andrew walker yeah monthly active users on android instead of like you guys report overall but if i was looking just at android would it be much higher so iphone is dragging the overall number down jonathan reich yes i dont have the numbers in front of me but let me get back to you on that andrew walker okay i can follow up with you guys on that and then just kind of turning to zedge stories so i’m just on my iphone looking at zedge stories and the top two right now are kind of bad santa and the washington wizards are you guys getting paid for these or are these still kind of aimed i guess freebie mode jonathan reich yes so were not as of yet charging for stories and let me sort of share with you what we envision in terms of progression we need to iterate until we get the product right and we also need to have a couple of successes and wins that we can use to market but we believe that in calendar year  we will begin to monetize those stories directly with content owners there looking to gain access to our customer base andrew walker perfect okay well that was super helpful and i will follow up kind of offline with you guys on everything else operator operator instructions our next questioner is dylan adelman from global platinum securities please go ahead dylan adelman hi so i have a question about the alignment of management and shareholder interests so because zedge is a smaller fast growing company thats based around the mobile application it does seem very much like a startup company and startups usually compensate upper management and regular employees as well using options and this is to align those interests of management with shareholders as well as prevent cash burn but looking to the proxy you noticed that both of you mr reich and mr arnoy you both received about   in total compensation and none of that was in stock owned options this is about oneseventh of the total sga of the firm and more than the firms net income for the year so in recognizing that options are really critical for smaller fast run companies like zedge theyre critical for aligning that management shareholder interest can you talk a little bit more about how you think about this compensation structure and choosing to pay a large salary and bonus in cash rather than focusing mostly on options jonathan reich so first of all dylan i think that there was mention of a new options package being offered to management and the compensation youre looking at is for the previous year the ownership of the company it felt that in light of our having grown the company to the point where it was selfsustaining and would unlock value for shareholders that it was the right thing to throw some additional cash our way but certainly we have we had at the point of the spinout our equity piece had been fully vested and there is an additional equity grant that is part of compensation now in terms of our cash compensation we have a bonus on top of or the potential for a bonus i should say on top of our base compensation and if we dont meet our numbers in fiscal year  we will not be able to take benefit of that cash bonus accordingly dylan adelman okay so just like one followup question on that are you looking at shifting your compensation more towards stock or options in the future and the reason why i just press on this so much is because to me zedge does seem like a great company but theres always those concerns with smaller companies if management is not really if they dont have skin in the game as i can phrase it that way and for me thats just one persistent concern that i dont see that same skin in the game that you might hope for in a smaller company so do you see that compensation shifting at all jonathan reich yeah thats really not a question that and i dont want to sound that im not sensitive to your question but ultimately our compensation is determined by the board and by the comp committee and i would venture to say that we both have skin in the game and that our employees overall have skin in the game in terms of overall option grants and hard equity that is owned by that group so ill be glad to followup with you if you like but i dont have that much more to say on this at this point in time operator operator
