launching marketing in the asiapacific region through an online advertising campaign leveraging our experience and utilizing our business contacts in the asiapacific region   industry competition and future operations the it web system integration and application solutions industry   the it web systems integration and applications solutions market is a highly fragmented industry there are numerous companies that have established businesses and command large market share such as accenture bae systems cognizant technology fujitsu hewlettpackard ibm infosys lockheed martin oracle tata consultancy that we compete against we also compete with alibaba ebay amazon rakuten groupon asos expedia and other ecommerce platform companies specifically in our ecommerce business in the asiapacific region additionally many of the vendor companies that the industry purchases products from may compete against their clients by offering full life cycle solutions and packages that support compatible software and hardware products a role that it web and system integrators normally play therefore emerging companies in our industry have taken to a full solution approach that offers clients a robust best of breed and customized software programming with a higher emphasis on customer service relations additionally in the asiapacific markets companies offer other options such as managing payroll and accounting as well as recruitment and human resources on behalf of clients to further differentiate themselves from competitors according to transparency market research in  the firm believes that the global market for system integration services was valued at  billion in  and is expected to reach  billion by  growing at a cagr compound annual growth rate of  during the period their assessment of the industry was that the asia pacific region was expected to be the fastest growing regional market for system integration during the forecasted period the rapidly growing economies of the asiapacific region and globalization of firms are key drivers in propelling demand for the it system integration and services business   our company has developed a strategy that will encompass a broader approach to traditional it web and system integration by focusing efforts on the emerging mobile payment industry our approach is to offer our clients full mobile payment integration with their it strategy and developing a competitive mobile solution to their commerce needs according to mckinsey a global business consultancy firm the asiapacific region will account for more than  of the global payments growth over the next five years and cashless transactions will increase by more than  growth in countries such as thailand vietnam indonesia and china   competition   the mobile payments industry in the asiapacific region is highly competitive given the outlook in the asiapacific region we believe that competition for revenues will intensify in the mobile payments space we compete with standalone players such as paypal netteller china union pay alipay and bitpay additionally we compete with three categories of institutional players nonbank payment companies asiapacific banks in home markets and banks in nonhome markets        nonbank payment companies are telecom or telco companies that are seeking to expand their existing technologies by offering mobile payment solutions integrated into mobile phones and consumer machines such as ticketing services asiapacific banks are banks in home markets in asia such as hsbc citi and standard chartered these banking institutions seek to increase their footprint with clients by offering mobile bank payment solutions in order to capture more revenue banks in nonhome markets are banks outside the asiapacific region that offer competitive services with the objective to increase cash management services through either low cost fees or no fee accounts these banks are generally the least sophisticated members of the current competitive landscape based upon their inexperience in operating within the asiapacific region however the amount of financial resources these banks control are formidable   employees   as of

over financial reporting      section a of the jobs act goes on to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirements in  act section ae for companies with a class of securities registered under the  act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes   other items of the jobs act  the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with

offered for resale by the selling stockholders is highly speculative in nature involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for persons who can afford to risk the loss of the entire amount invested  before purchasing any of these securities you should carefully consider the following factors relating to our business and prospects  if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment    risks related to our business and industry   other it solutions exist in the marketplace and thus the space is highly competitive   due to the growing savviness of it users in overall the business of it solutions services is highly competitive and ever demanding in terms of speed and comprehensiveness smaller companies and individual freelancer of it services provider have mushroomed within the region in the recent years to cater to every need of businesses however with the established of our presence in within the asian countries and team of experts it specialists we are able to compete in the market competitively our network of business contacts within the asian region have grown to allow us to tap on to them for potential new business        our failure to obtain capital may significantly restrict our proposed operations   we will need to raise capital to expand our business it is anticipated that we will require an additional capital raise of  million dollars over the next twentyfour months to fund our business plans future sources of capital may not be available to us when we need it or may be available only on unacceptable terms   we are subject to the risk that certain key personnel including key employees named below on whom we depend in part for our operations will cease to be involved with us  the loss of any these individuals would adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our operations   we are dependent on the experience knowledge skill and expertise of our chairman of the board chief executive officer and president eugene wong we are also in large part dependent on our director chief financial officer and secretary khoo mae ling and cornelius ee our vice president of it the loss of any of these key personnel could materially and adversely affect our future business efforts our success depends in substantial part upon the services efforts and abilities of mr wong due to his experience history and knowledge of the business of and services provided by the company the inability of the company to retain the services of mr wong or to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations  we do not currently carry keyman life insurance on mr wong or any of our officers and have no present plans to obtain this insurance      competition from other information technology related companies in the same space could result in a decrease our business and a decrease in our financial performance   we operate in the highly competitive industry many of our current and potential competitors including alibaba ebay amazon rakuten groupon asos expedia and other  have existed longer and have larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing personnel technical and other resources than the company in addition many of these competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to research and development of new products attracting and retaining key employees maintaining a large budget for marketing and promotional expenses and providing more favorable credit terms to suppliers and channel distributors   the relative lack of public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage   as a company with a class of securities registered under the exchange act we are subject to reporting and other legal accounting corporate governance and regulatory requirements imposed by the exchange act and rules and regulations promulgated under the exchange act  mr wong lacks public company experience which could impair our ability to comply with these legal accounting and regulatory requirements  such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis  our senior management may not be able to implement and effect programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal and regulatory compliance and reporting requirements our failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and further result in the deterioration of our business    regulations including those contained in and issued under the sarbanesoxley act of  “sox” and the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  “doddfrank” increase the cost of doing business and may make it difficult for us to retain or attract qualified officers and directors which could adversely affect the management of our business and our ability to obtain or retain listing of our common stock      the current regulatory climate for public companies even small and emerging growth companies such as ours may make it difficult or prohibitively expensive to attract and retain qualified officers directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management in compliance with the rules and regulations which govern publiclyheld companies including but not limited to certifications from executive officers and requirements for financial experts on boards of directors the perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles  for example the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in the issuance of a series of new rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the sec  further recent and proposed regulations under doddfrank heighten the requirements for board or committee membership particularly with respect to an individual’s independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications if we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors the management of our business could be adversely affected   the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management which could make it difficult to manage our business particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company”   we are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements including those required by the sec complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements are timeconsuming and expensive and could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and requirements of sox the cost of complying with these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition sox requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures we must commit significant resources may be required to hire additional staff and need to continue to provide effective management oversight we will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join the company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion these activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   as an “emerging growth company” we may take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of sox and rules and regulations of the sec thereunder which we refer to as section  and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements when these exemptions cease to apply we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years although we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — jobs act” for additional information on when we may cease to be deemed to be an emerging growth company we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs   our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business          we are subject to various sec reporting and other regulatory requirements we have incurred and will continue to incur expenses and to a lesser extent diversion of our management’s time in our efforts to comply with sox section  regarding internal controls over financial reporting  our management’s evaluation over our internal controls over financial reporting may determine that material weaknesses in our internal control exist  if in the future management identifies material weaknesses or our external auditors are unable to attest that our management’s report is fairly stated or to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls this could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports have an adverse effect on our stock price and subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities    limitations on director and officer liability and our indemnification of our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director     our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide with certain exceptions as permitted by delaware corporation law that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct fraud or knowing violation of law or unlawful payments of dividends these provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by governing state law      we may incur a variety of costs to engage in future acquisitions of companies products or technologies to grow our business to expand into new markets or to provide new services  as such the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions may never be realized   it is management’s intention to acquire other businesses to grow our customer base to expand into new markets and to provide new product lines  we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in complementary companies products or technologies although no additional material acquisitions or investments are currently pending  acquisitions may be accompanied by risks such as      · difficulties in assimilating the operations and employees of acquired companies     · diversion of our management’s attention from ongoing business concerns     · our potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and services     · additional expense associated with amortization of acquired assets     · additional expense associated with understanding and development of acquired business     · maintenance and implementation of uniform standards controls procedures and policies and     · impairment of existing relationships with employees suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new management employees        we must attract and retain skilled personnel  if we are unable to hire and retain technical sales and marketing and operational employees our business could be harmed   our revenues are generated by the sales of our information technology products and services from our direct sales and to a lesser extent our website  our ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent on our ability to develop and retain an effective sales force and qualified technical and managerial personnel we intend to hire additional employees including software developers sales and marketing employees and operational employees  the competition for developers and programmers qualified sales and managerial personnel in the information technology community is intense and we may not be able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel  in addition we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations control our costs maintain compliance with all applicable regulations and expand our internal management technical information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth which could have an adverse impact on our operations    our failure to manage growth effectively could harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel and adversely impact our operating results   there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expansion through acquisitions effectively our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth damage our reputation and negatively affect our financial performance and harm our business    if we obtain financing existing shareholder interests may be diluted   if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be diluted in addition any new securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock furthermore we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when and to the extent we require or that if available it will be on acceptable terms   a large percentage of our business come from international operations and may affect financial results in us dollar terms and could negatively impact our financial results   a large percentage of our revenues come from international operations between january   and june   our revenues generated from international operations were  which is  of total revenue we expect this trend to continue into the near future and have no system in place to combat currency risk      risks related to our common stock   our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly   once our shares begin trading the market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile in part because our shares have not been traded publicly in addition the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors most of which we cannot control including     · competition from other information technology companies or related businesses     · changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and in particular in the nuclear power industry     · changes in key personnel     · entry into new geographic markets     · actions and announcements by us or our competitors or significant acquisitions divestitures strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments     · changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other radiation detection and related companies         · investors’ perceptions of our prospects and the prospects of the nuclear power industry      · fluctuations in quarterly operating results as well as differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors     · the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties including our filings with the sec     · announcements relating to litigation     · financial guidance if any that we provide to the public any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance     · changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock     · the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock     · future sales of our common stock by our officers directors and significant stockholders and     · changes in accounting principles affecting our financial reporting        these and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance the stock markets and trading facilities including the otc bulletin board have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities in many companies in the past stockholders of some companies have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business   our common stock is subject to risks arising from restrictions on reliance on rule  by shell companies or former shell companies   under a regulation of the sec known as “rule ” a person who has beneficially owned restricted securities of an issuer and who is not an affiliate of that issuer may sell them without registration under the securities act provided that certain conditions have been met one of these conditions is that such person has held the restricted securities for a

position and other information constituting “form  information” under the sec’s regulations          because of the company’s history as a shell company stockholders who receive our restricted securities will be able to sell them pursuant to rule  without registration for only as long as we continue to meet those requirements and are not a shell company no assurance can be given that we will meet these requirements or that we will continue to do so or that we will not again be a shell company furthermore any nonregistered securities we sell in the future or issue for acquisitions or to consultants or employees in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose will have limited or no liquidity until and unless such securities are registered with the sec andor until a year after we have complied with the requirements of rule  as a result it may be harder for us to fund our operations to acquire assets and to pay our consultants with our securities instead of cash furthermore it will be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the sec which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future in addition if we are unable to attract additional capital it could have an adverse impact on our ability to implement our business plan and sustain our operations  our status as a former “shell company” could prevent us from raising additional funds engaging consultants and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions which could cause the value of our securities if any to decline in value or become worthless     future sales of our common stock or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur may depress our stock price   sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after this offering or the perception that these sales could occur could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares upon completion of this offering we will have  shares of common stock outstanding  our shares of common stock offered in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the securities act except for any shares of our common stock that may be subsequently held or acquired by our directors executive officers and other “affiliates” as that term is defined in the securities act which will be restricted securities under the securities act restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the securities act or an exemption from registration is available   in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you   if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline   the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business we do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts if no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted if we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceased coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline        our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation   as a public company we are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting under section  in addition at such time as we cease to be an “emerging growth company” as more fully described in these risk factors we will be required to comply with section  at such time we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of section  in addition if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended from time to time we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations if we are not able to implement the requirements of section  in a timely manner or with adequate compliance our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the sec as a result there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements in addition we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows    our management and other affiliates have significant control of our common stock and could control our actions in a manner that conflicts with the interests of other stockholders   after the offering we anticipate that our executive officers directors and their affiliated entities together will beneficially own the majority of our common stock representing the majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as a result these stockholders acting together will be able to exercise considerable influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and may not always act in the best interests of other stockholders such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices   we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future   the continued operation and growth of our business will require substantial cash accordingly we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations financial condition contractual restrictions relating to indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant accordingly if you purchase shares in this offering realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock   antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable   our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of us more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions among other things      · authorize the issuance of previously undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued at the discretion of our board of directors without stockholder approval and which may include supermajority voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock   · prohibit stockholder action by written consent which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders   · provide that only the chairperson of our board of directors chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors may call a special meeting of stockholders   · provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws   · provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office even though less than a quorum and   · establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings   these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a changeincontrol even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire   cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements   information included in this prospectus may constitute “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are based upon our current assumptions expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and

“believe” “approximately” “estimate” “predict” “project” “potential” “continue” “ongoing” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology although the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forwardlooking this information may involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results performance or achievements to be materially different from the future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forwardlooking statements   factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in “risk factors” contained in this prospectus as a result of these factors we cannot assure you that the forwardlooking statements in this prospectus will prove to be accurate except as required by law we expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements for any reason after the date of this prospectus to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations you should however review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the sec after the date of this prospectus        use of proceeds   the selling stockholders may sell all of the shares covered by this prospectus for their own accounts accordingly we will not receive any proceeds from the resale of the common stock    dividend policy   to date we have never declared dividends or paid cash dividends on our common stock in the future if we become profitable our board of directors may in its discretion declare a dividend on our common stock from our surplus earnings  there is no assurance that we will ever become profitable or that we will have surplus earnings from which a dividend can be paid  the declaration of dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon our earnings financial position general economic conditions and other pertinent factors   determination of offering price   the price of the shares offered by the selling stockholders is based ono a fixed pricing as a result of the selling shareholders being statutory underwriters we have no agreement written or oral with our selling stockholders about this price in this offering  the offering price may bear no relationship whatsoever to our assets earnings book value or other criteria of value the factors considered by a selling stockholder in setting the offer price for its shares might include   ·  the risk or unpredictable nature of our business ·  the price at which we have sold our stock in offerings not registered under the securities act ·  what the selling stockholders consider to be our growth potential ·  the price at which we issued our common stock to certain of the selling stockholders in exchange for debt and for services and ·  the price the selling stockholder believes a purchaser is willing to pay for our stock   prior to this offering there has been no market for our securities    market for common equity and related stockholder matters   market information   there is no established public trading market for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop or if developed may not be sustained a stockholder in all likelihood therefore will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she desire to do so when eligible for public resale furthermore it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans unless a regular trading market develops we have no plans proposals arrangements or understandings with any person with regard to the development of a trading market in any of our securities   penny stock considerations   our shares likely will be “penny stocks” as that term is generally defined in the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to mean equity securities with a price of less than  our shares thus will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock        under the penny stock regulations a brokerdealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited investor must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale generally an individual with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  individually or  together with his or her spouse is considered an accredited investor in addition under the penny stock regulations the brokerdealer is required to   ·  deliver prior to any transaction involving a penny stock a disclosure schedule prepared by the sec relating to the penny stock market unless the brokerdealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt   ·  disclose commissions payable to the brokerdealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities   ·  send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer’s account the account’s value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks and   ·  make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer’s account   because of these regulations brokerdealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock which may affect the ability of selling stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market these additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities if our securities become publicly traded in addition the liquidity for our securities may be decreased with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our stockholders will in all likelihood find it difficult to sell their securities   otc bulletin board qualification for quotation   to have our shares of common stock on the otc bulletin board a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock we intend on engaging spartan securities group ltd a finra market maker to file our application on form  with finra   holders   as of the date of this prospectus we have four holders of record of our common stock   dividends   we have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future any decisions as to future payments of dividends will depend on our earnings and financial position and such other facts as the board of directors deems relevant        management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   you should read the following discussion of our financial

to raise capital by offering shares of our common stock or convertible debt to investors  for the next twentyfour months we anticipate we will need approximately  in additional capital to fund our business plans if we do not raise the required capital we may not meet our expenses and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so and if we do we may find the cost of such financing to be burdensome on the company additionally we may not be able to execute on our business plans due to unforeseen market forces        results of operations for the three and six months ended june   and

public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenues and expenses amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements        income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  “income taxes” asc  requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  likely of being realized on examination for tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test no tax benefit is recorded the adoption had no effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements we believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements we suggest that our significant accounting policies as described in our financial statements in the summary of significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to     · have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act     · comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis     · submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and     · disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceo’s compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards        we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period   as an emerging growth company the company is exempt from section a and b of the securities exchange act of  which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes   the company is an emerging growth company under the jobs act of  but the company has irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section b of the jobs act    recent accounting pronouncements   in august  fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date” the amendments in asu  defer the effective date of asu  for all entities by one year public business entities certain notforprofit entities and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in asu  to annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   in november  the fasb issued asu  “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” which changes how deferred taxes are classified on the company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted asu  requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent upon adoption we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the company has no deferred tax assets and liabilities at march   and recorded a valuation allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at december     in february  the fasb issued asu  leases topic  which supersedes asc  leases  this asu is based on the principle that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases  the asu does not significantly change the lessees’ recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard  leases are classified as finance or operating  the asu’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating lease arrangements  lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less  lessors’ accounting under the asc is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard  in addition the asu expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements  lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach which includes a number of practical expedients  the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted  management continues to assess the overall impact the adoption of asu  will have on the company’s financial statements         in march  the fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net” the amendments in this asu are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance the effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic ” public entities should apply the amendments in asu  for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods therein the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu  “compensation  stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” the amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment award transactions are simplified including a income tax consequences b classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and c classification on the statement of cash flows the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   offbalance sheet arrangements   none

  authorized capital stock   the authorized capital stock of the company consists of  shares of common stock par value  per share hereinafter referred to in this section as the “common stock” of which there are  issued and outstanding and  shares of preferred stock hereinafter referred to in this section as the “preferred stock” par value  per share of which none have been designated or issued the following summarizes important information regarding our capital stock        common stock   holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends if any as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors in its discretion from funds legally available in the event of a liquidation dissolution or winding up of the company the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata all assets remaining after payment in full of all liabilities all of the outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable holders of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the company’s common stock there are no conversion or redemption rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock   preferred stock   the board of directors is authorized by our certificate of incorporation to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock in series and by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of delaware to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation powers preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the stockholders any shares of preferred stock so issued would have priority over the common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights any future issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock at present we have no plans to neither issue any preferred stock nor adopt any series preferences or other classification of preferred stock   the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock although the board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock the board of directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock unless otherwise required by law or stock exchange rules we have no present plans to issue any preferred stock   the description of certain matters relating to the securities of the company is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement on form  filed with the sec on july          dividends   we have not paid any dividends on our common stock and do not presently intend to pay cash dividends prior to the consummation of a business combination the payment of cash dividends in the future if any will be contingent upon our revenues and earnings if any capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to consummation of a business combination if any the payment of any dividends subsequent to a business combination if any will be within the discretion of our then existing board of directors it is the present intention of our board of directors to retain all earnings if any for use in our business operations and accordingly the board of directors does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future    preemptive rights   holders of common stock are not entitled to preemptive or subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable

should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the company’s most recent annual financial statements filed with the sec on form k for fiscal year

presented have been reflected herein the results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period as reported in the form k have been omitted   use of estimates  – the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities these estimates and judgments are based on historical information information that is currently available to the company and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents  – the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are primarily in money market funds the carrying value of those investments approximates fair value   accounts receivable – accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are stated at the amount the company expects to collect from outstanding balances the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible management considers accounts receivable to be fully collectible at june     f    revenue recognition – the company derives its revenues primarily from providing web and it services web and it services revenues consist of fees from web design software development domain and hosting and maintenance and other services the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists services have been rendered the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured the companys service arrangements are generally noncancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event of cancellations the company records revenues net of sales taxes revenues from web design software development are generally recognized after the projects are completed and when delivery is made or title and risk of loss otherwise transfers to the customer and the collection is reasonably assured revenues from it consulting services domain and hosting and maintenance services are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the length of the contract     the company also enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include web design and software development domain and hosting and maintenance and other services with the term ranging from one month to two years the company analyzes its agreements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards the “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” and staff accounting bulletin “sab”  “revenue recognition” allocation of revenue to individual elements that qualify for separate accounting is based on the element’s fair value in accordance with asc  and related revenues are recognized pursuant to the criteria described above during the year ended december   in one of the arrangements that contain multiple deliverables the company acted as an agent in the transaction as the agent it records revenues on a net basis customer payments received in advance of the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenues in the balance sheets and are recognized as revenue when the web and it services are rendered   cost of revenues – cost of revenues includes all costs associated with the providing website development and it services for its clients and primarily consists of subcontracted services   earnings loss per share  – basic earnings loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued at june   the company had a  loan from a stockholder which is convertible on demand management has not determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at june     stockbased compensation  – the company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with fasb asc  “compensation stock compensation” and fasb asc  “equity based payments to nonemployees” costs are measured at the estimated fair value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the value of the equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services   f    related parties – a related party is generally defined as i any person that holds  or more of the company’s securities and their immediate families ii the companys management iii someone that directly or indirectly controls is controlled by or is under common control with the company or iv anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the company a transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties   income taxes  – the company records income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards accounting standards regarding income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a morelikelythannot realization threshold this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods the company’s experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives   the company recorded valuation allowances on the net deferred tax assets management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets based on the accounting standards for income taxes each reporting period to the extent that the financial results of operations improve and it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable the company will be able to reduce the valuation allowance   significant judgment is required in evaluating the company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than  likely based solely on the technical merits of being sustained on examinations the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes   fair value of financial instruments – the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows   f    level  – inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  – inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly   level  – inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability   the company does not have any financial assets or liabilities that are required to be fair valued on a recurring basis for certain of the companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivables accounts payable and accrued liabilities amounts due to related parties and income tax payable the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short maturities   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive free market dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated it is not however practical to determine the fair value of amounts due fromto related parties due to their related party nature    foreign currency transactions and translation – the company records and settles all transactions in us dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each transaction date therefore there are no translation adjustments at the balance sheet date that should be included in accumulated other comprehensive income   accounting standards note yet adopted   in august  fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date” the amendments in asu  defer the effective date of asu  for all entities by one year public business entities certain notforprofit entities and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in asu  to annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   in november  the fasb issued asu  “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” which changes how deferred taxes are classified on the company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted asu  requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent upon adoption we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the company has no deferred tax assets and liabilities at march   and recorded a valuation allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at december     f    in february  the fasb issued asu  leases topic  which supersedes asc  leases  this asu is based on the principle that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases  the asu does not significantly change the lessees’ recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard  leases are classified as finance or operating  the asu’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating lease arrangements  lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less  lessors’ accounting under the asc is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard  in addition the asu expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements  lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach which includes a number of practical expedients  the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted  management continues to assess the overall impact the adoption of asu  will have on the company’s financial statements    in march  the fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net” the amendments in this asu are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance the effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic ” public entities should apply the amendments in asu  for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods therein the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu  “compensation  stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” the amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment award transactions are simplified including a income tax consequences b classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and c classification on the statement of cash flows the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements       going concern   the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction

the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   under asc topic no  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  likely of being realized on examination for tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test no tax benefit is recorded   management has analyzed the company’s material tax positions and has determined that no material uncertain tax positions exist that require recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows   f    level  – inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  – inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly   level  – inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the company does not have any financial assets or liabilities that are required to be fair valued on a recurring basis for certain of the companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivables prepaid expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred revenue the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short maturities   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated it is not however practical to determine the fair value of amounts due fromto related parties due to their related party nature    foreign currency transactions and translation   the company records and settles all transactions in us dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each transaction date therefore there are no translation adjustments at the balance sheet date that should be included in accumulated other comprehensive income   accounting standards not yet adopted   in august  fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date” the amendments in asu  defer the effective date of asu  for all entities by one year public business entities certain notforprofit entities and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in asu  to annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   in november  the fasb issued asu  “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” which changes how deferred taxes are classified on the company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted asu  requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent upon adoption we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the company has recorded a valuation allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at december   and    f    in february  the fasb issued asu  leases topic  which supersedes asc  leases  this asu is based on the principle that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases  the asu does not significantly change the lessees’ recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard  leases are classified as finance or operating  the asu’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating lease arrangements  lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less  lessors’ accounting under the asc is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard  in addition the asu expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements  lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach which includes a number of practical expedients  the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted  management continues to assess the overall impact the adoption of asu  will have on the company’s financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net” the amendments in this asu are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance the effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic ” public entities should apply the amendments in asu  for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods therein the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu  “compensation  stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” the amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment award transactions are simplified including a income tax consequences b classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and c classification on the statement of cash flows the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   going concern   the

company has incurred losses since inception and has a deficit accumulated of  as of december   the company requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities the company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown the obtainment of additional financing the successful development of the company’s contemplated plan of operations and its transition ultimately to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the company to continue operations the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties   f    note   related party transactions   in february  a company stockholder advanced the company  and the cash was received in may  the advance is unsecured bears no

section  of the  delaware general corporation law referred to as the dgcl  provides that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened pending or completed action suit or proceeding whether civil criminal administrative or investigative other than an action by or in the right of the corporation by reason of the fact that he is or was a director officer employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director officer employee or agent of another corporation partnership joint venture trust or other enterprise against expenses including attorneys fees judgments fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful a similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions ie actions by or in the right of the corporation except that indemnification extends only to expenses including attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such action and the statute requires court approval before there can be any indemnification where the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation   our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions that limit the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the dgcl consequently our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except liability a for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders b for any act or omission not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law c under section  of the dgcl regarding unlawful dividends and stock purchases or d for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit   any amendment to or repeal of these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any act omission or claim that occurred or arose prior to that amendment or repeal if the dgcl is amended to provide for further limitations on the personal liability of directors or officers of corporations then the personal liability of our directors and officers will be further limited to the fullest extent permitted by the dgcl   in addition we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our current directors and officers containing provisions that are in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the dgcl              these indemnification agreements will require us among other things to indemnify our directors against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified we also intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our future directors and officers we intend to maintain liability insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities including certain liabilities under arising under the securities act and the exchange act that may be incurred by them in their capacity as such   insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to directors officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions we have been informed that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable    item     recent sales of unregistered securities   on june   the company offered and sold  shares of common stock to richard chiang its sole officer and director in exchange for incorporation fees and annual resident agent fees in the state of delaware and developing our business concept and plan the company sold these shares of common stock under the exemption from registration provided by section  of the securities act   on february   the sole officer and director of the company mr chiang entered into a share purchase agreement the “spa” pursuant to which he entered into an agreement to sell an aggregate of  shares of his shares of the company’s common stock to elitesoft asia sdn bhd these shares represented  of the company’s issued and outstanding common stock effective upon the closing date of the spa mr chiang resigned from his positions and owned no shares of the company’s stock and elitesoft asia sdn bhd was the majority stockholder of the company effective on the same date and following the execution of the spa elitesoft asia sdn bhd elected eugene wong as a director of the company and transferred its shares to the officers and directors of the company   we relied upon section  of the securities act of  as amended for the above issuances we believed that section  was available because     • none of these issuances involved underwriters underwriting discounts or commissions         • we placed restrictive legends on all certificates issued         • no sales were made by general solicitation or advertising         • sales were made only to accredited investors        in connection with the above transactions we provided the following to all investors     • access to all our books and records         • access to all material contracts and documents relating to our operations         • the opportunity to obtain any additional information to the extent we possessed such information necessary to verify the accuracy of the information to which the investors were given access the company’s board of directors has the power to issue any or all of the authorized but unissued common stock without stockholder approval the company currently has no commitments to issue any shares of common stock other than the shares associated with the conversion of the shareholder loan with elitesoft asia as disclosed above however the company will in all likelihood issue a substantial number of additional shares in connection with a business combination since the company expects to issue additional shares of common stock in connection with a business combination existing stockholders of the company may experience substantial dilution in their shares however it is impossible to predict whether a business combination will ultimately result in dilution to existing shareholders if the target has a relatively weak balance sheet a business combination may result in significant dilution if a target has a relatively strong balance sheet there may be little or no dilution   item     exhibits and financial statement schedules   the exhibits to the registration statement are listed in the exhibit index attached hereto and incorporated by

investment in the shares offered for resale by the selling stockholders is highly speculative in nature involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for persons who can afford to risk the loss of the entire amount invested  before purchasing any of these securities you should carefully consider the following factors relating to our business and prospects  if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment    risks related to our business and industry   other it solutions exist in the marketplace and thus the space is highly competitive   due to the growing savviness of it users in overall the business of it solutions services is highly competitive and ever demanding in terms of speed and comprehensiveness smaller companies and individual freelancer of it services provider have mushroomed within the region in the recent years to cater to every need of businesses however with the established of our presence in within the asian countries and team of experts it specialists we are able to compete in the market competitively our network of business contacts within the asian region have grown to allow us to tap on to them for potential new business   our failure to obtain capital may significantly restrict our proposed operations   we will need to raise capital to expand our business it is anticipated that we will require an additional capital raise of  million dollars over the next twentyfour months to fund our business plans future sources of capital may not be available to us when we need it or may be available only on unacceptable terms   we are subject to the risk that certain key personnel including key employees named below on whom we depend in part for our operations will cease to be involved with us  the loss of any these individuals would adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our operations   we are dependent on the experience knowledge skill and expertise of our chairman of the board chief executive officer and president eugene wong we are also in large part dependent on our director chief financial officer and secretary khoo mae ling and cornelius ee our vice president of it the loss of any of these key personnel could materially and adversely affect our future business efforts our success depends in substantial part upon the services efforts and abilities of mr wong due to his experience history and knowledge of the business of and services provided by the company the inability of the company to retain the services of mr wong or to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations  we do not currently carry keyman life insurance on mr wong or any of our officers and have no present plans to obtain this insurance      competition from other information technology related companies in the same space could result in a decrease our business and a decrease in our financial performance   we operate in the highly competitive industry many of our current and potential competitors including alibaba ebay amazon rakuten groupon asos expedia and other have existed longer and have larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing personnel technical and other resources than the company in addition many of these competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to research and development of new products attracting and retaining key employees maintaining a large budget for marketing and promotional expenses and providing more favorable credit terms to suppliers and channel distributors        the relative lack of public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage   as a company with a class of securities registered under the exchange act we are subject to reporting and other legal accounting corporate governance and regulatory requirements imposed by the exchange act and rules and regulations promulgated under the exchange act  mr wong lacks public company experience which could impair our ability to comply with these legal accounting and regulatory requirements  such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis  our senior management may not be able to implement and effect programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal and regulatory compliance and reporting requirements our failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and further result in the deterioration of our business    regulations including those contained in and issued under the sarbanesoxley act of  “sox” and the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  “doddfrank” increase the cost of doing business and may make it difficult for us to retain or attract qualified officers and directors which could adversely affect the management of our business and our ability to obtain or retain listing of our common stock   the current regulatory climate for public companies even small and emerging growth companies such as ours may make it difficult or prohibitively expensive to attract and retain qualified officers directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management in compliance with the rules and regulations which govern publiclyheld companies including but not limited to certifications from executive officers and requirements for financial experts on boards of directors the perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles  for example the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in the issuance of a series of new rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the sec  further recent and proposed regulations under doddfrank heighten the requirements for board or committee membership particularly with respect to an individual’s independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications if we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors the management of our business could be adversely affected   the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management which could make it difficult to manage our business particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company”   we are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements including those required by the sec complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements are timeconsuming and expensive and could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and requirements of sox the cost of complying with these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition sox requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures we must commit significant resources may be required to hire additional staff and need to continue to provide effective management oversight we will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join the company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion these activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   as an “emerging growth company” we may take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of sox and rules and regulations of the sec thereunder which we refer to as section  and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements when these exemptions cease to apply we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years although we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — jobs act” for additional information on when we may cease to be deemed to be an emerging growth company we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs        our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business   we are subject to various sec reporting and other regulatory requirements we have incurred and will continue to incur expenses and to a lesser extent diversion of our management’s time in our efforts to comply with sox section  regarding internal controls over financial reporting  our management’s evaluation over our internal controls over financial reporting may determine that material weaknesses in our internal control exist  if in the future management identifies material weaknesses or our external auditors are unable to attest that our management’s report is fairly stated or to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls this could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports have an adverse effect on our stock price and subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities    limitations on director and officer liability and our indemnification of our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director     our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide with certain exceptions as permitted by delaware corporation law that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct fraud or knowing violation of law or unlawful payments of dividends these provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by governing state law      we may incur a variety of costs to engage in future acquisitions of companies products or technologies to grow our business to expand into new markets or to provide new services  as such the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions may never be realized   it is management’s intention to acquire other businesses to grow our customer base to expand into new markets and to provide new product lines  we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in complementary companies products or technologies although no additional material acquisitions or investments are currently pending  acquisitions may be accompanied by risks such as    • difficulties in assimilating the operations and employees of acquired companies   • diversion of our management’s attention from ongoing business concerns   • our potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and services   • additional expense associated with amortization of acquired assets   • additional expense associated with understanding and development of acquired business   • maintenance and implementation of uniform standards controls procedures and policies and   • impairment of existing relationships with employees suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new management employees    we must attract and retain skilled personnel  if we are unable to hire and retain technical sales and marketing and operational employees our business could be harmed   our revenues are generated by the sales of our information technology products and services from our direct sales and to a lesser extent our website  our ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent on our ability to develop and retain an effective sales force and qualified technical and managerial personnel we intend to hire additional employees including software developers sales and marketing employees and operational employees  the competition for developers and programmers qualified sales and managerial personnel in the information technology community is intense and we may not be able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel  in addition we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations control our costs maintain compliance with all applicable regulations and expand our internal management technical information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth which could have an adverse impact on our operations         our failure to manage growth effectively could harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel and adversely impact our operating results   there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expansion through acquisitions effectively our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth damage our reputation and negatively affect our financial performance and harm our business    if we obtain financing existing shareholder interests may be diluted   if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be diluted in addition any new securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock furthermore we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when and to the extent we require or that if available it will be on acceptable terms   in addition in the event the convertible note with mr ee chang ku a director and shareholder of elitesoft asia a shareholder and affiliate of the company is converted into shares of the company’s common stock there will be a dilutive impact on all shareholders furthermore since the actual conversion rate has yet to be definitively agreed upon by the company and mr ee chang ku the scope and breadth of the dilutive impact might be greater than anticipated which would have an impact on the overall holdings of all shareholders also if we elect to raise additional funds by issuing additional restricted stock or through convertible debt the shareholders will be diluted to the extent of the specific issuance or subsequent conversion and any new securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock or stock registered herein   a large percentage of our business come from international operations and may affect financial results in us dollar terms and could negatively impact our financial results   a large percentage of our revenues come from international operations between january   and june   our revenues generated from international operations were  which is  of total revenue we expect this trend to continue into the near future and have no system in place to combat currency risk   we lack a history of profitable operations and our auditor has issued an opinion about our ability to continue as a going concern   the lack of profitable operations as set forth in our financial statements herein and our auditor’s opinion and report that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern materially affects and impairs our business plan and objectives set forth herein   our officers and directors do not reside in the united states which might make service of process of any civil complaint not practical or achievable   the company is incorporated in the state of delaware however our directors and officers reside outside the united states as a result to the extent claims arise against the directors and officers securing service of process on the directors and officers might not be practicable achievable or possible   our failure to obtain capital may significantly restrict our proposed operations   we will need to raise capital to expand our business it is anticipated that we will require an additional capital raise of  million dollars over the next twentyfour months to fund our business plans we do not have adequate or sufficient capital resources or liquidity to carry out our shortterm or longterm business plans and our auditor has issued a report that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern which will materially affect and impair these objectives we have been internally funding through our shareholders officers and directors and through a convertible note as disclosed herein and from revenue generated through our performance under our agreement with ashita which is now concluded there is no guarantee that we will secure similar revenues from current or future customers or that our shareholders will continue to fund the operations of the business although our intention is to utilize the funding through the sale of selling shareholder shares in this registration statement there is no guarantee that such funding will occur or that a selling shareholder will agree to continue to fund the shortterm or longterm business plans of the company future sources of capital may not be available to us when we need it or may be available only on unacceptable terms        risks related to our common stock   our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly   once our shares begin trading the market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile in part because our shares have not been traded publicly in addition the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors most of which we cannot control including   • competition from other information technology companies or related businesses   • changes in key personnel   • entry into new geographic markets   • actions and announcements by us or our competitors or significant acquisitions divestitures strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments   • fluctuations in quarterly operating results as well as differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors   • the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties including our filings with the sec   • announcements relating to litigation   • financial guidance if any that we provide to the public any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance   • changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock   • the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock   • future sales of our common stock by our officers directors and significant stockholders and   • changes in accounting principles affecting our financial reporting    these and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance the stock markets and trading facilities including the otc bulletin board have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities in many companies in the past stockholders of some companies have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business          our common stock is subject to risks arising from restrictions on reliance on rule  by shell companies or former shell companies   under a regulation of the sec known as “rule ” a person who has beneficially owned restricted securities of an issuer and who is not an affiliate of that issuer may sell them without registration under the securities act provided that certain conditions have been met one of these conditions is that such person has held the restricted securities for a prescribed period which will be  months or  year depending on various factors the holding period for our common stock would be  year if our common stock could be sold under rule  however rule  is unavailable for the resale of securities issued by an issuer that is a shell company other than a business combination related shell company or that has been at any time previously a shell company the sec defines a shell company as a company that has a no or nominal operations and b either i no or nominal assets ii assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or iii assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets until the merger we were a shell company the sec has provided an exception to this unavailability if and for as long as the following conditions are met      • the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company   • the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of section  or d of the exchange act   • the issuer of the securities has filed all exchange act reports and material required to be filed as applicable during the preceding  months or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials other than current reports on form k and   • at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the sec reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company known as “form  information”      as a result although the registration statement on form  originally filed with the sec on july   intended to provide “form  information” the original form  stated only that the company was a blankcheck shell seeking a transaction with another entity  on september   the company filed a current report on form k frequently referred to as a “super k” to provide additional information about the company’s planned operations contracts shareholders management financial position and other information constituting “form  information” under the sec’s regulations     because of the company’s history as a shell company stockholders who receive our restricted securities will be able to sell them pursuant to rule  without registration for only as long as we continue to meet those requirements and are not a shell company no assurance can be given that we will meet these requirements or that we will continue to do so or that we will not again be a shell company furthermore any nonregistered securities we sell in the future or issue for acquisitions or to consultants or employees in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose will have limited or no liquidity until and unless such securities are registered with the sec andor until a year after we have complied with the requirements of rule  as a result it may be harder for us to fund our operations to acquire assets and to pay our consultants with our securities instead of cash furthermore it will be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the sec which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future in addition if we are unable to attract additional capital it could have an adverse impact on our ability to implement our business plan and sustain our operations  our status as a former “shell company” could prevent us from raising additional funds engaging consultants and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions which could cause the value of our securities if any to decline in value or become worthless     future sales of our common stock or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur may depress our stock price   sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after this offering or the perception that these sales could occur could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares upon completion of this offering we will have  shares of common stock outstanding  our shares of common stock offered in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the securities act except for any shares of our common stock that may be subsequently held or acquired by our directors executive officers and other “affiliates” as that term is defined in the securities act which will be restricted securities under the securities act restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the securities act or an exemption from registration is available   in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you        if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline   the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business we do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts if no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted if we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceased coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline   our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation   as a public company we are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting under section  in addition at such time as we cease to be an “emerging growth company” as more fully described in these risk factors we will be required to comply with section  at such time we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of section  in addition if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls as such standards are modified supplemented or amended from time to time we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations if we are not able to implement the requirements of section  in a timely manner or with adequate compliance our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the sec as a result there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements in addition we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows    our management and other affiliates have significant control of our common stock and could control our actions in a manner that conflicts with the interests of other stockholders   after the offering we anticipate that our executive officers directors and their affiliated entities together will beneficially own the majority of our common stock representing the majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as a result these stockholders acting together will be able to exercise considerable influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and may not always act in the best interests of other stockholders such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices        we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future   the continued operation and growth of our business will require substantial cash accordingly we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations financial condition contractual restrictions relating to indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant accordingly if you purchase shares in this offering realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock   antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable   our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of us more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions among other things   • authorize the issuance of previously undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued at the discretion of our board of directors without stockholder approval and which may include supermajority voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock   • prohibit stockholder action by written consent which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders   • provide that only the chairperson of our board of directors chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors may call a special meeting of stockholders   • provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws   • provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office even though less than a quorum and   • establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings   these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a changeincontrol even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire        cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements   information included in this prospectus may

prospectus   use of proceeds   the selling stockholders may sell all of the shares covered by this prospectus for their own accounts accordingly we will not receive any proceeds from the resale of the common stock    dividend policy   to date we have never declared dividends or paid cash dividends on our common stock in the future if we become profitable our board of directors may in its discretion declare a dividend on our common stock from our surplus earnings  there is no assurance that we will ever become profitable or that we will have surplus earnings from which a dividend can be paid  the declaration of dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon our earnings financial position general economic conditions and other pertinent factors   determination of offering price   the price of the shares offered by the selling stockholders is based ono a fixed pricing as a result of the selling shareholders being statutory underwriters we have no agreement written or oral with our selling stockholders about this price in this offering  the offering price may bear no relationship whatsoever to our assets earnings book value or other criteria of value the factors considered by a selling stockholder in setting the offer price for its shares might include   • the risk or unpredictable nature of our business    • the price at which we have sold our stock in offerings not registered under the securities act    • what the selling stockholders consider to be our growth potential    • the price at which we issued our common stock to certain of the selling stockholders in exchange for debt and for services and   • the price the selling stockholder believes a purchaser is willing to pay for our stock    prior to this offering there has been no market for our securities         market for common equity and related stockholder matters   market information   there is no established public trading market for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop or if developed may not be sustained a stockholder in all likelihood therefore will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she desire to do so when eligible for public resale furthermore it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans unless a regular trading market develops we have no plans proposals arrangements or understandings with any person with regard to the development of a trading market in any of our securities   penny stock considerations   our shares likely will be “penny stocks” as that term is generally defined in the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to mean equity securities with a price of less than  our shares thus will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock   under the penny stock regulations a brokerdealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited investor must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale generally an individual with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  individually or  together with his or her spouse is considered an accredited investor in addition under the penny stock regulations the brokerdealer is required to   • deliver prior to any transaction involving a penny stock a disclosure schedule prepared by the sec relating to the penny stock market unless the brokerdealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt   • disclose commissions payable to the brokerdealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities   • send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer’s account the account’s value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks and   • make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer’s account     because of these regulations brokerdealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock which may affect the ability of selling stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market these additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities if our securities become publicly traded in addition the liquidity for our securities may be decreased with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our stockholders will in all likelihood find it difficult to sell their securities   otc bulletin board qualification for quotation   to have our shares of common stock on the otc bulletin board a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock we intend on engaging spartan securities group ltd a finra market maker to file our application on form  with finra   holders

over time as we continue to field new orders inquires and engage new customers overseas we believe that korea and china will likely be a larger contributor to revenue within the next few years   due to the company’s lean structure and limited human resources there may be changes in cost of revenue from period to period for example web content development and auto tracking systems for crm were outsourced to third party vendors this resulted in substantial payments to third party vendors for the performance of the company’s material contracts   a factor in the company’s ability to comply with its contractual obligations is the performance of thirdparty vendors mr cornelius ee the company’s vice president of information technology is instrumental in coordinating with and supervising thirdparty vendors in order to complete work in a timely manner in order to comply with the company’s contractual obligations   additionally we are inexperienced as a public company and may find it difficult to meet all of the challenges and expenses of being a public company  we plan to raise capital by offering shares of our common stock or convertible debt to investors  for the next twentyfour months we anticipate we will need approximately  in additional capital to fund our business plans if we do not raise the required capital we may not meet our expenses and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so and if we do we may find the cost of such financing to be burdensome on the company additionally we may not be able to execute on our business plans due to

issuance of debt and equity securities we believe our current available cash along with anticipated revenues may be insufficient to meet our cash needs for the near future if we do not receive

policies   our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenues and expenses amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected significant areas requiring the use of estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts revenue recognition and determination of income tax expense we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements   we believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements we suggest that our significant accounting policies as described in our financial statements in the summary of significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   accounts receivable   accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are presented net of the allowance for doubtful accounts which represents the company’s best estimates of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance the company determines allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible and reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis        revenue recognition   the company derives its revenues primarily from providing web and it services web and it services revenues consist of fees from web design software development domain and hosting and maintenance and other services the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists services have been rendered the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured the companys service arrangements are generally noncancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event of cancellations the company records revenues net of sales taxes revenues from web design software development are generally recognized after the projects are completed and when delivery is made or title and risk of loss otherwise transfers to the customer and the collection is reasonably assured revenues from it consulting services domain and hosting and maintenance services are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the length of the contract   the company also enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include web design and software development domain and hosting and maintenance and other services with the term ranging from one month to two years the company analyzes its agreements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards the “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” and staff accounting bulletin “sab”  “revenue recognition” allocation of revenue to individual elements that qualify for separate accounting is based on the element’s fair value in accordance with asc  and related revenues are recognized pursuant to the criteria described above during the year ended december   in one of the arrangements that contain multiple deliverables the company acted as an agent in the transaction as the agent it records revenues on a net basis customer payments received in advance of the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenues in the balance sheets and are recognized as revenue when the web and it services are rendered   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  “income taxes” asc  requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  likely of being realized on examination for tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test no tax benefit is recorded the adoption had no effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements   the company calculates the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal and state tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes the company records the change in estimate in the period in which the company make the determination           we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to   • have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act   • comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis   • submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and   • disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceo’s compensation to median employee compensation        in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period   as an emerging growth company the company is exempt from section a and b of the securities exchange act of  which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes   the company is an emerging growth company under the jobs act of  but the company has irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section b of the jobs act          recent accounting pronouncements   in august  fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date” the amendments in asu  defer the effective date of asu  for all entities by one year public business entities certain notforprofit entities and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in asu  to annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   in november  the fasb issued asu  “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” which changes how deferred taxes are classified on the company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted asu  requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent upon adoption we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the company has no deferred tax assets and liabilities at march   and recorded a valuation allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at december     in february  the fasb issued asu  leases topic  which supersedes asc  leases  this asu is based on the principle that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases  the asu does not significantly change the lessees’ recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard  leases are classified as finance or operating  the asu’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating lease arrangements  lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less  lessors’ accounting under the asc is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard  in addition the asu expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements  lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach which includes a number of practical expedients  the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted  management continues to assess the overall impact the adoption of asu  will have on the company’s financial statements    in march  the fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net” the amendments in this asu are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance the effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic ” public entities should apply the amendments in asu  for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods therein the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu  “compensation  stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” the amendments are effective for

securities   general   the following summary includes a description of material provisions of the company’s capital stock   authorized capital stock   the authorized capital stock of the company

hereinafter referred to in this section as the “preferred stock” par value  per share of which none have been designated or issued the following summarizes important information regarding our capital stock   common stock   holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends if any as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors in its discretion from funds legally available in the event of a liquidation dissolution or winding up of the company the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata all assets remaining after payment in full of all liabilities all of the outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable holders of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the company’s common stock there are no conversion or redemption rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock   preferred stock   the board of directors is authorized by our certificate of incorporation to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock in series and by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of delaware to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation powers preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the stockholders any shares of preferred stock so issued would have priority over the common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights any future issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock at present we have no plans to neither issue any preferred stock nor adopt any series preferences or other classification of preferred stock   the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock although the board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock the board of directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock unless otherwise required by law or stock exchange rules we have no present plans to issue any preferred stock   the description of certain matters relating to the securities of the company is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement on form  filed with the sec on july          dividends   we have not paid any

subsequent to a business combination if any will be within the discretion of our then existing board of directors it is the present intention of our board of directors to retain all earnings if any

integration and applications solutions to five companies as identified above  we seek to provide these services primarily to the asiapacific region in particular countries such as singapore thailand indonesia japan hong kong korea and china we also find that markets in new zealand and australia are favorable to our industry as well and have begun marketing our efforts in those markets for the nine months ended september   as set forth in our notes to condensed financial statements on f in addition to generating revenue from these five companies one customer – ashita communication sdn bhd “ashita” accounted for  of our revenue the company has fully performed under the agreement with ashita see enclosed as exhibit the agreement has termed out we collected all payments under the agreement the company’s loss of this source of revenue will have an adverse effect on the company’s ongoing and future business and operations in the event the company is unable to replace this source of revenue        third party products      with the execution of our client agreements we began integrating systems from dell lenovo samsung apple huawei acer and asus our business strategy is to implement and integrate third party products into our clients network   marketing strategy   we plan on launching marketing in the asiapacific region through an online advertising campaign leveraging our experience and utilizing our business contacts in the asiapacific region   research and development activities   the company has limited resources to dedicate exclusively to research and development the company has spent less than  on internal research and development activities major contracts have been outsourced to thirdparty vendors including od alliance and elitesoft asia a related party and affiliate of the company these vendors provide the company with necessary consultancy technical knowledge and content for our contracts as a result the company relies on the thirdparty vendors in performing its contracts mr cornelius ee the company’s vice president of information technology is instrumental in coordinating with and supervising thirdparty vendors in order to complete work in a timely manner in order to comply with the company’s contractual obligations in the event one of our thirdparty vendors terminates its relationship with the company the company may be at risk of not fully performing its contractual obligations to its customers all amounts paid to thirdparty vendors are accounted for in our financials   industry competition and future operations the it web system integration and application solutions industry   the it web systems integration and applications solutions market is a highly fragmented industry there are numerous companies that have established businesses and command large market share such as accenture bae systems cognizant technology fujitsu hewlettpackard ibm infosys lockheed martin oracle tata consultancy that we compete against we also compete with alibaba ebay amazon rakuten groupon asos expedia and other ecommerce platform companies specifically in our ecommerce business in the asiapacific region additionally many of the vendor companies that the industry purchases products from may compete against their clients by offering full life cycle solutions and packages that support compatible software and hardware products a role that it web and system integrators normally play therefore emerging companies in our industry have taken to a full solution approach that offers clients a robust best of breed and customized software programming with a higher emphasis on customer service relations additionally in the asiapacific markets companies offer other options such as managing payroll and accounting as well as recruitment and human resources on behalf of clients to further differentiate themselves from competitors according to transparency market research in  the firm believes that the global market for system integration services was valued at  billion in  and is expected to reach  billion by  growing at a cagr compound annual growth rate of  during the period their assessment of the industry was that the asia pacific region was expected to be the fastest growing regional market for system integration during the forecasted period the rapidly growing economies of the asiapacific region and globalization of firms are key drivers in propelling demand for the it system integration and services business   our company has developed a strategy that will encompass a broader approach to traditional it web and system integration by focusing efforts on the emerging mobile payment industry our approach is to offer our clients full mobile payment integration with their it strategy and developing a competitive mobile solution to their commerce needs according to mckinsey a global business consultancy firm the asiapacific region will account for more than  of the global payments growth over the next five years and cashless transactions will increase by more than  growth in countries such as thailand vietnam indonesia and china        competition   the mobile payments industry in the asiapacific region is highly competitive given the outlook in the asiapacific region we believe that competition for revenues will intensify in the mobile payments space we compete with standalone players such as paypal netteller china union pay alipay and bitpay additionally we compete with three categories of institutional players nonbank payment companies asiapacific banks in home markets and banks in nonhome markets   nonbank payment companies are telecom or telco companies that are seeking to expand their existing technologies by offering mobile payment solutions integrated into mobile phones and consumer machines such as ticketing services asiapacific banks are banks in home markets in asia such as hsbc citi and standard chartered these banking institutions seek to increase their footprint with clients by offering mobile bank payment solutions in order to capture more revenue   banks in nonhome markets are banks outside the asiapacific region that offer competitive services with the objective to increase cash management services through either low cost fees or no fee accounts these banks are generally the least sophisticated members of the current competitive landscape based upon their inexperience in operating within the asiapacific region however the amount of financial resources these banks control are

audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period as reported in the form k have been omitted   use of estimates  – the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and

accounting standards codification “asc”  “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” and staff accounting bulletin “sab”  “revenue recognition” allocation of revenue to individual elements that

liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards accounting standards regarding income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a morelikelythannot realization threshold this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods the company’s experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives   the company recorded valuation allowances on the net deferred tax assets management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets based on the accounting standards for income taxes each reporting period to the extent that the financial results of operations improve and it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable the company will be able to reduce the valuation allowance   significant judgment is required in evaluating the company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than  likely based solely on the technical merits of being sustained on examinations the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes     f  fair value of financial instruments – the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  – inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  – inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly   level  – inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability   the company does not have any financial assets or liabilities that are required to be fair valued on a recurring basis for certain of the companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivables accounts payable and accrued liabilities amounts due to related parties and income tax payable the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short maturities   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive free market dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated it is not however practical to determine the fair value of amounts due fromto related parties due to their related party nature    foreign currency transactions and translation – the company records and settles all transactions in us dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each transaction date therefore there are no translation adjustments at the balance sheet date that should be included in accumulated other comprehensive income   accounting standards

leases topic  which supersedes asc  leases  this asu is based on the principle that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases  the asu does not significantly change the lessees’ recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard  leases are classified as finance or operating  the asu’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating lease arrangements  lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less  lessors’ accounting under the asc is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard  in addition the asu expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements  lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach which

strong focus on the financial sector ecommerce businesswebbased training and certification   note  –summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying audited financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the rules of the securities and exchange commission   concentrations   the company deposits cash with a national bank within the united states of america and at times throughout the year may maintain balances that exceed federally insured limits of  per depositor per insured bank there was no uninsured cash at december   or  the company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes the company is not exposed to any unusual credit risk on cash and cash equivalents   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are primarily in money market funds the carrying value of those investments approximates fair value   accounts receivable   accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are stated at the amount the company expects to collect from outstanding balances the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible management considers accounts receivable to be fully collectible at december     f    revenue recognition   the company derives its revenues primarily from providing web and it services web and it services revenues consist of fees from web design software development domain and hosting and maintenance and other services the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists services have been rendered the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured the companys service arrangements are generally noncancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event of cancellations the company records revenues net of sales taxes revenues from web design software development are generally recognized after the projects are completed and when delivery is made or title and risk of loss otherwise transfers to the customer and the collection is reasonably assured revenues from it consulting services domain and hosting and maintenance services are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the length of the contract     the company also enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include web design and software development domain and hosting and maintenance and other services with the term ranging from one month to two years the company analyzes its agreements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards the “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” and staff accounting bulletin “sab”  “revenue recognition” allocation of revenue to individual elements that qualify for separate accounting is based on the element’s fair value in accordance with asc  and related revenues are recognized pursuant to the criteria described above during the year ended december   in one of the arrangements that contain multiple deliverables the company acted as an agent in the transaction as the agent it records revenues on a net basis customer payments received in advance of the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenues in the balance sheets and are recognized as revenue when the web and it services are rendered   cost of revenues   cost of revenues includes all costs associated with the providing website development and it services for its clients and primarily consists of subcontracted services   earnings loss per share   basic earnings loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued at december   the company had a  note payable which is convertible on demand management has not determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at december     f    stockbased compensation   the company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation and fasb asc  equity based payments to nonemployees costs are measured at the estimated fair value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the value of the equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services   related parties   a related party is generally defined as i any person that holds  or more of the companys securities and their immediate families ii the companys management iii someone that directly or indirectly controls is controlled by or is under common control with the company or iv anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the company a transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic no  “income taxes” asc topic no  requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   under asc topic no  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  likely of being realized on examination for tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test no tax benefit is recorded   management has analyzed the company’s material tax positions and has determined that no material uncertain tax positions exist that require recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  – inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  – inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly   level  – inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability f      the company does not have any financial assets or liabilities that are required to be fair valued on a recurring basis for certain of the companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivables prepaid expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred revenue the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short maturities   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated it is not however practical to determine the fair value of amounts due fromto related parties due to their related party nature    foreign currency transactions and translation   the company records and settles all transactions in us dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each transaction date therefore there are no translation adjustments at the balance sheet date that should be included in accumulated other comprehensive income   accounting standards not yet adopted   in august  fasb issued asu  “revenue from

classified on the company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted asu  requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent upon adoption we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the company has recorded a valuation allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at december   and    in february  the fasb issued asu  leases topic  which supersedes asc  leases  this asu is based on the principle that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases  the asu does not significantly change the lessees’ recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard  leases are classified as finance or operating  the asu’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating lease arrangements  lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less  lessors’ accounting under the asc is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard  in addition the asu expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements  lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach which includes a number of practical expedients  the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year

other than an action by or in the right of the corporation by reason of the fact that he is or was a director officer employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director officer employee or agent of another corporation partnership joint venture trust or other enterprise against expenses including attorneys fees judgments fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful a similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions ie actions by or in the right of the corporation except that indemnification extends only to expenses including attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such action and the statute requires court approval before there can be any indemnification where the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation   our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions that limit the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the dgcl consequently our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except liability a for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders b for any act or omission not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law c under

provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any act omission or claim that occurred or arose prior to that amendment or repeal if the dgcl is amended to provide for further limitations on the personal liability of directors or officers of corporations then the personal liability of our directors and officers will be further limited to the fullest extent permitted by the dgcl   in addition we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our current directors and officers containing provisions that are in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the dgcl   these indemnification agreements will require us among other things to indemnify our directors against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified we also intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our future directors and officers we intend to maintain liability insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities including certain liabilities under arising under the securities act and the exchange act that may be incurred by them in their capacity as such   insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to directors officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions we have been informed that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable           item     recent sales of unregistered securities   on june   the company offered and sold  shares of

“assignment agreement” under the assignment agreement we acquired the nz financial limited technology services agreement the “nz agreement” from elite soft asia in consideration for  shares of the company’s restricted common stock   we relied upon section  of the securities act of  as amended for the above issuances we believed that section  was available because     • none of these issuances involved underwriters underwriting discounts or commissions         • we placed restrictive legends on all certificates issued         • no sales were made by general solicitation or advertising         • sales were made only to accredited investors   in connection with the above transactions we provided the following to all investors     • access to all our books and records         • access to all material contracts and documents relating to our operations         • the opportunity to obtain any additional information to the extent we possessed such information necessary to verify the accuracy of the information to which the investors were given access          the company’s board of directors has the power to issue any or all of the authorized but unissued common stock without stockholder approval the company currently has no commitments to issue any shares of common stock other than the shares associated with the conversion of the shareholder loan with elitesoft asia as disclosed above however the company will in all likelihood issue a substantial number of additional shares in connection with a business combination since the company expects to issue additional shares of common stock in connection with a business combination existing stockholders of the company may experience substantial dilution in their shares however it is impossible to predict whether a business combination will ultimately result in dilution to existing shareholders if the target has a relatively weak balance sheet a business combination may result in significant dilution if a target has a relatively strong balance sheet there may be little or no dilution   item     exhibits and financial statement schedules   the exhibits to the registration statement are listed in the exhibit
