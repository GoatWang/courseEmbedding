can achieve harder stronger longerlasting erections and improve your sex drive updated  pm est mon may   tom stakleff senior researcher mens health and wellness i’ve probably said this to you before but i’ll say it again as the senior researcher for men’s health and wellness at supplement review digest my mission is to empower you with knowledge that will help you find the best natural supplements i want you to be able to solve your problems and change your life for the better in regards to us men that means i have to address some issues that none of us like to talk about—like decreased sex drive the inability to get and stay hard and the confusing male enhancement industry millions of men around the world are afflicted by agerelated issues that make it difficult to gain and sustain an erection most of these men are between the ages of  and  like me there are various causes of our pain but the effects are all the same we feel guilty ashamed embarrassed and sexually frustrated there’s nothing more emasculating than not being able to perform for our partners today i’m going to help you find real solutions that thousands of other men have used to reinvigorate their sex lives first it’s important to understand that it’s not your fault don’t be ashamed the challenge of getting a hard lasting erection is something that just naturally happens to men of our age group you haven’t failed your partner unless you do nothing about it—but you’re reading this right now because you will do something about it so keep your head up the struggle to stay positive is one of the first hurdles you need to get over to improve your sex life the next hurdle is navigating the ludicrous male enhancement market you’ve seen all the false claims out there every company says they have all the answers you could easily develop a distrust of the entire industry a quick bit of research on pubmed or even just wikipedia or webmd will lead you to information about how some herbs really do help with sex drive and erection strength so there must be some legitimate supplements out there the struggle is in finding a company has the right combinations of highlyconcentrated herbs backed by research and science and that other men use again and again because it works it’s no wonder i’ve gotten so many emails asking what male enhancement pills i recommend some of you are so sick of the malarkey that you’re ready to resort to the “blue pill” i’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to you don’t need to suffer from extreme headaches just to get an erection and satisfy your partner i’m answering your calls for help today there are effective male enhancement supplements out there and i’m going to help you find them you can spend your money on something that is a legitimate investment in yourself and your health best of all you can attain the sexual satisfaction you deserve the science of erections you probably already know this by now but i’m going to rehash it just in case there are chambers in the penis that fill up with blood to make it erect the full process is a little bit more complicated than that but that’s the important part so to find an effective supplement you need to find something that helps the blood fill the chambers and keeps them filled there are several factors that can complicate this process some of the factors are mental depression stress anxiety some are physical circulation hormones diabetes a good supplement will address these factors and counteract any effect they might be having on your sex drive how to spot a scam these are my top  red flags i use to avoid throwing money away  prescription strength this might be obvious but be mindful of any herbal supplement that exaggerates its effectiveness if a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run sidebyside with a prescription drug immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide  free trial when a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info the subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel so whether the product works or not you’re stuck paying for it again and again  the product promises to add inches to your member as i mentioned before every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection those chambers determine the size of an erect penis aside from surgery there is no way to change the size of those chambers there is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth some supplements will claim to “maximize size” that’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers  if the website looks amateur this one is probably obvious if the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over be warned if a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer how can they afford to develop an effective supplement  if it’s not made in america foreignmade products are not subject to fda scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time some of these supplements may do more harm than good how to spot a lifechanger there are multiple ways to identify a good product i reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article for now here’s a general rule rather than look at the ingredients in the product look at the research behind the ingredients don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework or that won’t show it to you a credible company will share their research with you you know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide they will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results harder longerlasting erections improved sex drive maximized size boosted mood  confidence satisfied partners more intimate love life sexual satisfaction how we rated our winners now that i have helped you avoid the time and money wasters it’s time to fill you in on how my search for effective supplements went the male enhancement market is huge my research team and i sorted through hundreds of the supplements out there i’m
