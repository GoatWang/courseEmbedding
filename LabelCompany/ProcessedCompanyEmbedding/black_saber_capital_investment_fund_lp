hub writes by thomas krenik harvey powers and kelley rytlewski  private equity funds are the widely accepted investment strategy for pensions endowments family offices and other investors to access the private markets but the reported returns of pe funds are misleading representing only a partial view of the capital involved typically pe fund returns are shown for deployed capital which can persuade limited partners that a fund’s returns are higher than reality  — as much as  percent higher in fact by carefully considering a fund investment from an lp’s perspective we can first understand what reported returns do mean and then build a more holistic picture to appreciate the overstatement sitting on the lp side of the table what does it mean to invest in a pe fund legally an investor will sign a limitedpartnershipagreement stating their obligation to provide capital for future investments a large figure is committed to the fund up front and an lp naturally treats that commitment as a portfolio allocation to private equity in return according to preqin’s  pe report the top quartile of funds deliver a  percent irr and what fund admits to being outside the top quartile two inaccuracies with this  percent number exist one an assumption and the other an omission the assumption is as harvard business review points out the irr is calculated on a cashflow basis  with that analysis reported irrs imply that cash distributions from selling investments are reinvested at the same irr over the entire investment period that’s untrue unless lps can immediately deploy capital from pe investments into equally profitable opportunities as funds are distributed the omission — a piece missing entirely from funds’ calculations — is the hidden but considerable opportunity cost of committed capital committed capital the amount of money a limited partner dedicates to a fund which is deployed over several years as investments are identified funds structured with capital commitments are dubbed blind pools because investors commit into a fund without knowing exactly where the money will be invested the general partner will raise a fund essentially securing dry powder to fuel future investments and then will go out and source the exact deals over many years with the money close at hand when a new investment into the fund is secured the gp sends lps a capital call which requires delivery of their share of capital typically within five to  business days lps invested in pe funds must maintain highly liquid and stablevalue assets to respond to capital calls on such short notice such funds are typically held in lowyielding treasurys corporate bonds and liquid fixedincome index funds while on standby uncalled committed capital takes a double hit i paying full management fees and ii losing the excess returns expected from a pe allocation so how should an lp break down the  percent number and get to reality expected view a compounding black box if the reported returns met our expectations at face value we could think of pe investing as something quite simple a compounding black box money would go in time would pass and then more money would come out with net returns equal to  percent irr on everything we put in let’s draw out that logic over a typical fund lifespan of  years palico and scale down our initial investment to a single benjamin at time zero  goes in it works for  years making  percent each year and boom — we should get  at the end of the party right if only it were so simple unfortunately most investors quickly learn that their money does not go in all at once nor it is distributed in one lump sum inside view how a  percent fund irr really works we can modify our thinking to illustrate how a  investment is actually deployed piecewise over the investment period which is typically seven years terms of private equity funds when the investment period expires not all of our money was even deployed based on preqin data for the average deployment schedule funds actually invest around  percent of committed capital and the rest is released at the end of the investment period a little troublesome since those dollars paid fees while waiting which reminds us that we have to include management fees as an additional outflow during the investment period fees are generally highest at  percent of committed capital and drop to around  percent of invested capital for the remaining years the impact of full fees siphoned from large amounts of undrawn capital makes the fee drag particularly steep at the outset amplifying what investors call the jcurve jcurve a shorthand to describe an lp’s returns when investing in funds initially capital calls and management fees are negative cash flows before portfoliocompany exits bring positive cashflow distributions in later years now for the good part distributions we can expect distributions to start after year  and continue until the end of the fund following historical aggregated fund numbers we can translate a distribution schedule into dollar amounts in our assumptions deals last five years and distributions are shown after performance fees calculated using a standard  percent carried interest and  percent hurdle rate if you were thinking of a pe fund as a black box the results under this new picture are painful while our irr remained  percent instead of the  output we expected we’re only getting  but funds aren’t lying about their irrs so what happened well the time that our money spent deployed in the box decreased from our original thinking instead of all of it spending the full  years deployed our dollars were deployed piece by piece over seven years and exited five years after they went to work the cash inflows and outflows at their respective times equal a  percent irr after fees but now we are much less pleased this reveals how most funds can report fantastic returns on deployed capital the method is equivalent to a hedge fund storing most of its assets in cash and measuring its performance only on capital active in the market it fails to provide a holistic picture of the manager’s aum performance by viewing only the dollars going directly in and directly out of a fund we can be fooled into thinking this models the return on our initial investment the crisp benjamin we first put onto the table gave up better opportunities for returns to sit and wait as dry powder for the fund manager the cost of this committedbutuncalled allocation must be appropriately tracked from time zero — not when it was deployed but when it was set aside as committed capital enlightened view accounting for the opportunity cost of committed capital committed capital creates a significant shortterm liability and lps need to hold highly liquid stable assets to meet capital calls on short notice consequently lps typically increase holdings in liquid fixedincome assets which optimistically generate a  percent to  percent irr essentially offsetting management fees but little more maintaining liquidity for committed capital is required to support a pe fund investment as a result we must include the opportunity cost in the fund return equation to incorporate committed capital we immediately invest our committed capital in highly liquid stable assets these assets distribute  percent annually and after seven years the investment period our remaining committed capital is released once we include all of the boxes that our capital is in for a fund investment our actual irr returns are much much lower here’s the second revelation our total dollars out actually increased slightly with an additional  earned on committedbutuncalled capital to  from  ­ —  but because we are now including committed capital as an investment active on the table our irr decreases to  from  remember irrs are calculated based on cash flows in and out funds don’t consider dollars ‘in’ until they are deployed investors must consider their dollars ‘in’ when they are committed as their liability to the fund is immediately moved into liquid holdings earning minimal returns time ticking against that idle capital lowers the irr of a fund investment dramatically investors need to be mindful of this reality reported fund returns can overstate the truth by ignoring the effects of committed capital — a sleight of hand that can inflate the real number by  percent or more outside the largest institutions in the world few investors can mitigate the costs of committed capital all investors in pe funds need to be aware that their returns are not as advertised the pe asset class still performs incredibly well when compared with peers but the fund structure is a far cry from a compounding black box this article was originally published on nov
