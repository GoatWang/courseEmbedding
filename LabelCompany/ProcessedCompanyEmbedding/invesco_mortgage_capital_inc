performance of us dollardenominated investment grade floating rate notes there are risks involved with investing in etfs including possible loss of money actively managed etfs do not necessarily seek to replicate the performance of a specified index actively managed etfs are subject to risks similar to stocks including those related to short selling and margin maintenance ordinary brokerage commissions apply the funds return may not match the return of the index the fund is subject to certain other risks please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the fund the investment techniques and risk analysis used by the portfolio managers may not produce the desired results fixedincome investments are subject to credit risk of the issuer and the effects of changing interest rates interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa an issuer may be unable to meet interest andor principal payments thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuers credit rating junk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuers credit quality the values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods investments focused in a particular industry or sector are subject to greater risk and are more greatly impacted by market volatility than more diversified investments the fund invests in shortterm instruments which generally provide lower returns than longerterm fixed income securities active trading of portfolio securities may result in added expenses a lower return and increased tax liability the fund is nondiversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment  the fund may hold illiquid securities that it may be unable to sell at the preferred time or price and could lose its entire investment in such securities the fund currently intends to effect creations and redemptions principally for cash rather than principally inkind because of the nature of the funds investments as such investments in the fund may be less tax efficient than investments in etfs that create and redeem inkind if interest rates fall it is possible that issuers of callable securities will call or prepay their securities before maturity causing the fund to reinvest proceeds in securities bearing lower interest rates and reducing the funds income and distributions risks of collateralized loan obligations include the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default the collateralized loan obligations may be subordinate to other classes values may be volatile and disputes with the issuer may produce unexpected investment results defaulted securities involve the substantial risk that principal will not be repaid and may be subject to restrictions on resale an investment in exchangetraded funds etfs may trade at a discount to net asset value fail to develop an active trading market halt trading on the listing exchange fail to track the referenced index or hold troubled securities etfs may involve duplication of management fees and certain other expenses certain of the etfs the fund invests in are leveraged which can magnify any losses on those investments for mortgagebacked securities if interest rates rise borrowers may prepay mortgages more slowly than originally expected this may further reduce market value and lengthen durations instruments issued by government agencies including the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac are generally only backed by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the issuing government agency and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as a result there is uncertainty as to the current status of many obligations that are placed under conservatorship of the federal government income generated from the fund is based primarily on prevailing interest rates which can vary widely over the short and longterm if interest rates drop the funds income may drop as well preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer to defer or omit distributions for a certain period of time and reporting the distribution for tax purposes may be required even though the income may not have been received further preferred securities may lose substantial value due to the omission or deferment of dividend payments reinvestment risk is the risk that a bonds cash flows coupon income and principal repayment will be reinvested at an interest rate below that on the original bond obligations issued by us government agencies and instrumentalities may receive varying levels of support from the government which could affect the funds ability to recover should they default select a product bldrs asia  adr index fund bldrs developed markets  adr index fund bldrs emerging markets  adr index fund bldrs europe select
