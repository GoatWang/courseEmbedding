the other named executive officers of scheringplough and the vice president and controller the principal accounting officer of scheringplough ceased to serve in their respective positions   e

each became eligible to receive severance payments and benefits in accordance with his or her individual employment agreements   that coupled with this from new mercks corresponding sec form k at page  makes it definitive  only the merckified officers as previouslynamed shall rule   effective as of the closing date the following individuals each of whom is an officer of new merck and old merck were elected to serve as directors of old merck together with richard t clark kenneth c frazier peter n kellogg and bruce n kuhlik following the closing date the individuals serving as members of the board of directors of old merck will not receive any separate compensation for their role as a director of old merck   no huge surprise there  just good to see  in definitive form travel well ms cox  but travel light  as its now whiskey for my men and beer for my horses time ref a ditty by willy nelson and toby keith  of a few years passed posted by condor at  pm labels ceo fred hassan carrie smith cox pharmacia upjohn pfizer largest federal criminal fine ever bextra celebrex november    comments anonymous said condorit was noticed that the bayer productsavelox levitra etc that sp promoted did not make it over to merck these products are not listed in the new merck website but the other sp products arehow could one verify the status of these productsany thoughts november   at  am condor said well  ill look around but ive seen nothing to suggest that new merck has sold off those lines in fact the sec forms k filed last night for both new and old merck should have listed any material disposition of assets in conjunction with completeing the reverse mergerbustupmy hunch is that ceo clark is just going to emphasize the products he wants to emphasizewhile not definitive see this at page  as to avelox patient assistance programs formerly by scheirngplough now operated by merck and this as to levitra note that in both cases the address hosting the forms is merckcomso merck continues to run patient affordability programs for these drugs  and it seems unlikely whitehouse station would do so if it were no longer receiving revenue from these linesill keep checkin around thoughcertainly bayer would announce its reacquisition of these rights if it had in fact reacquired themand it hasnt at least not yetremember also that gsk is part of the levitra arrangement and there has been no announcement there either in fact merck has other relationships with gsk  on mevacorso i could be wrong but i wouldnt read too much into itinteresting thoughnamaste november   at  am post
