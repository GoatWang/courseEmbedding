orthopedic surgeons rheumatologists and pain specialists hydrostacurrent joint injection or intraarticular treatments for oa pain include corticosteroids commonly known as steroids which provide shortterm relief and viscosupplements which provide pain relief over the longerterm in contrast hydrosta utilizes cbyls proprietary crosslinking technology to deliver both rapid pain relief with a low dose steroid triamcinolone acetonide or ta and sustained pain relief with cbyls proprietary hyaluronic acid viscosupplement hydrosta is a combination ia product designed to provide both rapid and sustained pain relief cbyl believes the low dose steroid component of hydrosta will provide rapid pain relief as well as sustained pain relief up to six months from cbyls proprietary hyaluronic acid

ultimately underlying bone oa results in inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the joint which worsens over time and leads to progressive thinning of articular cartilage symptoms of this disease include pain stiffness swelling and limitation in the function of the joint there is no known way to reverse the progression of oa and while there are a number of therapeutic options to treat the pain associated with oa even with treatment the disease typically continues to progress and patients may eventually require joint replacement surgery often referred to as total knee arthroplasty or tka relative to therapeutic options to treat the pain tka is very expensive with a cost of approximately  to  for an initial surgery and  for a revision surgery thereby resulting in a meaningful burden on the healthcare system oa severity is generally graded on a scale from one to four when oa advances and oral or topical drug treatments are not sufficient to effectively address the associated pain physicians often turn to ia treatments such as steroids and hyaluronic acid or ha viscosupplements while steroid injections can provide rapid pain relief they generally provide only shortterm pain relief of two to four weeks post injection on the other hand while ha injections can often provide longterm pain relief of up to approximately six months they do not generally begin to provide peak pain relief until five weeks post injection as a result cbyl believes there is a significant unmet medical need for a single product that provides both rapid and sustained pain relief in a safe and effective manner intellectual propertyin november  cbyl entered into a technology license agreement with jingfeng pursuant to which cbyl granted jingfeng the exclusive right and license to develop manufacture and commercialize hydrosta or any improvements or modifications of hydrosta for human and veterinary uses in china taiwan hong kong and macau in these countries jingfeng

is the owner of record of four issued or allowed us patents and eight issued or allowed nonus patents and cbyl is actively pursuing an additional two us patent applications and  nonus patent applications cbyl also relies on trade secrets and careful monitoring of its proprietary information to protect aspects of its business that are not amenable to or that cbyl does not consider appropriate for patent protection competitionthe key competitive factors affecting the success of hydrosta if approved are likely to be efficacy durability safety price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payors cbyl believes it will compete favorably by having a fastacting long lasting effective candidate that has a validated mechanism of action for oa pain relief and an attractive safety profile intraarticular therapiescurrently available steroid injections are effective at providing pain relief within a couple of days but they do not last for more than about a month and can have a damaging effect on the healthy cartilage most of these steroid injections are interchangeable with the choice usually stemming from cost to the patient and
