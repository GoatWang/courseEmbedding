items on amazoncom one little device outshined the rest last year steve symington tmfsymington jan   at pm amazoncom nasdaqamzn recently confirmed it shipped over a billion items this holiday season recent estimates are predicting that the online retail juggernaut will post  revenue of roughly  billion good for yearoveryear growth of  i cant help but wonder which of those items was the online retail juggernauts most popular over the last year perhaps unsurprisingly amazon just confirmed its bestselling product in  was one of its own making the new alexaenabled echo dot echo dot was the bestselling product on all of amazoncom last year image source amazoncom inc echo dots great enabler according to a recent press release from amazon echo dot is the bestselling most gifted item on amazoncom with millions sold worldwide since launch echo and echo dot were the bestselling products across amazon this year elaborated amazon worldwide consumer ceo jeff wilke and were thrilled that millions of new customers will be introduced to alexa as a result despite our best efforts and rampedup production we still had trouble keeping them in stock in case youre unfamiliar alexa is amazons virtual personal assistant  or as amazon puts it the brain behind echo dot with the help of farfield voicerecognition technology and an array of seven microphones in echo dot  a delightfully small handsfree device that can be placed anywhere in your home  consumers can perform a staggering array of tasks using only voice commands such as playing music ordering a pizza requesting virtually any information calling a ride from uber controlling compatible smarthome devices and of course ordering items from amazoncom because alexa is a cloudbased service amazon can also make it smarter automatically adding new features without requiring any action from consumers over time alexa even adapts to users speech patterns vocabulary and personal preferences surprise of course this is isnt an exhaustive list of everything echo dot can do but in retrospect perhaps it shouldnt be surprising that such a remarkable continuously improving device would enjoy such strong demand when its priced at just  and its nothing new to see amazons own products leading the way  around this time last year for example i pointed out that amazoncoms bestselling item in  was none other than its new inch fire tablet which coincidentally shared the same enticing  price point its also difficult to estimate what kind of margins echo dot commands especially given amazon ceo jeff bezos longheld stance that your margin is my opportunity but similar to the ultralowmargin fire tablet last year thats not exactly the point rather most important to the company is that echo dot continues to make amazons ecosystem of products and services that much stickier both by building rapport with consumers and driving incremental sales for its core online retail operations amazon isnt in the habit of providing official revenue or unit sales stats for specific products but given the millions upon millions of items offered on the worlds largest ecommerce destination echo dots status as amazoncoms bestselling

d e shaw  co a wall street firm and moved to seattle washington he began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become amazoncomcitation needed bezos incorporated the company as cadabra inc on july   bezos changed the name to amazoncom inc a few months later after a lawyer misheard its original name as cadaver in september  bezos purchased the url relentlesscom and briefly considered naming his online store relentless but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister the domain is still owned by bezos and still redirects to the retailer the company went online as amazoncom in  bezos selected the name amazon by looking through the dictionary he settled on amazon because it was a place that was exotic and different just as he envisioned for his internet enterprise the amazon

described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the internet business boom during that time in  bezos left his employment as vicepresident of d e shaw  co a wall street firm and moved to seattle washington he began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become amazoncomcitation needed bezos incorporated the company as cadabra inc on july   bezos changed the name to amazoncom inc a few months later after a lawyer misheard its original name as cadaver in september  bezos purchased the url relentlesscom and briefly considered naming his online store relentless but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister the domain is still owned by bezos and still redirects to the retailer the company went online as amazoncom in  bezos selected the name amazon by looking through the dictionary he settled on amazon because it was a place that was exotic and different just as he envisioned for his internet enterprise the amazon river he noted was the biggest river in the world and he planned to make his store the biggest in the world bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand telling a reporter theres nothing about our model that cant be copied over time but you know mcdonalds got copied and it still built a huge multibilliondollar company a lot of it comes down to the brand name brand names are more important online than they

which included compact discs computer hardware computer software videos and books bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online due to the large worldwide demand for literature the low price points for books along with the huge number of titles available in print amazon was founded in the garage of bezos home in bellevue washington the company began as an online bookstore

become a huge player in online sales the company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of   million ie ¢ per share on revenues of more than  billion this profit margin though extremely

such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales for competitive reasons amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public however amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the nielsen bookscan service to verified authors while the asr has been the source of much speculation by publishers manufacturers and marketers amazon itself does not

levied by state and local governments not at the federal level in most countries where amazon operates a sales tax or value added tax is uniform throughout the country and amazon is obliged to collect it from all customers proponents of forcing amazoncom to collect sales tax—at least in states where it maintains a physical presence—argue the corporation wields an anticompetitive advantage over storefront businesses forced to collect sales tax many us states in the st century have passed online shopping sales tax laws designed to compel amazoncom and other ecommerce retailers to collect

relentless but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister the domain is still owned by bezos and still redirects to the retailer the company went online as amazoncom in  bezos selected the name amazon by looking through the dictionary he settled on amazon because it was a place that was exotic and different just as he envisioned for his internet enterprise the amazon river he noted was the

historyedit amazon founder jeff bezos further information timeline of amazoncom the company was founded in  spurred by what amazon founder jeff bezos called his regret minimization framework which described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the internet business boom during that time in  bezos left his employment as vicepresident of d e shaw  co a wall street firm and moved to seattle washington he began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become amazoncomcitation needed bezos incorporated the company as cadabra inc on july   bezos changed the name to amazoncom inc a few months later after a lawyer misheard its original name as cadaver in september  bezos purchased the url relentlesscom and briefly considered naming his online store relentless but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister the domain is still owned by bezos and still redirects to the retailer the company went online as amazoncom in  bezos selected the name amazon by looking through the dictionary he settled on amazon because it was a place that was exotic and different just as he envisioned for his internet enterprise the amazon river he noted was the biggest river in the world and he planned to make his store the biggest in the world bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand telling a reporter theres nothing about our model that cant be copied over time but you know mcdonalds got copied and it still built a huge multibilliondollar company a lot of it comes down to the brand name brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world additionally a name beginning with a was preferential due to the probability it would occur at the top of any list that was alphabetizedcitation needed since june   amazons logotype has featured a curved arrow leading from a to z representing that the company carries every product from a to z with the arrow shaped like a smile after reading a report about the future of the internet that projected annual web commerce growth at  bezos created a list of  products that could be marketed online he narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products which included compact discs computer hardware computer software videos and books bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online due to the large worldwide demand for literature the low price points for books along with the huge number of titles available in print amazon was founded in the garage of bezos home in bellevue washington the company began as an online bookstore which was an idea spurred off with a discussion with john ingram of ingram book now called ingram content group along with keyur patel who still holds a stake in amazon amazon was able to access books

firm and moved to seattle washington he began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become amazoncomcitation needed bezos incorporated the company as cadabra inc on july   bezos changed the name to amazoncom inc a few months later after a lawyer misheard its original name as cadaver in september  bezos purchased the url relentlesscom and briefly considered naming his online store relentless but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister the domain is still owned by bezos and still redirects to the retailer the company went online as amazoncom in  bezos selected the name amazon by looking through the dictionary he settled on amazon because it was a place that was exotic and different just as he envisioned for his internet enterprise the amazon river he noted was the biggest river in the world and he planned to make his store the biggest in the world bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand telling a reporter theres nothing about our model that cant be copied over time but you know mcdonalds got copied and it still built a huge multibilliondollar company a lot of it comes down to the brand name brand names are more important online than they

such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales for competitive reasons amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public however amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the nielsen bookscan service to verified authors while the asr has been the source of much speculation by publishers manufacturers and marketers amazon itself does not

on amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other amazon members these meta sellers may have millions of products listed have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time markup is anywhere from  to  and sometimes more these sellers

levied by state and local governments not at the federal level in most countries where amazon operates a sales tax or value added tax is uniform throughout the country and amazon is obliged to collect it from all customers proponents of forcing amazoncom to collect sales tax—at least in states where it maintains a physical presence—argue the corporation wields an anticompetitive advantage over storefront businesses forced to collect sales tax many us states in the st century have passed online shopping sales tax laws designed to compel amazoncom and other ecommerce retailers to collect

shortly after that report in march  it was reported in the verge that amazon will be removing  months long noncompete clauses from its us employment contracts for hourlypaid workers after criticism

login search search amazoncom incs bestselling product in  hint its not liquid but you can pick up a sixpack at a discount steve symington tmfsymington jan   at pm it seems an understatement to say amazoncom nasdaqamzn had a fantastic  spurred by one spectacular quarter after another shares of the online retail behemoth more than doubled from start to finish last year crushing the sp s modest  gain over the same period amzn data by ycharts of course amazon has yet to release specific financial results for the fourth quarter  though current guidance provided along with last quarters report did suggest investors should expect a record holiday season more specifically revenue is expected to be in the range of  billion to  billion good for growth of  to  over last year we can also safely assume the majority of amazons revenue will continue to come from its core retail business in this crucial period that growth will be collectively driven by the millions upon millions of products across amazons flagship website with that in mind you cant help wondering of all the millions of products available on amazoncom which has enjoyed the greatest demand from consumers  to be clear amazon hasnt released a full list of its most popular products for all of  but if a press release from amazon last week is any indication  and keeping in mind the outsized influence of fourthquarter holiday sales  theres a good chance the no  product on all of amazoncom in  was one of its own making one tablet to rule them allmore specifically amazon just revealed its own hardware devices enjoyed their biggestever holiday season with sales more than doubling over last years recordsetting period  within that group one device clearly stands above the rest in terms of popularity the allnew fire tablet amazons new fire tablet was its most popular item in a recordsetting holiday season credit amazoncom according to amazon the inch fire tablet has been the no  bestselling most wishedfor and mostgifted product across all of amazoncom since its release almost four months ago dont let the fire tablets simple appearance fool you when amazon first introduced the inch device at just  in midseptember it not only boasted of having the best display of any tablet under  but it also claimed to be almost twice as durable as apples latest ipad air as measured in tumble tests while having twice the processing power of samsungs galaxy tab  lite an amazon fire six pack credit amazoncom whats more fire comes with amazon underground giving users access to thousands of paid apps and games at no extra cost it also includes a slew of other amazonexclusive products and services including the kidcentric freetime interface unlimited cloud storage for all amazon content and a new user interface that has garnered wide praise from reviewers and for those ultraefficient holiday shoppers amazon even offers a six pack of fire tablets for just  finally amazon further fueled fires popularity by launching the device in china in early december touting the tablets exclusive features tailored to chinese consumers learning to read english as well as a wide selection of chinese and english content perhaps in retrospect it should come as little surprise that amazons affordable new fire tablet has sold so well playing the long gamethis also raises the question how can amazon possibly make any money selling fire at under  the short answer is that it probably doesnt  at least on the device itself after all amazon has made no mystery of its strategy of sacrificing margins over the near term in favor of grabbing market share and topline growth but in fires case that growth will come not only from revenue generated from the actual sale of the device but also and more significantly through complementary revenue streams from amazonexclusive services like prime amazon instant video and supplementary app store sales but if one thing is sure in the end its that amazon is pleased with fires remarkable rise so far if it manages to continue growing in popularity in the coming year i see no reason amazon stock wont follow suit steve symington owns shares of apple the

juggernaut will post  revenue of roughly  billion good for yearoveryear growth of  i cant help but wonder which of those items was the online retail juggernauts most popular over the last yearperhaps unsurprisingly amazon just confirmed its bestselling product in  was one of its own making the new alexaenabled echo dotamazon echo  buyecho dot  buyecho dots great enableraccording to a recent press release from amazon echo dot is the bestselling most gifted item on amazoncom with millions sold worldwide since launchecho and echo dot were the bestselling products across amazon this year elaborated amazon worldwide consumer ceo jeff wilke and were thrilled that millions of new customers will be introduced to alexa as a result despite our best efforts and rampedup production we still had trouble keeping them in stockin case youre unfamiliar alexa is amazons virtual personal assistant  or as amazon puts it the brain behind echo dot with the help of farfield voicerecognition technology and an array of seven microphones in echo dot  a delightfully small handsfree device that can be placed anywhere in your home  consumers can perform a staggering array of tasks using only voice commands such as playing music ordering a pizza requesting virtually any information calling a ride from uber controlling compatible smarthome devices and of course ordering items from amazoncombecause alexa is a cloudbased service amazon can also make it smarter automatically adding new features without requiring any action from consumers over time alexa even adapts to users speech patterns vocabulary and personal preferencessurpriseof course this is isnt an exhaustive list of everything echo dot can do but in retrospect perhaps it shouldnt be surprising that such a remarkable continuously improving device would enjoy such strong demand when its priced at just  and its nothing new to see amazons own products leading the way  around this time last year for example i pointed out that amazoncoms bestselling item in  was none other than its new inch fire tablet which coincidentally shared the same enticing  price pointits also difficult to estimate what kind of margins echo dot commands especially given amazon ceo jeff bezos longheld stance that your margin is my opportunity but similar to the ultralowmargin fire tablet last year thats not exactly the point rather most important to the company is that echo dot continues to make amazons ecosystem of products and services that much stickier both by building rapport with consumers and driving incremental sales for its core online retail operationsamazon isnt in the habit of providing official revenue or unit sales stats for specific products but given the millions upon millions of items offered on the worlds largest ecommerce destination echo dots status as amazoncoms bestselling product of  is no small feat stocks we like better than amazoncom when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock

amazon founder jeff bezos called his regret minimization framework which described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the internet business boom during that time in  bezos left his employment as vicepresident of d e shaw  co a wall street firm and moved to seattle washington he began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become amazoncomcitation needed bezos incorporated the company as cadabra inc on july   bezos changed the name to amazoncom inc a few months later after a lawyer misheard its original name as cadaver in september  bezos purchased the url relentlesscom and briefly considered naming his online store relentless but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister the domain is still owned by bezos and still redirects to the retailer the company went online as amazoncom in  bezos selected the name amazon by looking through the dictionary he settled on amazon because it was a place that was exotic and different just as he envisioned for his internet enterprise the amazon river he noted was the biggest river in the world and he planned to make his store the biggest in the world bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand telling a reporter theres nothing about our model that cant be copied over time but you know mcdonalds got copied and it still built a huge multibilliondollar company a lot of it comes down to the brand name brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world additionally a name beginning with a was preferential due to the probability it would occur at the top of any list that was alphabetizedcitation needed since june   amazons logotype has featured a curved arrow leading from a to z representing that the company carries every product from a to z with the arrow shaped like a smile after reading a report about the future of the internet that projected annual web commerce growth at  bezos created a list of  products that could be marketed online he narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products which included compact discs computer hardware computer software videos and books bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online due to the large worldwide demand for literature the low price points for books along with the huge number of titles available in print amazon was founded in the garage of bezos home in bellevue washington the company began as an online bookstore which was an idea spurred off with a discussion with john ingram of ingram book now called ingram content group along with keyur patel who still holds a stake in amazon amazon was able to access books at wholesale from ingram in the first two months of business amazon sold to all  states and over  countries within two months amazons sales were up to week while the largest brick and mortar bookstores and mail order catalogs might offer  titles an online bookstore could carry several times more since it

three stock splits in the late scitation needed amazons initial business plan was unusual it did not expect to make a profit for four to five years this slow growth caused stockholders to complain that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the longterm when the dotcom bubble burst at the start of the st century and destroyed many ecompanies in the process amazon survived and grew on past the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales the company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of   million ie ¢ per share on revenues of more than  billion this profit margin though extremely modest proved to skeptics that bezos unconventional business model could succeed in  time magazine named bezos the

bookstore was false because of it  isnt a bookstore at all its a book broker the suit was later settled out of court and amazon continued to make the same claim walmart sued amazon on october

company was founded in  spurred by what amazon founder jeff bezos called his regret minimization framework which described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the internet business boom during that time in  bezos left his employment as vicepresident of d e shaw  co a wall street firm and moved to seattle washington he began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become amazoncomcitation needed bezos incorporated the company as cadabra inc on july   bezos changed the name to amazoncom inc a few months later after a lawyer misheard its original name as cadaver in september  bezos purchased the url relentlesscom and briefly considered naming his online store relentless but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister the domain is still owned by bezos and still redirects to the retailer the company went online as amazoncom in  bezos selected the name amazon by looking through the dictionary he settled on amazon because it was a place that was exotic and different just as he envisioned for his internet enterprise the amazon river he noted was the biggest river in the world and he planned to make his store the biggest in the world bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand telling a reporter theres nothing about our model that cant be copied over time but you know mcdonalds got copied and it still built a huge multibilliondollar company a lot of it comes down to the brand name brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world additionally a name beginning with a was preferential due

print amazon was founded in the garage of bezos home in bellevue washington the company began as an online bookstore which was an idea spurred off with a discussion with john ingram of ingram book now

millions of products stocked by amazon while the asr has no direct effect on the sales of a product it is used by amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales in particular products that experience large jumps up or down in their sales ranks may be included within amazons lists of movers and shakers such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales for competitive reasons amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public however amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the nielsen bookscan service to verified authors while the asr has been the source of much speculation by

drop shippers or meta sellers these are members or entities that advertise goods on amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other amazon members these meta sellers may have millions of products listed have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
