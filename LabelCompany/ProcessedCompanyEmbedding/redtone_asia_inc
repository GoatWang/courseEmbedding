other things b cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents c accounts receivable and other receivables trade receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts an estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable   d property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to the statement of operations as incurred whereas significant renewals and improvements are capitalized the cost and the related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations the company provides for depreciation of property plant and equipment principally by use of the

base are amortized on a straightline basis over  years the company performs regular review of identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than the original company policies if such facts and circumstances exist the company regularly assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets if the useful life is shorter than originally estimated we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life amortization expense attributable to the operations for the three month period ended july   and  amounted to  and  respectively f availableforsale investments investments in equity securities that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are recognized in the balance sheet at cost less impairment losses g accounting for the impairment of longlived assets the longlived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes determination of recoverability of assets to be held and used is by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell there is no impairment loss recognized during the three months ended july   and  h income tax income taxes are based on pretax financial accounting income deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts the company periodically assesses the need to establish valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets to the extent the company no longer believes it is more likely than not that the tax assets will be fully utilized the company evaluates a tax position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize and the appropriate reserve to establish if any if a tax position does not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold no benefit is recognized   i fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date to increase the comparability of fair value measures the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value   level —valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets   level —valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data   level —valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants these valuations require significant judgment  we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities all other financial instruments were valued based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data j revenue recognition the company assesses appropriate revenue recognition policy for each type of operation according

call services for end users and corporate segment and paperless reload services for prepaid mobile airtime reload for end users in shanghai covering all three major telecommunication operators namely china mobile china unicom and china telecom   critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenues and expenses amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements   we believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements we suggest that our significant accounting policies as described in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the summary of significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company has adopted a revenue recognition policy for each type of operation according to asc  revenue represents the invoiced value of services rendered and receivable during the year revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met  • persuasive evidence an arrangement exists • delivery has occurred or services have been rendered • the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and • collectability is reasonably assured revenue

first three months of the fiscal year ending april    representing a  decrease as compared with the preceding years corresponding quarters the decrease in revenues was mainly due to lower consumption from the competitive market of  other income and gains    during the first three  month period of the fiscal year ending april    the company recorded other income and gains of  a decrease of   or   compared with the preceding years corresponding quarter the decrease was due to a decrease in interest income from time deposits service cost service costs from operations for the first three months in fiscal year  of  reflected a decrease of  or  over the preceding year quarter ended april   the decrease in service costs was mainly due to decrease in the traffic consumption personnel expenses   the personnel expenses have decreased by   or   to  for the first three months of the fiscal year ending april   the decrease is due to reduction in manpower due to business operation is on reducing trend depreciation and amortization expenses the decrease in depreciation expense by  or  is mainly due to the impairment of the properties plant and equipment since the previous quarter of fiscal year  amortization expense is generally comparable to the corresponding period of last fiscal year administrative and other operating expenses    during the first three months of the fiscal year ending april    the company recorded general and administrative expenses of  a marginal decrease of   or   compared with the preceding years corresponding quarter loss profit before provision for income taxes    for the quarter under review the decrease in revenues has caused the net loss before provision for income taxes to be  as compared to a gain of  over the preceding years corresponding quarter   income tax expense   for the current quarter under review there is an income tax expense of  compared to income tax expense of  over the preceding quarters corresponding quarter  net loss before noncontrolling interest   for the quarter under review the dramatic drop of revenue has caused the net loss before noncontrolling interest to be  as compared to a marginal loss of  over the preceding years corresponding quarter   liquidity and capital resources cash   our cash balance at july   was  representing a decrease of  compared to our cash balance of    at april   cash flow

  amounted to  as compared to net cash provided by operations of  in the same period of fy the net cash used in the operating activities during the quarter under review mainly due to tight competition in prc telecommunication industry net cash provided by investing activities for the three months period ended july   amounted to  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  in the same period of fy the net cash provided during the quarter is mainly due to decrease in placement in the short term trust fund there was net cash used in financing activities of  for the three months ended july   working capital   we have negative working capital of  at july   at july   we had stockholders equity of    total assets of  and total current liabilities of    we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for our existing operations we do not currently anticipate purchasing or leasing any plant and equipment during approximately the next twelve  months we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations however there can be no assurances that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future we have no off balance sheet arrangements  item    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are exposed to various market risks arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as foreign exchange fluctuations and interest rates which could impact our results of operations and financial position we do not currently engage in any hedging or other market risk management tools and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes   foreign currency exchange rate risk   fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies in chinese renminbi rmb malaysian ringgit rm and hong kong dollar hk could adversely affect our financial results we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our sales in the future selling marketing and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currency thereby mitigating our transaction risk exposure we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial however for sales not denominated in us dollars if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase in such cases and if we price our products in the foreign currency we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our price not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency all of our sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are denominated in the rmb rm and hk our principal exchange rate risk therefore exists between the us dollar and these currencies fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the remeasurement of our foreign currencydenominated receivables and payables generating currency transaction gains or losses that impact our nonoperating incomeexpense levels in the respective period and are reported in other income expense net in our combined consolidated financial statements we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we may however hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future interest rate risk changes in interest rates may affect the interest paid or earned and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations however we do not believe that this interest rate change risk is significant   inflation   inflation has not had a material impact on the companys business in recent years   currency exchange fluctuations   the companys revenues and its expenses are denominated in rmb rm and hk the value of these foreign currencytous dollars may fluctuate and is affected by among other things changes in political and economic conditions since  the conversion of rmb into foreign currencies including us dollars has been based on rates set by the peoples bank of china which are set daily based on the previous days interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets since  the official exchange rate for the conversion of rmb to us dollars had generally been stable and rmb had appreciated slightly against the us dollar however on july   the chinese government changed its policy of pegging the value of rmb to the us dollar under the new policy rmb may fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies recently there has been increased political pressure on the chinese government to decouple the rmb from the united states dollar at the recent quarterly regular meeting of peoples bank of china its currency policy committee affirmed the effects of the reform on rmb exchange rate since february  the new currency rate system has been operated the currency rate of rmb has become more flexible while basically maintaining stable and the expectation for a larger appreciation range is shrinking the company has never engaged in currency hedging operations and has no present intention to do so   concentration of credit risk   credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted concentrations of credit risk whether on or off balance sheet that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions as described below    the companys business is characterized by new product and service development and evolving industry standards and regulations inherent in the companys business are various risks and uncertainties including the impact from the volatility of the stock market limited operating history uncertain profitability and the ability to raise additional capital  the companys revenue is deriving from china and hong kong changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation or the imposition of confiscatory taxation restrictions on currency conversion devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition     if the company is unable to derive any revenues from these countries it would have a significant financially disruptive effect on the normal operations of the company item t   control and procedures a evaluation of disclosure controls
