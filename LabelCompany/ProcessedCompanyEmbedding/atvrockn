a contract manufacturer to make the unit for us we had no material agreement with our contract manufacturer other than we pay them to produce product for us based on our needs as we are undercapitalized we were unable to produce the required housing moldings we believe would best sell in the atvutv aftermarket   overview   management is currently seeking new business opportunities referred by various sources including its officerdirector professional advisors venture capitalists members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals   we will seek businesses from all known sources but will rely principally on personal contacts of the officerdirector and his affiliates as well as indirect associations between him and other business and professional people   we will not restrict our search to any particular business industry or geographical location and management reserves the right to evaluate and enter into any type of business in any location it may participate in a newly organized business venture on the other hand we may select a more established company entering a new phase of growth or in need of additional capital to overcome existing financial problems   in seeking a business venture the decision of management will not be controlled by an attempt to take advantage of any anticipated or perceived appeal of a specific industry management group product or industry but will be based on the business objective of seeking longterm capital appreciation in the real value for atvrockn   the period within which we may participate in a business on completion of this offering cannot be predicted and will depend on circumstances beyond our control including the availability of businesses the time required to complete our investigation and analysis of prospective businesses the time required to prepare appropriate documents and agreements providing for our participation and other circumstances it is anticipated that the analysis of specific proposals and the selection of a business will take several months   it is possible that we may propose to acquire a business in the development stage a business is in the development stage if it is devoting most of its efforts to establishing a new business and planned principal operations have either not commenced or not yet resulted in significant revenues            competition   we will be involved in intense competition with other business entities many of which will have a competitive edge over us by virtue of their more substantial financial resources and prior experience in business we also face numerous other smaller companies at the same stage of development as we are     patents trademarks and licenses   we do not have any trademarks patents or other intellectual property   based on the nature of our business we do not expect to file any trademarks or patents     properties   the companys corporate headquarters are

arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations   therefore management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating and capital requirements of the company while the company is devoting its best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations these conditions raise

atvrockn had total current liabilities of    the company has limited financial resources available which has had an adverse impact on the companys liquidity activities and operations these limitations have adversely affected the companys ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business without realization of additional capital it would be unlikely for the company to continue as a going concern management intends to raise additional debt or equity financing to fund ongoing operations and necessary working capital however there is no assurance that such financing plans will be successful or be obtained in amounts sufficient to meet the company’s needs   notwithstanding atvrockn anticipates generating losses and therefore may be unable to continue operations in the future atvrockn anticipates it will require additional capital in order to develop its business atvrockn may use a combination of equity andor debt instruments to funds its growth strategy or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party                    management is currently exploring various business strategies to help the companys business this includes evaluating various options and strategies the analysis of new business opportunities and evaluating new business strategies will be undertaken by the companys management in analyzing prospective businesses opportunities the company will consider to the extent applicable the available technical financial and managerial resources of any given business venture part of the evaluation will also consider the nature of present and expected competition the potential for growth and expansion the likelihood of sustaining a profit within given time frames the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products services trade or service marks name identification and other relevant factors   the company anticipates that the results of operations of a specific business venture may not necessarily be indicative of the potential

procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and de under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act

rules and forms adopted by the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief accounting officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures   management with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief accounting officer who is also the sole member of our board of directors has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this form q based on such evaluation the chief executive officer and the chief accounting officer concluded that as of february   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses described below under managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting which are in the process of being remediated as described below under management plan to remediate material weaknesses   managements report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules promulgated under the exchange act is a process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer and affected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that   · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets   · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our board of directors and   · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements  because of its inherent limitations a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk further over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of february   in making its assessment management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on its assessment management has concluded that we had certain control deficiencies described below that constituted material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as a result our internal controls over financial reporting was not effective as of february     a material weakness is defined under sec rules as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls as a result of managements review of the investigation issues and results and other internal reviews and evaluations that were completed after the end of the quarter ending february   related to the preparation of managements report on internal controls over financial reporting required for this quarterly report on form q management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following    lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures and    insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements   we do not believe the material weaknesses described above caused any meaningful or significant misreporting of our financial condition and results of operations for the period ended february   however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods    management plan to remediate material weaknesses   management is pursuing the implementation of corrective measures to address the material weaknesses described below in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures   we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us additionally we will create written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements   we believe the remediation measures described above will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting we are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to diligently and vigorously review our financial reporting controls and procedures as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting we may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify or in appropriate circumstances not to complete certain of the remediation measures described above   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules af and df of the exchange act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   in may  coso released an updated version of its internal control  integrated framework  framework initially issued in  the original framework  framework provided guidance to organizations to design implement and evaluate the effectiveness of internal control concepts and simplify their use and application the  framework is
