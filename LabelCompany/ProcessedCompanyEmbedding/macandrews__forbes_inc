originally operated as a single entity named first texas bank but the name changed to first gibraltar after about a week perelmans turnaround manifested as trimming the payroll selling branches and dumping of  billion of underperforming assets in  perelman added san antonio savings association and sooner federal to first gibraltar for  million and  million respectively the purchase of san antonio added  billion of healthy assets  billion unhealthy assets and a  billion government cash advance to perelmans larder while sooner only provided  billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees sooner federal was not only the last sl perelman bought but the first he sold in august  he sold the pieces of sooner to bank of oklahoma and fourth financial corporation for  million the following month he sold the rest of first gibraltar to bankamerica for  million retaining four branches in plano texas and  billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors he renamed the four branches first madison its unclear how much money perelman made from his savings  loan deals but its estimated that he made anywhere from  million to  billion with most of the profits manifesting as tax breaks elsewhere in his empire in essence by owning first gibraltar he was able to avoid paying hundreds of millions in federal taxes perelman jumped back into the savings  loan game in a big way in  by buying first nationwide from the ford motor company for  million ford held onto  billion of first nationwides assets valued at  million twothirds of which were considered troubled assets offered to buy back up to  million of first nationwides other  billion of assets that went bad in the future and gave perelman  million to cover potential severance payments

collective sffeds  billion of assets for  million and home federal financials  million of assets and  million of deposits for  million just as quickly as he added assets branches and deposits in california he dumped what he had elsewhere in the country in  alone he sold off  branches with  billion in deposits spread out across five states  went a little slower but not eventfully he acquired california federal bancorp for  billion creating the th largest thrift in the country with  billion in assets in  another  billion in mortgages were added courtesy of wmc mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for first nationwide in  perelman negotiated a stock swap with golden state bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with  billion of assets the deal left golden states shareholders the majority but perelmans camp still controlled the company everything remained quiet until may  when citigroup announced plans to buy golden state for  billion but ultimately reduced the offer to  billion due to a stock drop citigroups final offer was  shares of citigroup common stock and  cash for every share of golden state exchanged which converted perelmans  million shares of golden state into  in cash plus  shares of citigroup all things considered perelman expected to make about  billion off the deal but because he had quasisold many of his shares in the past he probably gained substantially less than that andrews groupedit andrews group inc is formed from the corporate shell of the former compact video andrews group purchases marvel entertainment group

stanley perelman sold his entire stake  in coleman to al dunlap in exchange for  billion in cash and  million of sunbeam stock they completed the deal on march  despite a selloff triggering press release from march  that said sunbeam would not meet sales expectations on april  another press release took sunbeams stock from bad to worse it would not only fall short of sales expectations for that quarter but it would barely meet the sales expectations of two years ago the stock went into a tail spin falling from  a share to  a share in a matter of weeks and continued its downward spiral in the following weeks perelman bought control of sunbeam in an effort to salvage the situation but it was for naught the company had to file for bankruptcy within three years morgan stanleyedit on february   perelman filed a lawsuit against morgan stanley two facts were at issue did morgan stanley know about the problems with sunbeam and was ronald perelman misled during the discovery phase the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of morgan stanley and ordered the jury to assume morgan stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded perelman hobbled morgan stanley had no choice but to argue that perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks after a fiveweek trial the jury deliberated for two days found in favor of perelman and awarded him  billion the damages stung particularly because morgan stanley passed up perelmans offer to settle the case for  million morgan stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided citing the judges decision to use florida law over new york law and her decision to order the jury to consider morgan stanley guilty before the trial began in  the courts of appeal reversed the judgement the judges declared perelman hadnt provided any evidence showing hed suffered any actual damage as a result of morgan stanleys actions perelman appealed but found himself shot down by the florida supreme court who dismissed it in a – decision undeterred even after that setback perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was a classic example of fraud on the court the trial court rejected his arguments but as of january  he is beseeching floridas th circuit to reopen the case spacedit in

as the savings  loan crisis in  when along with gerald j ford he bought five insolvent thrifts with  billion in assets and  billion in federal aid for  million the five banks originally operated as a single entity named first texas bank but the name changed to first gibraltar after about a week perelmans turnaround manifested as trimming the payroll selling branches and dumping of  billion of underperforming assets in  perelman added san antonio savings association and sooner federal to first gibraltar for  million and  million respectively the purchase of san antonio added  billion of healthy assets  billion unhealthy assets and a  billion government cash advance to perelmans larder while sooner only provided  billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees sooner federal was not only the last sl perelman bought but the first he sold in august  he sold the pieces of sooner to bank of oklahoma and fourth financial corporation for  million the following month he sold the rest of first gibraltar to bankamerica for  million retaining four branches in plano texas and  billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors he renamed the four branches first madison its unclear how much money perelman made from his savings  loan deals but its estimated that he made anywhere from  million to  billion with most of the profits manifesting as tax breaks elsewhere in his empire in essence by owning first gibraltar he was able to avoid paying hundreds of millions in federal taxes perelman jumped back into the savings  loan game in a big way in  by buying first nationwide from the ford motor company for  million ford held onto  billion of first nationwides assets valued at  million twothirds of which were considered troubled assets offered to buy back up to  million of first nationwides other  billion of assets that went bad in the future and gave perelman  million to cover potential severance payments perelman quickly boosted its portfolio adding  billion worth of mortgages in exchange for a  million payment to resolution trust corporation before  ended perelman added two more thrifts to his collective sffeds  billion of assets for  million and home federal financials  million of assets and  million of deposits for  million just as quickly as he added assets branches and deposits in california he dumped what he had elsewhere in the country in  alone he sold off  branches with  billion in deposits spread out across five states  went a little slower but not eventfully he acquired california federal bancorp for  billion creating the th largest thrift in the country with  billion in assets in  another  billion in mortgages were added courtesy of wmc mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for first nationwide in  perelman negotiated a stock swap with golden state bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with  billion of assets the deal left golden states shareholders the majority but perelmans camp still controlled the company everything remained quiet until may  when citigroup announced plans to buy golden state for  billion but ultimately reduced the offer to  billion due to a stock drop citigroups final offer was  shares of citigroup common stock and  cash for every share of golden state exchanged which converted perelmans  million shares of golden state into  in cash plus  shares of citigroup all things considered perelman expected to make about  billion off the deal but because he had quasisold many of his shares in the past he probably gained

slate meagher  flom for appellee before mcneilly and moore jj and balick judge sitting by designation pursuant to del const art iv §   moore justice in this battle for corporate control of revlon inc revlon the court of chancery enjoined certain transactions designed to thwart the efforts of pantry pride inc pantry pride to acquire revlon the defendants are revlon its board of directors and forstmann little  co and the latters affiliated limited partnership collectively forstmann the injunction barred consummation of an option granted forstmann to purchase certain revlon assets the lockup option a promise by revlon to deal exclusively with forstmann in the face of a takeover the noshop provision and the payment of a  million cancellation fee to forstmann if the transaction was aborted the court of chancery found that the revlon directors had breached their duty of care by entering into the foregoing transactions  and effectively ending an active auction for the company the trial court ruled that such arrangements are not illegal per se under delaware law but that their use under the circumstances here was impermissible we agree see macandrews  forbes holdings inc v revlon inc del ch  ad   thus we granted this expedited interlocutory appeal to consider for the first time the validity of such defensive measures in the face of an active bidding contest for corporate control additionally we address for the first time the extent to which a corporation may consider the impact of a takeover threat on constituencies other than shareholders see unocal corp v mesa petroleum co delsupr  ad    in our view lockups and related agreements are permitted under delaware law where their adoption is untainted by director interest or other breaches of fiduciary duty the actions taken by the revlon directors however did not meet this standard moreover while concern for various corporate constituencies is proper when addressing a takeover threat that principle is limited by the requirement that there be some rationally related benefit accruing to the stockholders we find no such benefit here thus under all the circumstances we must agree with the court of chancery that the enjoined revlon defensive measures were inconsistent with the directors duties to the stockholders accordingly we affirm i the somewhat complex maneuvers of the parties necessitate a rather detailed examination of the facts the prelude to this controversy began in june  when ronald o perelman chairman of the board and chief executive officer of pantry pride met with his counterpart at revlon michel c bergerac to discuss a friendly acquisition of revlon by pantry pride perelman suggested a price in the range of  per share but the meeting ended with bergerac dismissing those figures as considerably below revlons intrinsic value all subsequent pantry pride overtures were rebuffed perhaps in part based on mr bergeracs strong personal antipathy to mr perelman thus on august  pantry prides board authorized perelman to acquire revlon either through negotiation in the  per share range or by making a hostile tender offer at  perelman then met with bergerac and outlined pantry prides alternate approaches bergerac remained adamantly opposed to such schemes and conditioned any further discussions of the matter on pantry pride executing a standstill agreement prohibiting it from acquiring revlon without the latters prior approval on august  the revlon board met specially to consider the impending threat of a hostile bid by pantry pride at the meeting lazard freres revlons investment  banker advised the directors that  per share was a grossly inadequate price for the company felix rohatyn and william loomis of lazard freres explained to the board that pantry prides financial strategy for acquiring revlon would be through junk bond financing followed by a breakup of revlon and the disposition of its assets with proper timing according to the experts such transactions could produce a return to pantry pride of  to  per share while a sale of the company as a whole would be in the mid  dollar range martin lipton special counsel for revlon recommended two defensive measures first that the company repurchase up to  million of its nearly  million outstanding shares and second that it adopt a note purchase rights plan under this plan each revlon shareholder would receive as a dividend one note purchase right the rights for each share of common stock with the rights entitling the holder to exchange one common share for a  principal revlon note at  interest with a oneyear maturity the rights would become effective whenever anyone acquired beneficial ownership of  or more of revlons shares unless the purchaser acquired all the companys stock for cash at  or more per share in addition the rights would not be available to the acquiror and prior to the  triggering event the revlon board could redeem the rights for  cents each both proposals were unanimously adopted pantry pride made its first hostile move on august  with a cash tender offer for any and all shares of revlon at  per common share and  per preferred share subject to  pantry prides obtaining financing for the purchase and  the rights being redeemed rescinded or voided the revlon board met again on august  the directors advised the stockholders to reject the offer further defensive measures also were planned on august  revlon commenced its own offer for up to  million shares exchanging for each share of common stock tendered one senior subordinated note the notes of  principal at  interest due  and onetenth of a share of  cumulative convertible exchangeable preferred stock valued at  per share lazard freres opined that the notes would trade at their face value on a fully distributed basis revlon stockholders tendered  percent of the outstanding shares approximately  million and the company accepted the full  million shares on a pro rata basis the new notes contained covenants which limited revlons ability to incur additional debt sell assets or pay dividends unless otherwise approved by the independent nonmanagement members of the board at this point both the rights and the note covenants stymied pantry prides attempted takeover the next move came on september  when pantry pride announced a new tender offer at  per share conditioned upon receiving at least  of the outstanding stock pantry pride also indicated that it would consider buying less than  and at an increased price if revlon removed the impeding rights while this offer was lower on its face than the earlier  proposal revlons investment banker lazard freres described the two bids as essentially equal in view of the completed exchange offer the revlon board held a regularly scheduled meeting on september  the directors rejected the latest pantry pride offer and authorized management to negotiate with other parties interested in acquiring revlon pantry pride remained determined in its efforts and continued to make cash bids for the company offering  per share on september  and raising its bid to  on october  and then to  on october   in the meantime revlons negotiations with forstmann and the investment group adler  shaykin had produced results the revlon directors met on october  to consider pantry prides  bid and to examine possible alternatives to the offer both forstmann and adler  shaykin made certain proposals to the board as a result the directors unanimously agreed to a leveraged buyout by forstmann the terms of this accord were as follows each stockholder would get  cash per share management would purchase stock in the new company by the exercise of their revlon golden parachutes forstmann would assume revlons  million debt incurred by the issuance of the notes and revlon would redeem the rights and waive the notes covenants for forstmann or in connection with any other offer superior to forstmanns the board did not actually remove the covenants at the october  meeting because forstmann then lacked a firm commitment on its financing but accepted the forstmann capital structure and indicated that the outside directors would waive the covenants in due course part of forstmanns plan was to sell revlons norcliff thayer and reheis divisions to american home products for  million before the merger revlon was to sell its cosmetics and fragrance division to adler  shaykin for  million these transactions would facilitate the purchase by forstmann or any other acquiror of revlon when the merger and thus the waiver of the notes covenants was announced the market value of these securities began to fall the notes which originally traded near par around  dropped to  by october  one director later reported at the october  meeting a deluge of telephone calls from irate noteholders and on october  the wall street journal reported threats of litigation by these creditors pantry pride countered with a new proposal on october  raising its  offer to  subject to nullification of the rights a waiver of the notes covenants and the election of three pantry pride directors to the revlon board on october  representatives of pantry pride forstmann and revlon conferred in an attempt to negotiate the fate of revlon but could not reach agreement at this meeting pantry pride announced that it would engage in fractional bidding and top any forstmann offer by a slightly higher one it is also significant that forstmann to pantry prides exclusion had been made privy to certain revlon financial data thus the parties were not negotiating on equal terms again privately armed with revlon data forstmann met on october  with revlons special counsel and investment banker on october  forstmann made a new  per share offer based on several conditions the principal demand was a lockup option to purchase revlons vision care and national health laboratories divisions for  million some  million below the value ascribed to them by lazard freres if another acquiror got  of revlons shares revlon also was required to accept a noshop provision the rights and notes covenants had to be removed as in the october  agreement there would be a  million cancellation fee to be placed in escrow and released to forstmann if the new agreement terminated or if another acquiror got more than  of revlons stock finally there would be no participation by revlon management in the merger in return forstmann agreed to support the par value  of the notes which had faltered in the market by an exchange of new notes forstmann also demanded immediate acceptance of its offer or it would be withdrawn the board unanimously approved forstmanns proposal because  it was for a higher price than the pantry pride bid  it protected the noteholders and  forstmanns financing was firmly in place the board further agreed to redeem the rights and waive the covenants on the preferred stock in response to any offer above  cash per share the covenants were waived contingent upon receipt of an investment banking opinion that the notes would trade near par value once the offer was consummated pantry pride which had initially sought injunctive relief from the rights plan on august  filed an amended complaint on october  challenging the lockup the cancellation fee and the exercise of the rights and the notes covenants pantry pride also sought a temporary restraining order to prevent revlon from placing any assets in escrow or transferring them to forstmann moreover on october  pantry pride again raised its bid with a cash offer of  per share conditioned upon nullification of the rights waiver of the covenants and an injunction of the forstmann lockup on october  the court of chancery prohibited the further transfer of assets and eight days later enjoined the lockup noshop and cancellation fee provisions of the agreement the trial court concluded that the revlon directors had breached their duty of loyalty by making concessions to forstmann out of concern for their liability to the noteholders rather than maximizing the sale price of the company for the stockholders benefit macandrews  forbes holdings inc v revlon inc  ad at  ii to obtain a preliminary injunction a plaintiff must demonstrate both a reasonable probability of success on the merits and some irreparable harm which will occur absent the injunction gimbel v signal companies delch  ad    affd delsupr  ad   additionally the court shall balance the conveniences of and possible injuries to the parties id a we turn first to pantry prides probability of success on the merits the ultimate responsibility for managing the business and affairs of a corporation falls on its board of directors  delc § a in discharging this function the directors owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the corporation and its shareholders guth v loft inc  delsupr   ad    aronson v lewis delsupr  ad    these principles apply with equal force when a board approves a corporate merger pursuant to  delc § b smith v van gorkom delsupr  ad    and of course they are the bedrock of our law regarding corporate takeover issues pogostin v rice delsupr  ad    unocal corp v mesa  petroleum co delsupr  ad     moran v household international inc delsupr  ad    while the business judgment rule may be applicable to the actions of corporate directors responding to takeover threats the principles upon which it is founded — care loyalty and independence — must first be satisfied aronson v lewis  ad at  if the business judgment rule applies there is a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company aronson v lewis  ad at  however when a board implements antitakeover measures there arises the omnipresent specter that a board may be acting primarily in its own interests rather than those of the corporation and its shareholders  unocal corp v mesa petroleum co  ad at  this potential for conflict places upon the directors the burden of proving that they had reasonable grounds for believing there was a danger to corporate policy and effectiveness a burden satisfied by a showing of good faith and reasonable investigation id at  in addition the directors must analyze the nature of the takeover and its effect on the corporation in order to ensure balance — that the responsive action taken is reasonable in relation to the threat posed id b the first relevant defensive measure adopted by the revlon board was the rights plan which would be considered a poison pill in the current language of corporate takeovers — a plan by which shareholders receive the right to be bought out by the corporation at a substantial premium on the occurrence of a stated triggering event see generally moran v household international inc delsupr  ad   by  delc §§  and  the board clearly had the power to adopt the measure see moran v household international inc  ad at  thus the focus becomes one of reasonableness and purpose the revlon board approved the rights plan in the face of an impending hostile takeover bid by pantry pride at  per share a price which revlon reasonably concluded was grossly inadequate lazard freres had so advised the directors and had also informed them that pantry pride was a small highly leveraged company bent on a bustup takeover by using junk bond financing to buy revlon cheaply sell the acquired assets to pay the  debts incurred and retain the profit for itself in adopting the plan the board protected the shareholders from a hostile takeover at a price below the companys intrinsic value while retaining sufficient flexibility to address any proposal deemed to be in the stockholders best interests to that extent the board acted in good faith and upon reasonable investigation under the circumstances it cannot be said that the rights plan as employed was unreasonable considering the threat posed indeed the plan was a factor in causing pantry pride to raise its bids from a low of  to an eventual high of  at the time of its adoption the rights plan afforded a measure of protection consistent with the directors fiduciary duty in facing a takeover threat perceived as detrimental to corporate interests unocal  ad at  far from being a showstopper as the plaintiffs had contended in moran the measure spurred the bidding to new heights a proper result of its implementation see moran  ad at   although we consider adoption of the plan to have been valid under the circumstances its continued usefulness was rendered moot by the directors actions on october  and october  at the october  meeting the board redeemed the rights conditioned upon consummation of a merger with forstmann but further acknowledged that they would also be redeemed to facilitate any more favorable offer on october  the board unanimously passed a resolution redeeming the rights in connection with any cash proposal of  or more per share because all the pertinent offers eventually equalled or surpassed that amount the rights clearly were no longer any impediment in the contest for revlon this mooted any question of their propriety under moran or unocal c the second defensive measure adopted by revlon to thwart a pantry pride takeover was the companys own exchange offer for  million of its shares the directors general broad powers to manage the business and affairs of the corporation are augmented by the specific authority conferred under  delc § a permitting the company to deal in its own stock unocal  ad at  cheff v mathes  delsupr   ad    kors v carey  delch   ad    however when exercising that power in an effort to forestall a hostile takeover the boards actions are strictly held to the fiduciary standards outlined in unocal these standards require the directors to determine the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders and impose an enhanced duty to abjure any action that is motivated by considerations other than a good faith concern for such interests unocal  ad at  see bennett v propp  delsupr   ad    the revlon directors concluded that pantry prides  offer was grossly inadequate in that regard the board acted in good faith and on an informed basis with reasonable grounds to believe that there existed a harmful threat to the corporate enterprise the adoption of a defensive measure reasonable in relation to the threat posed was proper and fully accorded with the powers duties and responsibilities conferred upon directors under our law unocal  ad at  pogostin v rice  ad at   d however when pantry pride increased its offer to  per share and then to  it became apparent to all that the breakup of the company was inevitable the revlon boards authorization permitting management to negotiate a merger or buyout with a third party was a recognition that the company was for sale the duty of the board had thus changed from the preservation of revlon as a corporate entity to the maximization of the companys value at a sale for the stockholders benefit this significantly altered the boards responsibilities under the unocal standards it no longer faced threats to corporate policy and effectiveness or to the stockholders interests from a grossly inadequate bid the whole question of defensive measures became moot the directors role changed from defenders of the corporate bastion to auctioneers charged with getting the best price for the stockholders at a sale of the company iii this brings us to the lockup with forstmann and its emphasis on shoring up the sagging market value of the notes in the face of threatened litigation by their holders such a focus was inconsistent with the changed concept of the directors responsibilities at this stage of the developments the impending waiver of the notes covenants had caused the value of the notes to fall and the board was aware of the noteholders ire as well as their subsequent threats of suit the directors thus made support of the notes an integral part of the companys dealings with forstmann even though their primary responsibility at this stage was to the equity owners the original threat posed by pantry pride — the breakup of the company — had become a reality which even the directors embraced selective dealing to fend off a hostile but determined bidder was no longer a proper objective instead obtaining the highest price for the benefit of the stockholders should have been the central theme guiding director action thus the revlon board could not make the requisite showing of good faith by preferring the noteholders and ignoring its duty of loyalty to the shareholders the rights of the former already were fixed by contract wolfensohn v madison fund inc delsupr  ad    harff v kerkorian delch  ad   the noteholders required no further protection and when the revlon board entered into an auctionending lockup agreement with forstmann on the basis of impermissible considerations at the expense of the shareholders the directors breached their primary duty of loyalty the revlon board argued that it acted in good faith in protecting the noteholders because unocal permits consideration of other corporate constituencies although such considerations may be permissible there are fundamental limitations upon that prerogative a board may have regard for various constituencies in discharging its responsibilities provided there are rationally related benefits accruing to the stockholders unocal  ad at  however such concern for nonstockholder interests is inappropriate when an auction among active bidders is in progress and the object no longer is to protect or maintain the corporate enterprise but to sell it to the highest bidder revlon also contended that by gilbert v el paso co del ch  ad    it had contractual and good faith obligations to consider the noteholders however any such duties are limited to the principle that one may not interfere with contractual relationships by improper actions here the rights of the noteholders were fixed by agreement and there is nothing of substance to suggest that any of those terms were violated the notes covenants specifically contemplated a waiver to permit sale of the company at a fair price the notes were accepted by the holders on that basis including the risk of an adverse market effect stemming from a waiver thus nothing remained for revlon  to legitimately protect and no rationally related benefit thereby accrued to the stockholders under such circumstances we must conclude that the merger agreement with forstmann was unreasonable in relation to the threat posed a lockup is not per se illegal under delaware law its use has been approved in an earlier case thompson v enstar corp del ch  ad   such options can entice other bidders to enter a contest for control of the corporation creating an auction for the company and maximizing shareholder profit current economic conditions in the takeover market are such that a white knight like forstmann might only enter the bidding for the target company if it receives some form of compensation to cover the risks and costs involved note corporationsmergers — lockup enjoined under section e of securities exchange act — mobil corp v marathon oil co  fd  th cir  seton hall lrev    however while those lockups which draw bidders into the battle benefit shareholders similar measures which end an active auction and foreclose further bidding operate to the shareholders detriment note lockup options toward a state law standard  harv l rev    recently the united states court of appeals for the second circuit invalidated a lockup on fiduciary duty grounds similar to those here hanson trust plc et al v ml scm acquisition inc et al  fd  nd cir citing thompson v enstar corp supra with approval the court stated in this regard we are especially mindful that some lockup options may be beneficial to the shareholders such as those that induce a bidder to compete for control of a corporation while others may be harmful such as those that effectively preclude bidders from competing with the optionee bidder  fd at  in hanson trust the bidder hanson sought control of scm by a hostile cash tender offer scm management joined with merrill lynch to propose a leveraged buyout of the company at a higher price and hanson in turn increased its offer then despite very little improvement in its subsequent bid the management group sought a lockup option to purchase scms two main assets at a substantial discount the scm directors granted the lockup without adequate information as to the size of the discount or the effect the transaction would have on the company their action effectively ended a competitive bidding situation the hanson court invalidated the lockup because the directors failed to fully inform themselves about the value of a transaction in which management had a strong selfinterest in short the board appears to have failed to ensure that negotiations for alternative bids were conducted by those whose only loyalty was to the shareholders id at  the forstmann option had a similar destructive effect on the auction process forstmann had already been drawn into the contest on a preferred basis so the result of the lockup was not to foster bidding but to destroy it the boards stated reasons for approving the transactions were  better financing  noteholder  protection and  higher price as the court of chancery found and we agree any distinctions between the rival bidders methods of financing the proposal were nominal at best and such a consideration has little or no significance in a cash offer for any and all shares the principal object contrary to the boards duty of care appears to have been protection of the noteholders over the shareholders interests while forstmanns  offer was objectively higher than pantry prides  bid the margin of superiority is less when the forstmann price is adjusted for the time value of money in reality the revlon board ended the auction in return for very little actual improvement in the final bid the principal benefit went to the directors who avoided personal liability to a class of creditors to whom the board owed no further duty under the circumstances thus when a board ends an intense bidding contest on an insubstantial basis and where a significant byproduct of that action is to protect the directors against a perceived threat of personal liability for consequences stemming from the adoption of previous defensive measures the action cannot withstand the enhanced scrutiny which unocal requires of director conduct see unocal  ad at  in addition to the lockup option the court of chancery enjoined the noshop provision as part of the attempt to foreclose further bidding by pantry pride macandrews  forbes holdings inc v revlon inc  ad at  the noshop provision like the lockup option while not per se illegal is impermissible under the unocal standards when a boards primary duty becomes that of an auctioneer responsible for selling the company to the highest bidder the agreement to negotiate only with forstmann ended rather than intensified the boards involvement in the bidding contest it is ironic that the parties even considered a noshop agreement when revlon had dealt preferentially and almost exclusively with forstmann throughout the contest after the directors authorized management to negotiate with other parties forstmann was given every negotiating advantage that pantry pride had been denied cooperation from management access to financial data and the exclusive opportunity to present merger proposals directly to the board of directors favoritism for a white knight to the total exclusion of a hostile bidder might be justifiable when the latters offer adversely affects shareholder interests but when bidders make relatively similar offers or dissolution of the company becomes inevitable the directors cannot fulfill their enhanced unocal duties by playing favorites with the contending factions market forces must be allowed to operate freely to bring the targets shareholders the best price available for their equity thus as the trial court ruled the shareholders interests necessitated that the board remain free to negotiate in the fulfillment of that duty the court below similarly enjoined the payment of the cancellation fee pending a resolution of the merits because the fee was part of the overall plan to thwart pantry prides efforts we find no abuse of discretion in that ruling iv having concluded that pantry pride has shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits we address the issue of irreparable harm the court of chancery ruled that unless the lockup and other aspects of the agreement were enjoined pantry prides opportunity to bid for revlon was lost the court also held that the need for both bidders to compete  in the marketplace outweighed any injury to forstmann given the complexity of the proposed transaction between revlon and forstmann the obstacles to pantry pride obtaining a meaningful legal remedy are immense we are satisfied that the plaintiff has shown the need for an injunction to protect it from irreparable harm which need outweighs any harm to the defendants v in conclusion the revlon board was confronted with a situation not uncommon in the current wave of corporate takeovers a hostile and determined bidder sought the company at a price the board was convinced was inadequate the initial defensive tactics worked to the benefit of the shareholders and thus the board was able to sustain its unocal burdens in justifying those measures however in granting an asset option lockup to forstmann we must conclude that under all the circumstances the directors allowed considerations other than the maximization of shareholder profit to affect their judgment and followed a course that ended the auction for revlon absent court intervention to the ultimate detriment of its shareholders no such defensive measure can be sustained when it represents a breach of the directors fundamental duty of care see smith v van gorkom delsupr  ad    in that context the boards action is not entitled to the deference accorded it by the business judgment rule the measures were properly enjoined the decision of the court of chancery therefore is affirmed  the nominal plaintiff macandrews  forbes holdings inc is the controlling stockholder of pantry pride for all practical purposes their interests in this litigation are virtually identical and we hereafter will refer to pantry pride as the plaintiff  this appeal was heard on an expedited basis in light of the pending pantry pride offer and the revlonforstmann transactions we accepted the appeal on friday october   received the parties opening briefs on october  their reply briefs on october  and heard argument on thursday october  we announced our decision to affirm in an oral ruling in open court at  am on friday november  with the proviso that this more detailed written opinion would follow in due course  there were  directors on the revlon board six of them held senior management positions with the company and two others held significant blocks of its stock four of the remaining six directors were associated at some point with entities that had various business relationships with revlon on the basis of this limited record however we cannot conclude that this board is entitled to certain presumptions that generally attach to the decisions of a board whose majority consists of truly outside independent directors see polk v good  texaco delsupr  ad    moran v household international inc delsupr  ad    unocal corp v mesa petroleum co delsupr  ad    aronson v lewis delsupr  ad     puma v marriott del ch  ad     like bonds the notes actually were issued in denominations of  and integral multiples thereof a separate certificate was issued in a total principal amount equal to the remaining sum to which a stockholder was entitled likewise in the esoteric parlance of bond dealers a note trading at par  would be quoted on the market at   in the takeover context golden parachutes generally are understood to be termination agreements providing substantial bonuses and other benefits for managers and certain directors upon a change in control of a company  forstmanns  offer ostensibly is worth  more than pantry prides  bid however the pantry pride offer was immediate while the forstmann proposal must be discounted for the time value of money because of the delay in approving the merger and consummating the transaction the exact difference between the two bids was an unsettled point of contention even at oral argument  actually at this time about  million of forstmanns funding was still subject to two investment banks using their best efforts to organize a syndicate to provide the balance pantry prides entire financing was not firmly committed at this point either although pantry pride represented in an october  letter to lazard freres that its investment banker drexel burnham lambert was highly confident of its ability to raise the balance of  million drexel burnham had a firm commitment for this sum by october   the pertinent provision of the statute is a the business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation  delc § a  the statute provides in pertinent part b the board of directors of each corporation which desires to merge or consolidate shall adopt a resolution approving an agreement of merger or consolidation  delc § b  one eminent corporate commentator has drawn a distinction between the business judgment rule which insulates directors and management from personal liability for their business decisions and the business judgment doctrine which protects the decision itself from attack the principles upon which the rule and doctrine operate are identical while the objects of their protection are different see hinsey business judgment and the american law institutes corporate governance project the rule the doctrine and the reality  geo wash lrev    in the transactional justification cases where the doctrine is said to apply our decisions have not observed the distinction in such terminology see polk v good  texaco delsupr  ad    moran v household international inc del supr  ad    unocal corp v mesa petroleum co delsupr  ad    rosenblatt v getty oil co del supr  ad    under the circumstances we do not alter our earlier practice of referring only to the business judgment rule although in transactional justification matters such reference may be understood to embrace the concept of the doctrine  the relevant provision of section  is every corporation created under this chapter shall have power to  make contracts including contracts of guaranty and suretyship incur liabilities borrow money at such rates of interest as the corporation may determine issue its notes bonds and other obligations and secure any of its obligations by mortgage pledge or other encumbrance of all or any of its property franchises and income   delc §  see section a in n  supra see also section a n  infra  as we noted in moran a bustup takeover generally refers to a situation in which one seeks to finance an acquisition by selling off pieces of the acquired company presumably at a substantial profit see moran  ad at  n   the pertinent provision of this statute is a every corporation may purchase redeem receive take or otherwise acquire own and hold sell lend exchange transfer or otherwise dispose of pledge use and otherwise deal in and with its own shares  delc § a  for further discussion of the benefits and detriments of lockup options also see nelson mobil corp v marathon oil co — the decision and its implications for future tender offers  corp lrev    note swallowing the key to lockup options mobil corp v marathon oil co  utollrev     the federal courts generally have declined to enjoin lockup options despite arguments that lockups constitute impermissible manipulative conduct forbidden by section e of the williams act  usc § ne see buffalo forge co v ogden corp  fd  nd cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   data probe acquisition corp v datatab inc  fd  nd cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   but see mobil corp v marathon oil co  fd  th cir the cases are all federal in nature and were not decided on state law grounds  by this we do not embrace the passivity thesis rejected in unocal see  ad at  nn  the directors role remains an active one changed only in the respect that they are charged with the duty of selling the company at the highest price attainable for the
