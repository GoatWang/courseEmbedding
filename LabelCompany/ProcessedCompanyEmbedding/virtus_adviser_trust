services to the funds was appropriate and consistent with the terms of the new subadvisory agreement they also concluded that the quality of vontobels services to the funds has been very good in reaching their conclusions the trustees considered the factors described above as well as the following  because vontobels principal responsibility is management of the funds investment portfolios the investment performance achieved by vontobel is an important indicator of the quality of services provided  the quality of vontobels services to the funds has been consistent with or superior to quality norms in the mutual fund industry  vontobel has sufficient personnel with the appropriate education and experience to serve the funds effectively and has demonstrated its ability to attract and retain well qualified personnel and   vontobels financial condition is sound and vontobel is part of a much larger financial services enterprise with very substantial financial resources the trustees concluded that the fees that pic will pay to vontobel under the new subadvisory agreement are reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services to be provided taking into account the fees charged by other advisers for managing comparable mutual funds with similar strategies and the fees vontobel charges to other clients the trustees concluded that other than the services to be provided by vontobel to the funds pursuant to the proposed agreements and the fees to be paid by pic therefor the funds and vontobel may potentially benefit from their relationship with each other in other ways they concluded that vontobel would benefit from the receipt of proprietary research products and services to be acquired through commissions paid on portfolio transactions of the funds and that the funds would benefit from vontobels receipt of those products and services as well as research products and services acquired through commissions paid by other clients of vontobel they also concluded that success of the funds could attract other business to vontobel or its other funds and that the success of vontobel could enhance vontobels ability to serve the funds the trustees including all of the disinterested trustees unanimously recommend that you vote for the approval of the new subadvisory agreement brokerage partners  99 edgar online inc all rights
