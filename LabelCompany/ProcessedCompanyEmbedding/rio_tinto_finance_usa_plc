years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto recent mergers acquisitions and eventsedit major acquisitions following the consolidated zinc merger included us borax a

production restricting exports and threatening nationalisation of the mines although company management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii nonetheless francos meddling caused the mines production and profitability to fall precipitously during and after the war leading the company to ultimately exit from its spanish operations in  in  rio tinto was criticised by the guinean government for the many mining delays at the local simandou mine cece

from the government of norway which divested itself from rio tinto shares and banned further investment due to environmental concerns claims of severe environmental damages related to rio tintos engagement in the grasberg mine in indonesia led the government pension fund of norway to exclude rio tinto from its investment portfolio the fund which is said to be the worlds secondlargest pension fund sold shares in the company valued at  billion kr us million to avoid contributing to environmental damages caused by the company exclusion of a company from the fund reflects our unwillingness to run an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct the council on ethics has concluded that rio tinto is directly involved through its participation in the grasberg mine in

tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto

comes from the rio tinto in southwestern spain which has flowed red since mining began there about  years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto recent mergers acquisitions and eventsedit major acquisitions following the consolidated zinc merger included us borax a major producer of borax bought in  kennecott utah copper and bp australias coal

management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii

comes from the rio tinto in southwestern spain which has flowed red since mining began there about  years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto recent mergers acquisitions and eventsedit major acquisitions following the consolidated zinc merger included us borax a major producer of borax bought in  kennecott utah copper and bp australias coal

supplies for use by spain and its axis allies germany and italy forcing price controls on the companys production restricting exports and threatening nationalisation of the mines although company management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii

rio tinto from its investment portfolio the fund which is said to be the worlds secondlargest pension fund sold shares in the company valued at  billion kr us million to avoid contributing to environmental damages caused by the company exclusion of a company from the fund reflects our unwillingness to run an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct the council on

comes from the rio tinto in southwestern spain which has flowed red since mining began there about  years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto

supplies for use by spain and its axis allies germany and italy forcing price controls on the companys production restricting exports and threatening nationalisation of the mines although company management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii

allegations  sec investigation  see also  references  external links formationedit the companys name comes from the rio tinto in southwestern spain which has flowed red since mining began there about  years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto recent mergers acquisitions and eventsedit major acquisitions following the consolidated zinc merger included us borax a

in world war iiedit rio tintos status as a mainly britishowned company located in spain and producing pyrites – an important material for military applications – created a complicated set of circumstances for the companys operation in the s and s during the spanish civil war the region in which rio tintos mines were located came under the control of general francos nationalists in  however franco increasingly intervened in the companys operations at times requisitioning pyrite supplies for use by spain and its axis allies germany and italy forcing price controls on the companys production restricting exports and threatening nationalisation of the mines although company management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii nonetheless francos meddling caused the mines production and profitability to fall precipitously during and after the war leading the company to ultimately exit from its spanish operations in  in  rio tinto was criticised by the guinean government for the many mining delays at the local simandou mine cece noramou government official said the government was “running out of patience” and president alpha conde himself said that there have been people at simandou for  years  years and they’ve never produced a ton of iron in late  rio tinto agreed to sell its stake in the simandou iron ore mine to chinalco and exit the deal the deal was negotiated after the company’s case against vale and bsgr

its mining methods due to environmental degradation the companys coal operations for their contribution to global warming and uranium operations for environmental and nuclear technology concerns rio tinto owns a  stake in the grasberg mine in indonesia it has been the focus of environmental concerns photo by alfindra primaldhi perhaps the most significant environmental criticism to date has come from the government of norway which divested itself from rio tinto shares and banned further investment due to environmental concerns claims of severe environmental damages related to rio tintos engagement in the grasberg mine in indonesia led the government pension fund of norway to exclude rio tinto from its investment portfolio the fund which is said to be the worlds secondlargest pension fund sold shares in the company valued at  billion kr us million to avoid contributing to environmental damages caused by the company exclusion of a company from the fund reflects our unwillingness to run an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct the council on ethics has concluded that rio tinto is directly involved through its participation in the grasberg mine in indonesia in the severe environmental damage caused by that mining operation — kristin halvorsen norwegian minister of finance rio tinto disputes the claims of environmental damage at the grasberg mine and states that the company has long maintained an excellent record on environmental issues labour and human rightsedit activist groups have also expressed concern regarding rio tintos operations in papua new guinea which they allege were one catalyst of the bougainville separatist crisis the british antipoverty charity war on want has also criticised rio tinto for its complicity in the serious human rights violations which have occurred near the mines it operates in indonesia and papua new guinea on  january  rio tinto locked out nearly  workers from a mine in boron california usa rio tinto was also accused of planning and funding the murder of rti activist shehla masood in bhopal india apparently she was protesting illegal diamond mining done by rio tinto in connivance with government officers the case was however solved and no connection to rio tinto was established though popular opinion still perceives them as the possible culprit rio tinto is not however universally

comes from the rio tinto in southwestern spain which has flowed red since mining began there about  years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto

management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii

comes from the rio tinto in southwestern spain which has flowed red since mining began there about  years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto recent mergers acquisitions and eventsedit major acquisitions following the consolidated zinc merger included us borax a major producer of borax bought in  kennecott utah copper and bp australias coal
