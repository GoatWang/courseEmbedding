assessments that integrate technical operational programmatic policy and business aspects of national security    kirkland h donald the son of a world war ii veteran received an appointment to the us naval academy upon graduating the future admiral began a year career in the navy working with nuclear submarines he served as the commander of the naval submarine forces and also as deputy administrator of the national nuclear security administration’s naval reactors he retired last year and joined spa where he will now lead the company what were some of your strengths early on in the navy i give a lot of credit to the leadership of people who were my commanding officers and mentors during my time in the navy i had a wonderful set of leaders particularly on my first ship i was on the uss batfish an attack submarine we had a dozen or so officers and  or so handselected enlisted folks it was a very tightknit group that worked very very hard it was the height of the cold war we were deploying all the time and you never knew where you were going to be next if anything the culture and environment around that type of job brings about the most important success factors for people to succeed you have to be willing to work hard you have to have the physical and mental stamina to withstand the rigors of getting the job done it wasn’t like i stood out it was a team effort it became the way i understood how to do business talk about some indelible marks mentors made on you entering into adm hyman rickover’s program really shaped me he thought that i could do better than what i was doing he challenged me to fulfill my potential i was really impacted by meeting him and seeing his standards for excellence he was always striving for excellence if you aren’t getting better you’re getting behind you have to be an expert you have to know your stuff you have to work at that constantly there will be bumps in the road it’s how you respond and deal with them what were some of your proudest moments in the navy those instances where you’ve been able to pull together a team and get hard things done those are the ones that stand out the most when i had command of the uss key west in the eyes of a submariner that’s a pinnacle of your career you’re always working to build a team you’re dealing with constantly changing schedules and transfers of people in and out also it’s pretty complex technology you’re dealing with it’s a very harsh environment you’re dealing with we enjoyed success on that ship it was the fact that we did it as a team and pulled together through good times leaving the ship in a better condition than when we found it what do you bring to spa it’s been a very successful company for a very long time i do have some different perspectives having come from where i came from to the extent that that is helpful and continuing to satisfy our customers and deal with challenging customers and continue doing work for senior leaders that’s what i think i can do i can certainly bring enthusiasm to the job reading any business books i tend to lean more toward history the one i’m reading now is because of some work i’m doing for a congressionally appointed panel that i’m on that looks into governance in the nuclear security enterprise i’m reading “the making of the atomic bomb” by richard rhodes it’s an anthology of all that went into the manhattan project it’s not a business book but if you look at how you mobilize for such a large undertaking there are lessons there in organizational leadership there’s another book i read called “six frigates” by ian toll it’s about how we built the first frigates in the navy there’s a lot of lessons in there about how difficult it is to take on large governmentsponsored projects we think we have challenges today in building ships but if you look back into the late s it wasn’t all that different — interview with vanessa small business capitalbusiness false afterth true please
