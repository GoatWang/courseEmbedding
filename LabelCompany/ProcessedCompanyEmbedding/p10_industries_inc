period in  cost of product revenue from discontinued operations the cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue was  and  in  and  respectively the increase in cost as a percentage of revenue was related to lower manufacturing absorption associated with the decreased production in  during  and  we operated a manufacturing facility that had a manufacturing and testing capacity significantly greater than what was required by our product revenue levels our manufacturing operational costs included a large portion of fixed costs relative to our operational needs we expensed the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues cost of service and other revenue from discontinued operations the cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of total service and other revenue increased by  to  in  compared to  in  the increase in cost as a percentage of revenue reflects higher unabsorbed costs associated with the  service revenue decline gross profit from discontinued operations our gross profit was  of revenue for fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  this margin decrease was due to higher unabsorbed costs associated with lower revenue we implemented additional cost control measures in  including one week of unpaid furlough per quarter for all us based employees curtailed overtime and reduced contract labor but those measures were insufficient to offset the revenue decline research and development from discontinued operations research and development expenses were approximately  million in  a reduction of approximately  million or  from the approximately  million in expenses in fiscal  the decrease was primarily due the  reduction in the operating period for  cost control measures put in

partially by  million higher stock compensation expense loss on sale of discontinued operations we incurred a loss on the sale of our discontinued operations as the result of the sale of assets in excess of liabilities of  million for a nominal amount in addition we accrued approximately  million to settle our outstanding lease obligations we wrote off approximately  million of cumulative translation adjustments associated with our divested foreign subsidiaries and we incurred  million of transaction costs net of shared expenses with langley interest expense net from discontinued operations net interest expense was  million in fiscal  compared to  million in  the interest expense incurred during  and  was in connection with the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility the debt outstanding on this facility was repaid at the closing of the sale of our discontinued operations to langley resulting in the debt being outstanding for a shorter period of time and therefore lower expense in  other income expense net from discontinued operations other income expense net was  in fiscal  and  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  this decrease primarily reflects foreign exchange losses or gains on settlement of intercompany balances and sales contracts held in foreign currencies income tax expense from discontinued operations we had no income tax expense in  or  we consider an accounting policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or require the use of judgment at the time we make that estimate and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we could have reasonably used instead in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in these and other items could still have a material impact upon our financial statements revenue recognition we recognized revenue for our discontinued operations when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured in general revenue is recognized when revenuegenerating transactions fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition we recognized product revenue at the time of shipment for a significant portion of all products sold directly to customers and through distributors because title and risk of loss typically pass on delivery to the common carrier our customers and distributors did not have the right to return products we sometimes entered into billandhold arrangements and when this occurred delivery may not be present but other criteria were reviewed to determine proper timing of revenue recognition unless performed under a maintenance agreement we recognized installation service and maintenance revenue at the time the service is performed we recognized revenue associated with maintenance agreements over the life of the contracts using the straightline method which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition were recorded as a current liability in the deferred revenue line of the consolidated balance sheet or longterm liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition we recognized revenue on certain rental programs over the life of the rental agreements using the straightline method amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or longterm liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue multiple element arrangements or meas are arrangements to sell products to customers that frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas included the sale of one or more of our cleansource ups or cleansource powerhouse products combined with one or more of the following products or services design services project management commissioning and installation services spare parts or consumables and maintenance agreements delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide certain services related to design and consulting may occur prior to product delivery commissioning and installation typically take place within six months of product delivery depending upon customer requirements maintenance agreements consumables and repair maintenance or consulting services generally are delivered over a period of one to five years when arrangements included multiple elements we allocated revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements had standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met we established the selling price of each element based on vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe if available third party evidence or tpe if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price or besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we generally determined selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements when arrangements included a maintenance agreement we recognized revenue related to the maintenance agreement at the relative selling price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement any taxes imposed by governmental authorities on our revenueproducing transactions with customers are shown in our consolidated statement of operations on a netbasis that is excluded from our reported revenues inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market we estimated inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record reserves for obsolescence or slowmoving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products the impact of new product introductions inventory turns and specific identification of items such as product discontinuance damaged goods or engineeringmaterial changes warranty liability estimated warranty liability costs were accrued for each of our products at the time of sale our estimates were principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each product including when little or no claims experience may exist due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimates changes in our assumptions could have a material effect on our reported operating results our estimate of warranty liability was reevaluated on a quarterly basis experience has shown that initial data for a new product can be very volatile due to factors such as product and component failure rates material usage and service delivery costs in correcting product failures therefore our process relied upon longterm historical averages until actual data is available as actual experience becomes available it was used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes the resulting balances were then compared to current spending rates to help ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations stockbased compensation stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information that can change significantly over time a small change in estimates used can have a relatively large impact on the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based upon our historical volatility estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity at december   was our cash on hand of approximately  million we have no credit facility and no operations that could be the source of additional cash however we are in the process of reviewing how we could monetize the intellectual property we retained after the sale of our discontinued operations to langley we do not currently have estimates of the amount or timing of the cash we may receive from this potential source we are in negotiations with several potential investors to raise funds through the sales of our equity securities we expect that these funds would fund our ongoing operating expenses as well as investments in profitable business acquisitions we expect that any such acquisitions would also involve borrowings under credit facilities if we meet our cost projections we expect that we will have adequate capital resources to continue operating for at least the next twelve months our projections and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding expected future costs these costs are currently limited to two executive employees and corporate overhead however there are scenarios in which our costs may exceed our estimates or we could face unexpected claims including costs associated with a lease for our former headquarters for which we remain responsible further our estimates may change and future events or developments may also affect our estimates any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage in fiscal  and beyond or significantly affect our level of liquidity if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or equity securities the ownership of our existing stockholders could be significantly diluted if we obtain additional debt financing a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding or funding on terms acceptable to us to continue our operations as planned we are currently in negotiations with langley the landlord and other potential tenants in an effort to reduce our obligations under the lease we are also in discussions with a potential investor that has indicated that it is contemplating an investment in shares of our common stock however the investor has indicated that it would be a condition to the closing of its investment that we make a filing under chapter  of the united states bankruptcy code pursuant to a prepackaged plan the prepackaged plan would provide for the issuance of the shares of our common stock to the potential investor in a manner which would not make the rights under our stockholders rights plan exercisable  in addition the prepackaged plan would also provide for the settlement our lease obligation we do not have a definitive agreement with the potential investor and we cannot assure you that the transactions described above will be consummated significant uses of cash operating activities the following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash used in operating activities in thousands annual change from percent year amount prior year change                  cash used in operating activities was approximately  million in fiscal  compared to approximately  million in  the increase in cash used in operating activities in fiscal  was primarily related to our net loss from continuing operations of  million and cash used by our discontinued operations of  million which included the loss on discontinued operations of  million partially offset by stock based compensation of approximately  million changes in our net working capital resulted in cash used of approximately  million in  compared to cash provided of approximately  million in  investing activities investing activities primarily consisted of the sale of our discontinued operations and the purchases of property and equipment for our discontinued    mar   c
