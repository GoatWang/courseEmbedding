holdings are the contents of an investment portfolio held by an individual or entity such as a mutual fund or a pension fund portfolio holdings may encompass a wide range of investment products from stocks bonds and mutual funds to options futures and exchangetraded funds etfs and relatively esoteric instruments such as private equity and hedge fundsbreakthe number and types of holdings within a portfolio contribute to the degree of its diversification a mix of stocks across different sectors bonds of different maturities and other investments would suggest a welldiversified portfolio while concentrated holdings in a handful of stocks within a single sector indicates a portfolio with very limited diversificationdiversification and acquisition of holdingsthe proportion of holdings within a portfolio has a significant impact on its overall return the performance of the largest holdings have a bigger influence on portfolio return than small or marginal holdings in the portfolio investors routinely scour the lists of the holdings of top money managers to piggyback on their trades these investors usually seek to replicate the trading activity of the best money managers by buying stocks where the manager has initiated a long position or added significantly to an existing position and selling positions where the manager has exited a stake this strategy may not always be successful for the average investor given the considerable lag between the period when the money manager or fund effected the trades and the time when the funds holdings are disseminated to the general publicholding companiesholding companies are a closely related concept in some cases investors may choose to own their holdings through a limited liability company llc they may do so to reduce their personal exposure to risk minimize their taxes or pool their investments with other people such as business associates or family members typically a holding company does not engage in business directly but only serves as an ownership vehicle of other companies or investmentsa very famous example of such a company is berkshire hathaway inc the omaha nebraska company that warren buffett controls and manages berkshire hathaway started as a textile manufacturing company but for several decades it has only been a holding company that buffett use to acquire hold and sell various investments in other companies some of berkshire hathaways largest holdings include the government employees insurance company geico dairy queen inc and the cocacola company breaking down holdings
