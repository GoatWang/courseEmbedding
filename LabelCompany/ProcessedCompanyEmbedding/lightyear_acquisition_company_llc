log out my account sign in help check order status check order status contact us corporations compared to llcs knowledge centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm

capital acquires aig advisor group industry consolidations and acquisitions aren’t likely to slow in  experts note and the announced acquisition of aig advisor group by a private equity firm only strengthens the argument  by john manganaro editorsstrategicicom  january   lightyear capital probably best known in the retirement plan services industry as a previous owner of the cetera advisory network is jumping back into the space with the purchase of aig advisor group retirement plan industry professionals may remember lightyear capital’s successful purchase reformation and eventual sale of cetera advisors and related brands to rcs capital back in —a process that undoubtedly brought nice profits to the firm given the premium  billionplus price tag paid by rcs lightyear was further advantaged in the sale in that it played a key role in the original formation of cetera following the acquisition of three ing brokerdealerslooking into the details of the newly announced acquisition by lightyear it appears american international group inc has agreed to sell aig advisor group “to investment funds affiliated with lightyear capital llc a private equity firm specializing in financial services investing and psp investments one of canada’s largest pension investment managers” the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of  subject to regulatory approvals further terms of the deal were not disclosed but it’s not very a difficult task to understand lightyear’s motivations aig advisor group is already among the largest networks of independent brokerdealers in the united states with “more than  independent advisers and more than  fulltime employees” given lightyears recent experience forming cetera into a profitable and wellrespected advisory shop a related game plan is likely in effect advisor group is actually comprised of four underlying brokerdealers which include fsc securities corporation in atlanta royal alliance associates in new york city sagepoint financial in phoenix and woodbury financial services in oakdale minnesota peter hancock president and chief executive officer of aig was predictably upbeat about the announced sale noting that aig “continues to review its business strategy and take actions to become a more efficient less complex company” hancock says his firm “looks forward to a continued relationship with advisor group as an important distributor of aig products”lightyear capital through its three affiliated private equity funds has now “raised over  billion of capital and makes primarily control investments

to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm
