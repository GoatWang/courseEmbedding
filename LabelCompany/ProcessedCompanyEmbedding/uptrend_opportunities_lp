suppliers guide state of the industry top 5 webinars southeastern showcase buyers guide classifieds growth summit hall of fame propane prices on uptrend with improved fundamentals january   by mark rachal and dale delay     propane prices have been on a strong uptrend over the past year as fundamental conditions improve mont belvieu propane is currently trading at around  cents at this point last year mont belvieu was trading at  cents and trending lower in fact the yearlow close came on jan  at 5 cents prices are  percent of last year’s price and 4 percent of last year’s low meanwhile west texas intermediate crude is  percent of its january 6 price and 5 percent of its 6 low set in february 6 the pricing data shows that propane prices have outgained crude over the past year last january mont belvieu propane was trading at about  percent of west texas intermediate currently mont belvieu is trading at around  percent propane is now valued right at its fiveyear high relative to crude set in  propane was valued above its fiveyear average relative to crude for most of 6 and even set some new fiveyear highs last year the higher gains in propane and resulting improvement in relative value to crude suggest changes in propane fundamentals are at play until recently winter weather hasn’t been that much more supportive this year compared to last year the key reason for the improvement in propane’s relative value is an increase in the ability to move propane production to markets new export facilities have eliminated the bottleneck that had suppressed propane values relative to crude in the past reports show a current export capacity of around  million barrels per day bpd in december  the us energy information administration eia provided weekly estimates on propane exports of  bpd in december 6 the estimate was  bpd for the week ending dec  eia estimated  million bpd of exports – the highest weekly estimate ever even that rate is only  percent of the estimated export capacity propane production continues to grow but at a much slower pace than in previous years at some point increases in production will catch up to the new capacity which could suppress prices again if additions in export capacity are not made but for now the bottleneck is eliminated allowing us propane prices to fully reflect global demand as long as spare export capacity exists there will be increased risk to upside pricing pressure there will also likely be less downward pressure on prices over the summer which would mean the opportunity to buy supply in  for as low as it was in 6 is also at risk call cost management solutions today for more information about how client services can enhance your business at   or drop us an email at infopropanecostcom this article
