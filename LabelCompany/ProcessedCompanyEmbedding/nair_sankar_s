october   ajaysankarnair   comments to be successful in business you should know how to manage your business and strategise your success in my new post ‘’strategy  management tools’’ i have compiled a list of tools to manage your business and strategise your success ansoff’s matrix also known as productmarket expansion grid– ansoff matrix classifies and explains different growth strategies for a company this matrix is used by companies which have a growth target or a strategy of specialization this tool crossing products and markets of a company facilitates decision making the ansoff matrix offers four strategies to achieve the objectives penetration of the market  extension of the market  new products  diversification benchmarking– benchmarking is the process of measuring products services and processes against those of organizations known to be leaders in one or more aspects of their operations benchmarking provides necessary insights to help you understand how your organization compares with similar organizations even if they are in a different business or have a different group of customers benchmarking has been classified into two distinct categories technical benchmarking competitive benchmarking blue ocean strategy– blue ocean strategy describes how organizations should try and find a way to work in a marketplace that isn’t bloodied by the competition and is free of competitors four actions can help to create a blue ocean strategy the actions are found by answering these questions which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated which factors should be reduced well below the industry’s standard which factors should be raised well above the industry’s standard which factors should be created that the industry has never offered boston matrix also known as the bcg matrix the growthshare matrix and portfolio analysis– boston matrix helps organizations figure out which areas of their business deserve more resources and investment the matrix framework categorizes products within a company’s portfolio according to each product’s growth rate market share and positive or negative cash flow by using positive cash flows a company can capitalize on growth opportunities competitive advantage– the competitive advantage ca model of porter learns that competitive strategy is about taking offensive or defensive action to create a defendable position in an industry in order to cope successfully with competitive forces and generate a superior return on investment according to michael porter the basis of aboveaverage performance within an industry is sustainable competitive advantage there are  basic types of ca cost leadership low cost differentiation core competencies– a core competency is a deep proficiency that enables a company to deliver unique value to customers it embodies an organization’s collective learning particularly of how to coordinate diverse production skills and integrate multiple technologies such a core competency creates sustainable competitive advantage for a company and helps it branch into a wide variety of related markets core competencies also contribute substantially to the benefits a company’s products offer customers understanding core competencies allows companies to invest in the strengths that differentiate them and set strategies that unify their entire organization economic value added eva– economic value added measures a corporation’s true economic profit the objective of eva is to understand which business units’ best leverage their assets to generate returns and maximise shareholder value five forces model – porter’s five forces help to identify where power lies in a business situation this is useful both in understanding the strength of an organisation’scurrent competitive position and the strength of a position that an organisation may look to move into strategic analysts often use porter’s five forces to understand whether new products or services are potentially profitable force field analysis – force field analysis is a general tool for systematically analyzing the factors found in complex problems it frames problems in terms of factors or pressures that support the status quo restraining forces and those pressures that support change in the desired direction driving forces a factor can be people resources attitudes traditions regulations values needs desires etc as a tool for managing change force field analysis helps identify those factors that must be addressed and monitored if change is to be successful goals and methods matrix – turner and cochrane’s goals and methods matrix judge the projects based on two parameters whether the goals are well defined whether the methods of achieving them are well defined the resulting  x  matrix implies four types of project typel projects for which the goals and methods of achieving the project are well defined typeprojects for which the goals are well defined but the methods are not type projects for which the goals are not well defined but the methods are type projects for which neither the goals nor the methods are well defined hayes and wheelwright‘s productprocess matrix this matrix is to examine market manufacturing congruence issues and to facilitate the understanding of the strategic options available to a company the matrix itself consists of two dimensions product structureproduct life cycle and process structureprocess life cycle the production process used to manufacture a product moves through a series of stages much like the stages of products and markets which begins with a highly flexible highcost process and progresses toward increasing standardization mechanization and automation culminating in an inflexible but a costeffective process the process structureprocess life cycle dimension describes the process choice job shop batch assembly line and continuous flow and process structure jumbled flow disconnected line flow connected line flow and continuous flow while the product structureproduct life cycle describes the four stages of the product life cycle low volume to high volume and product structure low to high standardisation kano model analysis– kano model analysis is a useful technique for deciding which features you want to include in a product or service it helps you break away from a profitminimizing mindset that says you’ve got to have as many features as possible in a product and helps you think more subtly about the features you include this can be the difference between a product or service being profitable or unprofitable mckinsey s framework – the mckinsey  s framework is a popular model used in organizations to analyse the environment to investigate if the company is achieving its intended objectives the model proposes  interdependent factors –  hard ‘s’ iestrategy structure systems and  soft ‘s’ ie shared values skills style and staff the hard ‘s’ are more tangible easy to define and easy to influence than the soft ‘s’ organisational configuration – henry mintzberg theory is that an organisation’sstructure emerges from the interaction of the organisation’s strategy the environmental forces it experiences and the organisational structure it has when these fit together well they combine to create organisations that can perform well when they don’t fit then the organisation is likely to experience problems mintzberg has defined a number of organisational types and by understanding them you can analyse whether a company’s structure is well suited to its conditions if it isn’t analysis can start to on what needs to be done to change things the main structures of organisations that he identifies are the entrepreneurial organisation the machine organisation bureaucracy the professional organisation the divisional diversified organisation the innovative organisation adhocracy puttick grid– the grid was introduced as a methodology through which a manufacturing or service company could develop an operational strategy which was wholly aligned to delivering specific customer values to this end the grid assists companies to evaluate how does the market view a company’s productmarket arena today how will the market view a company’s productmarket arena tomorrow thus the company is able to prepare its strategies and plans in the light of the how the customer views and appreciates the products it wishes to acquire and the characteristics of the acquisition process rather than how the organisation views its own products strengths and weaknesses product families are placed in one of four categories super value goods productsservices with timelimited windows of opportunity eg fashion goods spares consumer durables commodities strategic audit– a strategy audit is a review of a company’s business plan and strategies to identify weaknesses and shortcomings and enable a successful development of the company the strategy audit secures that all necessary information for the development of the company are included in the business plan and that the management supports it does your business plan cover the key areas and the critical issues for the company’s future success clarify and verify your business model provide guidance for daily operations and activities correspond with the management team’s opinion and priorities team role theory also known as belbin’s team roles – team role theory is used to identify people’s behavioural strengths and weaknesses in the workplace this information can be used to build productive working relationships select and develop highperforming teams raise selfawareness and personal effectiveness build mutual trust and understanding aid recruitment processes terry hill framework– the process of how internal operational capabilities are converted to a criteria that may lead to competitive advantage and market success professor terry hill emphasised the interactions and cooperation between operations and marketing the operations people are responsible for providing the orderwinning and orderqualifying criteria—identified by marketing—that enable products to win orders in the marketplace this process starts with the corporate strategy and ends with the criteria that either keeps the company in the running ie order qualifiers or wins the customer’s business vrio analysisthe vrio analysis is an analytical technique which for each type of resource considers several evaluation dimensions for the organization as well as for its competitors vrio is an acronym from the initials of the names of the dimensions value rareness imitability organization it is a way of evaluating the resources of an organization which are divided as follows financial resources human resources material resources nonmaterial resources information knowledge value chain analysis– value chain analysis is a strategic tool used to analyze internal firm activities its goal is to recognize which activities are the most valuable ie are the source of cost or differentiation advantage to the firm and which ones could be improved to provide competitive advantage images courtesy google india post how to feed a starving lion october october   ajaysankarnair  leave a comment india post according to wikipedia it has  post offices of which   percent in rural areas and   percent in urban areas and has employee strength over  imagine what if a company like amazon ebay or indian companies like flipkart or snapdeal has these many offices and employees india post would have become another deutsche post dhl it is due to lack of vision of people at the helm of the this organisation that has made once a prestigious organisation to a loss making organisation with the present infrastructure there are many ways to revive this government organisaiton and change it to a profit making body as a supply chainer to change it to a profit making body i will reengineer the business process in following ways as this is a linkedin post i am only listing a few important points  train the employees bring in experts in the field and of change management for employees to understand why the change in their organisation  warehouse build the warehouses or share the existing warehouses of governmentorganisation in strategically located cities if the organisation should become a one stop shop for all logistics requirements they should have warehouses in key cities  distribution center  reverse fulfillment center convert every post office into a secondary distribution center and reverse fulfillment center every post office can act as a point of contact or a link between manufacturer  ecommerce company and the end customers the office will be a secondary distribution center that delivers the shipment to the customer and also pick the consignment from the customer as part of the reverse fulfillment process  it networking massive investment in it infrastructure is required this includes establishing a communication link between the india post’s customer manufacturer  ecommerce company and the post offices itself  tracking deviceshandheld devices upgrading or introducing handheld devices for its delivery team so that the sender can know the status of the delivery meanwhile the india post’s fleet should be equipped with tracking devices so that its logistics team is aware of every truck’s movement these are a few points that they should implement to become a real competitor in the field of logistics once india post becomes a truly logistics solution provider it can reach out to the people within  hours or  hours following three points would be india post’s unique selling point when pitching for new business from the private companies at present in the india post website i can see a general manager’s email address and contact number for the private company that wants to do business with india post it is laughable and not surprised because that is how an indian government organisation function office space aggregation as said earlier in the post india post has more than  offices across india most of the office space can be used as storage places for small consignments personnel aggregation since the introduction of email the employees have less work to do and more time to relax therefore india post’s personnel can be utilised so that it benefits the india post clients and customer transportation aggregation india post’s fleet can be used for delivering heavy shipments some of the trucks can be upgraded to temperature controlled truck that can deliver food products flowers etc when india post becomes a professionally managed logistics company they can deal with companies from various industries ranging from flower vendors ecommerce companies to oem manufacturing companies once indian post succeeds to become a successful pl company it can enter the international market india post’s officepersonnel data sourced from wikipedia
