john peter walker stanley nelson sentinel editor feb    in the early th century surveyor john peter walker died while in political exile in spain his banishment abroad can be traced back to his days in concordia when he was the chief surveyor for the spanishwalker’s career began when andrew ellicott hired him as a chain bearer on a survey crewthen the foremost cartographer in the united states ellicott was the american boundary commissioner in charge of marking the line established by treaty along the st parallel separating the us and spanish florida work began shortly after congress created mississippi territory in  the new boundary began about  miles as the crow flies south of natchez on the east side of the mississippi river and continued east to the atlantic us  south crosses that line that today separates wilkinson county miss below woodville and west feliciana la above st francisvillepleased with walkers work and thinking one of his daughters might find the young man promising husband material ellicott asked walker to go with him to philadelphia to produce maps and charts resulting from the survey and soon due the us government a romance failed to blossomonce there walker entered classes at philadelphia academy better known today as the university of pennsylvania he often wrote home to his father in natchezi am presently studying astronomy” he explained in one letter “i have went through navigation and surveying in a couple of weeks i shall begin algebra i am first in a class of more than  he said he spent his evenings studying modern europeone of the most impressive products of the boundary work was a  foot inch tin map which didn’t survive long when the british bombed washington during the war of  this map was destroyedscraping by on pennies and waiting for the american government to pay him for his work walker learned that spain had not only paid its boundary employees on time but had provided them bonuses and lavished great praise on their work and then unsettling news arrivedin  the new governor of mississippi territory wcc claiborne fired walker’s father who had worked as a legislative clerk and for mississippi’s first governor winthrop sargentout of money john peter walker returned home in fall of  his dreams of traveling abroad crushed the slow pay for his boundary work and the political changes soured walker on the united statesnew life in concordiathe walker family made an economic decision at that point they crossed the river to concordia to go to work for the spanish government under captain jose vidal at the same time john walker apparently made a philosophical and political decision as well now this son of an english father and french mother became juan pedro walker and identified himself as a servant of spain it was in concordia parish that he first began to sign his name as juan pedro walkerwalker quickly became the official surveyor of concordia spending much of his time surveying property bordering the mississippi and lakes concordia and st johnin  the spanish sent walker to nacogdoches texas to oversee the construction of a church the spanish liked what they saw in walker he talents were many but his promising skills as a cartographer were unmatched it didn’t hurt that he spoke three languages and that he understood how the spanish bureaucracy workedbut by august  just as things were looking up the americans stepped on his toes againnews reached concordia of the louisiana purchase spanish concordia would soon become american concordia walker was devastated he moved to spanish lands west of the sabine riverfor the next years of his life walker traveled throughout mexico and what is now the american southwest surveying for the spanish he made field notes he made mapsin the spring of  he directed a military school in mexico the next year he was sent back to nacogdoches as the spanish and americans faced off in a border dispute along the sabine river in  walker was appointed as the host of american lt zebulon pike during pikes exploration of the southwest he also served as interpreter pike had crossed into spanish territory maybe purposely and was detained for a few weeks by spanish authoritiescesar  the nolan partyprior to pikes detainment walker came into contact with a slave named cesar who had served as indian interpreter under gov sargents administration in natchez cesar had joined horse hunter philip nolan’s fourth and final expedition to spanish texas to catch wild horses tame them and then drive them home to american natchez for salethe spanish had warned nolan against this fourth venture as relations between spain and the us fell apart a spanish company caught up with the nolan party in eastcentral texas nolan was killed in a gunfight the only casualtycesar and almost twodozen surviving members of the expedition were captured tried and imprisoned the fate of most isnt known one was executedwalker had known cesar in natchez and had worked with him on the line before sargent recruited cesar as an indian interpreter walker and cesar renewed what had been a friendship in natchez and lived together in mexico for a period of time‘without any means’ in  walkers path however took a revolutionary turn this idealistic young man now  supported the independence movement in mexico led by father hidalgo subsequently walker was arrested and jailed by the very spaniards he had long served for the next six years he continued to survey and make maps although he was technically under arrest and to be tried for his seditious actionsspanish authorities later ruled evidence too scant to convict or exonerate him instead they decided he should be permanently exiled to spain where he could appeal his case from there he wrote a letter home in when robert dabney calhoun was writing his history of concordia parish published in  a walker descendant state representative gp whittington of alexandria visited calhoun at his office in the old town of vidalia along the riverfront whittington an historian showed calhoun the letter walker had written home to family i am at present … without any means except a small quantity of purse money assigned to me by the captain general until the determination of the court for my existenceneither whittington nor the walker descendants knew what the letter meant they also didnt know their relative’s fatein spain walker was allowed to argue an appeal of his sentence but he lost the crown issued its ruling  walker could never leave spain he would never see his family againwhile the spanish provided him a small government stipend on which to live in exile he was forbidden to live in any port city or near a seat of government a home along the sea might tempt him to escape back to america and the spanish didnt want him around any government seat for fear that his revolutionary thinking exposed in mexico might be reborn in spainhe died a decade later in  at the age of historian elizabeth johns – “the riddle of mapmaker juan pedro walker” essays on the history of north american discovery and exploration  – put together the details of walker’s life as a spaniard she wrote that walkers field notes
