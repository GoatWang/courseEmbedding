integrated offering with our innovation we have been displacing several competitors over the last few years as we continue to gain market share the gap between harman and its competitors has been widening at a faster pace we have broken this down for you on page six of your slide deck if you quickly look at slide deck you will see since the first quarter of fiscal  we have recognized over  billion in automotive revenues during the same period we booked over  billion of new awards this means our awards are growing faster than our revenue and our book to bill ratio is  in our most profitable business that is car audio and sound management the awards grew even faster with a book to bill ratio of  let me talk a little more about our recent wins in the car audio and sound management business following a successful launch of the revel brand in lincoln vehicles im pleased to announce the extension of our business with ford under this longterm partnership we will supply bo play branded car audio systems to fords vehicles cross car line globally in the connected car division we had wins across geographies and vehicle categories including orders for highend fully embedded compute platforms to entrylevel display audio systems covering wide spectrum of offerings we are seeing growing demand from our customers for our expanded portfolio of connected car solutions including telematics cyber security overtheair updates and advanced safety features we continue to integrate thirdparty adas offerings while at the same time developing proprietary solutions such as adas object detection vision algorithms and surround view software solutions to name a few in connected services we achieved a new milestone for our overtheair update software business as we speak more than  million vehicles on the road are using harman ota and this number is growing rapidly automakers response for this offering has been overwhelmingly positive not only have we already secured awards from over a dozen oems across three continents half of these awards were secured through other tier s this demonstrates how our ota solution is on its way to become the industry standard these wins are strong evidence that automakers and consumers continue to demand an enhanced incar experience we are addressing this trend and winning in the marketplace with a unique portfolio of solutions across connected car lifestyle audio and connected services before i talk about divisions in more details let me briefly discuss our rapid growth in china which i am extremely proud of you will recall in  our revenue in china was less than  million last year our revenue reached  million that is  cumulative annual growth over the last seven years this quarter we grew our revenue in china over  and we have more than  billion of automotive order backlog needless to say we have been taking market share left and right in china from the competition we are growing our automotive business through imports and with the chinese oems as well we have a very strong foundation in china with more than  people and growing we have two worldclass manufacturing plants multiple stateoftheart research and development centers engineering and design centers china is an important longterm growth market we are winning in automotive and our iconic brands are boosting our consumer and professional growth now let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements lets start with our connected car division which is highlighted on slide seven of our investor presentation during the quarter we secured new and followon awards to provide connected car solutions for customers including audi geely maruti suzuki in india mercedes benz porsche and heavy manufacturer man of volkswagen group during the quarter we launched embedded infotainment solutions in land rover audi toyota porsche and skoda vehicles we also began delivering embedded infotainment solutions to the commercial truck market launching solutions in volkswagen groups man and a scania trucks mans infotainment system developed by harman includes expanded telematics features like digital radio hands free telephony and truck specific navigations the harman system for scania includes innovations such as dual mobile phone connectivity realtime navigation and cloudbased connectivity to fleet management systems im particularly excited about this potential of growth for harman solutions in the commercial fleet  space this is a growing market and provides us with an enormous growth opportunity globally unlike any other tier  building on our momentum and winning telematics business we entered a strategic partnership with att to support the telematics ecosystem harmans telematics control units was selected by att for its mobile broadband accelerator program this precertified solution enables rapid deployment of our offering in the industry we continue to receive accolades for our industryleading innovation winning a ctia wireless award for our peoplebased monitoring software and bestincategory awards from germanys connect magazine for our connected car systems harman was the first company to develop a comprehensive cyber security framework for automakers we double down on research and development investments and acquisitions in the space over the last two years we are setting the industry standard in cyber security and ladies and gentlemen there will be no autonomous car without the protection of cyber security you have heard me say that many times validating our leadership im very proud to share with you first time the following extensive thirdparty evaluations conducted by nhtsa and the university of michigan harmans suite of intrusion detection and mitigation technologies was rated bestinclass that is incredible news for the whole industry now turning to the lifestyle audio division some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on slide eight of the investor presentation audio and sound management are essential parts of the connected car experience and our award winning car audio solutions continue to resonate with drivers leading to another strong quarter of doubledigit growth in the car audio business oems are recognizing the growing importance of audio and sound management solutions both in current vehicle design as well as a critical part of the incar experience in semiautonomous and fully autonomous vehicles this trend is validated by our recent wins and our growing audio backlog i already mentioned the ford expansion on top of that we secured additional awards with lincoln maserati of fca group and toyota during the quarter we launched car audio solutions in toyota lexus and alfa romeo vehicles and halosonic and advanced transducer audio solutions in the mercedes amg class vehicles and now turning to consumer audio we grew doubledigits in the quarter due to strong demand for connected and personalized smart audio products we continue to take market share in fact the most recent data from futuresource confirms harman added over  basis points in market share from early  to summer of  this signals that demand for our awardwinning products is growing and our design technology brands and distribution strategies are working and were not stopping here we continue to bring new awardwinning products to the market at the ifa conference in berlin last september we launched  new products including a new wireless headphone lineup and new waterproof portable speaker series this fall we also launched jbl under armour cobranded wireless heart rate monitoring headphones this was the second product introduced as part of the strategic partnership most recently we announced the jbl playlist audio speaker featuring google cast technology it connects via wifi and streams directly from the cloud to the speaker without requiring bluetooth pairing this obviously simplifies the user experience while dramatically improving the audio quality now turning to the professional solutions division highlighted on slide  of the investor presentation over the last couple of quarters we have been implementing a series of strategic initiatives on the cost side we have completed our european consolidation into hungary and were currently executing additional footprint actions in the us on the topline we are committed to leveraging the strength of our portfolio to better serve our enterprise and entertainment customers through solutions tailored for focused vertical markets as an example harman and ibm announced an exciting strategic partnership last week at the world of watson conference to bring together harmans end to end solutions with ibm watsons cognitive computing capabilities together harman and ibm will integrate artificial intelligence and smart connectivity enabling iot in harmans audio video and lighting products we had a successful pilot running at thomas jefferson hospital in philadelphia that allows patients to use voice commands to alter the temperature in the room turn out the lights or even ask whether their test results have come in yet the voiceactivated assistant can address many of their nonmedical needs freeing up medical professionals when they are needed most additional applications for harman and ibm watson extend to hotel conference room education but you can also imagine the possibilities throughout the enterprise and entertainment markets its very exciting transformational projects like this are exactly why we reorganized our professional solutions division turning specifically to the quarter harmans entertainment and enterprise solutions were selected by ebay corporation dubai parks and resorts london business school and the us presidential inauguration to be held in january as a matter of fact we are starting to see some nice order pickup which will convert into revenue in the coming quarters some notable installations during the quarter include the kennedy center in washington dc sky harbor airport in phoenix and the us naval command center in san diego harman solutions also powered a wide range of high profile special events including the tony award winning musical hamilton g gala in china as well as world tours for bands like metallica and coldplay yes hard rock bands metallica and coldplay we remain confident in our strategy for the professional solutions division our integrated vertical market strategy is gaining traction and we are focused on new product innovation and cost leadership we expect to return to growth on a sustainable basis starting next quarter now turning to the connected services division highlighted on slide  of the investor presentation during the quarter we secured awards to provide software services for honeywell intel and microsoft among others we continue to win business with our cloudbased overtheair software update solutions including awards from daimler and lg electronics in addition harman received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from cisco and market advisory from zinnov in summary we are off to a solid start to deliver on our fiscal  targets we achieved record ebitda and record earnings per share in the quarter added over  billion of new automotive and software services awards and continued to execute on our backlog successfully we remain focused on innovation execution and driving cost leadership which have become hallmark of this companys success and that is applying to all of our businesses now i will turn the call over to our chief financial officer sandy rowland who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc thank you dinesh and good morning everyone let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter as a reminder most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis which excludes acquisition related items restructuring and nonrecurring charges the full reconciliation of our gaap to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning this quarter our revenues were  billion an increase of  compared to the prior year revenue in our connected car division increased  versus the prioryear primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production revenue in our lifestyle audio division increased  compared to the prior year the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher consumer audio sales driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions and higher take rates in car audio revenue in our connected services division increased  compared to a year ago primarily due to higher demand for automotive services while revenue in our professional solutions division decreased  compared to the prior year total company gross margin increased  basis points to  primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost base and productivity initiatives connected car gross margin increased  basis points to  benefiting from better leverage of fixed costs and manufacturing productivity lifestyle audio gross margin increased  basis points to  primarily due to margin expansion in car audio as a result of operating leverage and manufacturing excellence professional solutions gross margin decreased  basis points to  driven by product mix we are seeing manufacturing cost savings from our footprint migration initiatives however as we continue to focus on bringing down our inventory levels in this division we have lower fixed cost absorption impacting gross margin in the nearterm connected services gross margin declined  basis points to  primarily due to higher revenue recognition of highmargin engineering change orders in the prior year we have started to use percentage of completion accounting for significant new contracts which is expected to reduce some of the volatility our sga expense as a percentage of net sales decreased  basis points from the prior year to  connected car sga increased  basis points to  to support growth in awarded business while rd expense in car audio increased to support our expanding backlog lifestyle audio sga decreased  basis points to  due to better leverage on higher sales sga expense in professional solutions increased  basis points compared to the prior year connected services sga expense decreased  basis points to  as a result of footprint migration initiatives related to the integration of red bend finally corporate sga as a percentage of net sales increased by  basis points to  putting it all together our consolidated operating income was  million compared to  million in the prior year a  increase below the line we had an effective tax rate of  which is lower than our guidance of  to  for the full year our guidance takes into account potential tax law changes that we are actively monitoring and at this time we are maintaining our tax rate guidance finally eps was  compared to  in the prior year up  let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation we generated  million of free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operations less capex an improvement of approximately  million driven by strong earnings and effective working capital management during the quarter we were active buyers of our stock we repurchased approximately  shares in the quarter at a cost of  million we now have approximately  million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program and we will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock we are pleased to be off to a good start in fiscal year  we are on track to deliver on our full year guidance and we look forward to speaking to you about our business at upcoming investor conferences and seeing you in january at our ces technology event thank you for your attention dinesh and i are now happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of david lim with wells fargo please proceed with your question david h lim  wells fargo securities llc hi good morning dinesh and sandy congratulations on the quarter dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc good morning david sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc thanks good morning david david h lim  wells fargo securities llc first question on lifestyle lifestyle continues to be strong can you provide us with a walk from last year relative to revenues and margins and what were the major factors to the performance this quarter dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc sure david as you know we have been investing heavily in software solutions in the division across both business units whether its consumer audio or car audio our business is really changing quite a bit it used to be a pure product business now we are supplying software solutions and in fact interestingly before i give you a little break down our connected services team has really been teaming up with our lifestyle division to bring in necessary software competence to change consumer product to cloudbased smart speakers smart devices same thing we are doing in car audio so back to your question we have roughly – this division is split pretty much equally in both but we saw very good development our consumer audio business grew nearly  and our car audio business grew  plus in this quarter which we are extremely pleased with david h lim  wells fargo securities llc got you thank you can you give us a little more color on premium audio demand in china given – it seems like its a burgeoning market market take rates on both the consumer and the automotive side seems to be really low compared to the developed markets and also on the order book the  billion that you posted in q a little bit more detail between audio and infotainment would be very helpful dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc sure so first of all the backlog is sort of split equally  almost  billion and so infotainment and another  billion came from car audio which we are very pleased with because our car audio business is our profit leader when it comes to proliferation of car audio take rates yes of course china starting points are very low lowsingledigit penetration if you look at whole china so there of course chinese consumers or i would say asian consumers are very brand hungry they want american iconic brands to be in their car and our car company customers continue to find overwhelmingly market research that branded car audio is helping them differentiate their own cars having said that we are actually seeing the penetration of car audio across the world i mentioned to you we expanded our relationship with ford which is a fantastic news its a very good business with ford now we replaced a competitor at highend lincoln we also replaced a competitor for a cross carline globally for ford worldwide with both brands coming from harman in addition we won business with other german and asian automakers for car audio and you saw that i was extremely pleased to share with you our order backlog for car audio the book and has gone  ratio which means our future is even better margins and our backlogs are getting better every quarter every year david h lim  wells fargo securities llc and just quickly can you size the win with ford on the  and any kind of commentary on your infotainment system obviously we have one of your competitors that are launching a new as they call stateoftheart infotainment system i think in the first quarter and they are going to show that at ces any idea of how your best infotainment matches up with their new product that they are going to launch thank you dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc yeah thank you david first of all our infotainment award is fairly new that is a competitor replacement by the time it goes into car production i think they are sometime away probably  months to  months away so you will see that – and this is for display audio thats a brandnew category which harman is growing into when it comes to car audio win thats actually a very sizable win for us one of the largest wins we have ever seen but there seems to be a trend we are seeing that cross carline this is almost like a single source solution for car audio whenever car companies are deciding and a stickiness is very high in that business so all in all very good and you will also see from us in ces some incredible product launches across compute platform across telematics cyber security adas solutions and of course you will see some sound management cuttingedge technologies operator our next question comes from the line of brian johnson with barclays please proceed with your question brian a johnson  barclays capital inc yes good morning dinesh and team dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc good morning brian  brian a johnson  barclays capital inc a couple of strategic questions the first is around kind of the take rates in embedded nav and coming back to that second maybe just thinking about that new project in voice in general so on the first question chrysler which we do know is  going away but interesting what they are doing in the market is offering the big screen uconnect as we understand it as with or without embedded nav which could take away some of what we – the question is that i can see the consumer appeal there for younger people who dont believe in embedded nav and believe in their smartphones especially as now google lets you preload your local maps reducing data usage but you know as you think about what theyve done do you see that spreading to other oems and then also is that good news for harman in terms of maybe increasing the take rates at the high end by taking a way the objection of i dont need embedded nav or bad news because even if that happens there is loss of markup on the dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc good brian let me sort of bring it all together so first of all whats happening as you have heard before that if you look at the full pie the whole market so nearly  of the business the bottom half of the pie has been nothing or simple amfm radio top half of the pie was split equally  into fully embedded navigationbased infotainment systems and another one was display audio which means to put simply – simply put its full embedded system minus navigation so you can bring your own kind of thing what were witnessing the bottom half of the pie is very fast moving into the both quarters of the top pie which means either going towards display audio or going into embedded audio my firm belief supported by big oems worldwide is that you will see fast migration at equal pace but very soon in couple of years you will see even display audio consumers will start to migrate towards fully embedded because its not clear that if cars are going to be autonomous or semiautonomous you cant run them from a handheld device this is a post device era we are talking about very distributed strong compute platform which harman is leader in would actually be part of the car embedded system with cloud applications so thats what we are seeing and were happy that we are playing on both sides of the display audio as well as embedded audio and winning on both sides then you also know what else is happening is ota the overtheair update technology is something which is just emerging and we have the unique patented technology with  years of rd and we have won more than a dozen oems including fca every single cross carline fca we received an order for our systems as well as non harman systems to be updated by our ota technology and as far as the large screen brian that seems to be sort of personal choice and more and more people are asking for it therefore display unit is becoming a very important part the user interface the contextual and smart user interface the display devices display units will play a bigger role consolidation of industry here is even likely to happen more because nearly onethird of cog cost of goods sold is getting to a close to display unit we are supplying large display units as you mentioned uconnect that is a harman system – has been it won actually in  best infotainment system award by consumer report and we are seeing similarly in our mercedes s class bmw  series audi a those cars were also seeing largescreen and i guess asian consumers would definitely opt for largescreen so i think that seems to be the trend brian a johnson  barclays capital inc but in terms of the take rates and sort of your cpd  if a customer – end customer were to come in the showroom and leave with a uconnect system without embedded nav does that affect the revenue or ebitda you would be booking dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc so interesting you raised that let me clarify one more point whether you win display audio or full embedded system the only difference is navigation which is a component of multiple parts come together to create compute platform so we are providing choices of using any nav whether you use d highdefinition maps which we supply to our customers or you can use a simple d google maps or what have you so choices are there available to you but imagine its still the whole multimedia the tuner technology the handsfree telephony the interface with other ecus in the car that still has to be done even for display audio and thats what our system for ford is all about highly integrated display audio largescreen but it still would have a choice and eventually this system can also integrate on board navigation or you can bring it your own and we are gaining ground and as far as the penetration of the take rates traditionally we have seen about  basis point yearoveryear improvement in take rate whether its the display audio or fully embedded we are playing on both and we are seeing same take rate improvement in fact slightly more for us because we are working with the customers where the take rates are higher so i think run rate for harman for take rate is pretty strong with nearly a  billion  billion of order backlog i think we have perhaps the fastest opportunity to grow this business in the next  to  years thank you brian operator our next question comes from the line of ryan brinkman with jpmorgan please proceed with your question ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning thanks for taking my question dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc hi ryan ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc i would like to delve a bit deeper into the prebreakout margins at lifestyle during the quarter i know that revenue rose materially and so operating leverage was clearly a big driver but it seems like the margin rose considerably more than that which would be ordinarily implied by historical incremental at the division can you may be shed some more light on the manufacturing excellence that sandy referred to in her comments what that is whether its sustainable et cetera and then if whether were anything of more onetime nature potentially benefiting the quarter sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc yeah thanks ryan i think that the good and positive margin expansion that we have see in lifestyle is sustainable where we saw the greatest margin expansion this quarter was in our car audio division and i think a lot of it comes from some of the synergies we got from the bang  olufsen acquisition last year when we acquired them we moved their manufacturing out from denmark into our manufacturing operation in hungary and now that those operations are running together were getting very good synergies there but if i look at the margin levels they were right about the same place that they were in q so quarter sequentially for car audio weve seen the same pattern for the past six months dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc and also ryan remember the scale is becoming even bigger for us we are the largest supplier of car audio and were becoming perhaps the largest but i would say niche player in consumer audio and were gaining ground because of the scale and the fast pace of innovation were bringing ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc so margins are sustainable i would even feel good about our sustainability of topline were feeling good about what we have in the pipeline ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc thats great thank you and then just last question again on lifestyle more about the topline this time i know youre doing a lot new on the car audio side like with lincoln et cetera but just curious if youre able to share at all the relative growth rates between car audio and consumer what i think our home and multimedia et cetera as i know youve got some drivers there too with under armour et cetera sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc yeah ryan i think we shared the prepared numbers earlier the growth in consumer was about  in the quarter and the growth in car audio was about  in the quarter ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay and is there anything to keep in mind as the year progresses about the cadence of the various growth rates sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc i think one thing to keep in mind as we look at the seasonality q is the largest quarter for our consumer business and we think were going to have a very strong holiday season ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay very helpful thanks a lot operator our next question comes from the line of patrick nolan with deutsche bank please proceed with your question patrick nolan  deutsche bank securities inc good morning everyone good quarter dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc hi patrick good morning thank you patrick nolan  deutsche bank securities inc just a followup on ryans question about the seasonality so im assuming some of this consumer lifestyle strength is likely driven by you guys talked about in the past some of the upgrade cycles so im assuming iphone  maybe drove some of the strength in this quarter im just kind of reinforcing your confidence about the holiday season so do think – is the second half gross going to be a good deal lower in that business the way youre thinking about it right now dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc so the way you should see that business yearoveryear there is a clear seasonality second quarter is the strongest quarter in this business but first quarter this year we actually were very pleased with incredible growth  and we expect q to be similar or even better second half is slightly weaker because – just for seasonality but we think our strength is not just coming because of what you just mentioned with the company but we are seeing incredible penetration of smart portables we actually became number one supplier in the world by gfk a market tracking agency in smart portable wireless speakers and we are seeing similar growth now in our smart headphones some of the headphones are even now updated overtheair with a firmware software so incredible knowledge we are bringing so under armour is the third piece as an example the strategic partnerships like under armour in consumer audio or ibm watson in professional audio will continue to bring more momentum so under armour is a great brand we are developing jointly products the product which we just launched called inear heart rate monitoring let me stress that this is one of a kind product its a military grade heart rate monitoring absolutely accurate so this is designed for athletes but priced for massmarket so we expect it to also take off very nicely and you will see some incredible product launches at ces in january in las vegas so we feel good about the division to continue the great momentum they have patrick nolan  deutsche bank securities inc thanks thats very helpful and just on the connected car division the growth there was just slightly lower than the full year target i think it implies is there going to be any lumpiness of that growth this year that we should be thinking about as we kind of go through the year or do you expect to kind of to steadily move more towards that kind of ish growth youre targeting dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc yeah so first of all we are actually well within what we guided the market we guided between  to  and we are right in there and when it comes to cyclicity typically our second and fourth quarters are the strongest quarters having said that we are very pleased that q came in where it came in and what excites me most is the margin expansion continuation you might have noticed that we are very margin driven management we will not negotiate anything but for margins and for last three years in connected car alone we have added  basis points of margin improvement and q is another strong indication of where were headed so allinall we expect to hit our fullyear guidance for this division and very good margin development operator our next question comes from the line of david leiker with baird please proceed with your question joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker hi good morning this is joe vruwink for david sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc yes dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc hi joe how are you morning joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker good you talk about being on track to hit fullyear guidance but then there is comments like pro turning around lifestyle margin staying strong being on track within connected car so it seems like you are tracking above where guidance stands as things sit today is there a mitigating factor in the equation we need to consider dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc joe first of all a great question let me start with this we are very pleased with our q development it gives us strong confidence to hit our full year guidance we have provided you in august listen its still early in the year for us to review to even increase the guidance if we were to do that we need one more quarter right now if i can be honest with you i feel good about the highend of our guidance where we are tracking so thats all i can share i think all four divisions are developing well professional division you heard me say that q should be a growth quarter for us and then from there on we should see sustainable growth development so we feel good about and connected services you also mentioned for connected services typically our q is the most strongest quarter but we still came in  growth in constant currency and we guided  for the fullyear so for all four divisions we feel good about but all in all for company we could be in a better place after q joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great and then a few questions on your backlog sorry if i missed it can you say how much is new or conquest of the  billion in new awards versus replacement and then the  stepup in your award activity relative to todays connected car revenue base if i think about  thats probably a threeyear future value if you will thinking about the timing of when those will launch if i do a compound growth rate on that thats maybe a high singledigit rate of growth is that the right rate of growth to think about for your infotainment business sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc so joe let me take the first part of your question you asked about what part of the new awards that we announced in the quarter were new and which ones were competitive replacements so if you break it down if you look at our car audio awards obviously the ford award that we announced is a pure competitive replacement and if you look at the close to  billion of new awards in connected car its split about  dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc  competitive replacement  new awards i dont how – when you say the growth the way we like you to see we are running about  book and bill which means our orders are ahead of revenue by a factor of – multiplier of  for infotainment connected car compute platform and for car audio book and bill is  that means the orders are outpacing revenue by a factor of two so all in all we are running our automotive business the book and bill is  so that gives us tremendous confidence for the next several years as we guided you for threeyear and fiveyear outlook we feel good about that operator our next question comes from the line of tavis mccourt with raymond james please proceed with your question tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc hey dinesh and sandy its tavis dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc hi tavis good morning tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc thanks for taking my questions two of them dinesh first i think this will help kind of get around some of the questions earlier you won quite a bit of display audio in the last several quarters toyota ford i think you mentioned at least one of the awards this quarter with display audio so based on that knowledge do you expect any material change in your gross margin or operating margin profile in the connected car division as that makes changes towards display audio going forward and then secondly i was wondering if you could discuss a little bit the kind of the sensitivity to the model if we get a decline in auto production next year given investor concerns right now maybe a bit of a explanation of how the cost structure has changed since the last recession if youve done any sensitivity analysis on if you were to get a  decline in production what that would mean for the business and cost structure thanks dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc sure great tavis let me answer the first question and maybe sandy will give more color on the second well first of all display audio or embedded audio as a brand margins continue to improve as you have heard us say and we have validated we are very margin driven management team we will walk away from business if it does not meet our margin requirements and we have done it and it wont be the last time we will do it in future because theres plenty of business out there yes we are market leader with  of the world market and rest  sharing  so we win obviously a lot of business but we also walk away from others having said that display audio is a good business yes it meets our margin requirements its not dilutive actually its accretive all in all when it comes to sensitivity to the market production as we guided for the full   to  actually that – the production guidance still holds because we guided china to be around   china is tracking over  we guided europe to be right around  to  european came in slightly weaker us is holding so all in all global production for our fiscal year is in line and we feel good about our fullyear guidance hypothetically if production it becomes flat or even lower than that i think thats where the cost advantage and the baseline cost comes in ill let sandy give some color sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc yes tavis just first on sensitivities for your model i think the way it could break it down is if you look at our portfolio of businesses remember that we have business thats outside of the automotive space so overall about  of our revenues across connected car and car audio come from automotive so its about  of our company exposure which is right around  billion so each point of production is worth somewhere between  million and  million to the top line and if you look at it from a leverage standpoint weve typically said that we get about  operating leverage on the upside and it works that way on the downside as well typically between  to  and if it stays down longer we will continue to take cost actions to mitigate any of the erosion operator our next question comes from the line of brad erickson pacific crest securities please proceed with your question brad erickson  pacific crest securities hi guys thanks for taking my questions dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc hi brad good morning brad erickson  pacific crest securities just a couple first i know historically i guess the margin flowthrough on the connected car business has been a little bit lumpy depending on some i guess more random timings of things like rd reimbursements et cetera can you help us with just i guess the linearity that youre thinking about the margin flowthrough as we go through fiscal  here in the connected car business sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc yes okay dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc go ahead sandy sandra e rowland  harman international industries inc no i was going to say brad that we do guided that the upside leverage is about  but we do tell you that there is some volatility from quartertoquarter and thats partially why we dont give quarterly guidance from a connected car standpoint we do like to see favorable margins in the first half of the year because you do have the apr impact hitting us in the third quarter so thats something to keep in mind but if you look over the past several years weve been seeing consistent dropdown of around  brad erickson  pacific crest securities got it thats super helpful and then just on the professional business any kind of updated thoughts there historically i think youve seemed a bit more open the last few quarters to maybe divesting that asset at some point just given that there are fewer cost synergies versus the oem business can you provide any update as to how youre thinking about the recovery and future of that business within the harman portfolio thanks dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc so consistently what we said in the last couple of quarters this business is going through some transformation and we are very vigorously taking our strategic actions three areas the three buckets which i know how to do well in our company that is cost leadership new product introduction and go to market strategy all three are totally locked on theres a new leader of the division who brings tremendous sense of urgency we already consolidated our european footprint which is flowing through our bottomline almost  basis point improvement in the margins this year which we confirmed to you last time this year we have already announced and were working on execution of couple of us sites which will also add another  basis point to  basis point improvement once we are done by end of this year on top of that brandnew many new products would be launched and youll see some of them coming out at namm which is north america professional audio society january  so new products being launched to fulfill the solution needs for enterprise and entertainment another great example for that was ibm watson the strategic partnership how we are enabling iot in professional audiovideo lighting first time any pro company is doing thats harman and third go to market sales training for our own people and our channels distributors and reps is undergoing very well were seeing traction in fact the orders we have booked in q are very encouraging to me and the way we see it october sales is already in so we have little bit of visibility q should be a growth quarter and from this point on you should expect growth and in the end i would say this business is a great business has been good business for harman and we expect this business to return to a doubledigit margin soon and then from there on be a good contributor to the company operator our next question comes from the line of joseph spak with rbc capital markets please proceed jacob hughes  rbc capital markets llc hi this is jacob hughes on for joe i just had a couple of strategic questions nhtsa recently put forth their vehicle cyber security guidance i wonder if you had any initial take on that and what are the opportunities for harman and then secondly how does qnx aiming for tier  status and what happens if other software players get involved how do you think about that dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc wonderful let me take the qnx i mean the cyber security first than qnx so cyber security unless you missed my opening comments i shared with you one of the breaking news that nhtsa together with university of michigan conducted a thirdparty research evaluation of available cyber security intrusion detection and mitigation solutions and harman ranked number one absolutely best in class and this is extremely encouraging for me personally because we actually doubled down two years ago when no one talked about cyber security we said without cyber security you should not even dream of autonomous or semiautonomous as soon as you connect a car youve got bad guys coming in your car so were actually leading that space and just like we did for qnx making a standard were doing for ota red bend technology and we think our cyber security will become industrystandard so we are very happy about it and we have number of customers right now in rfq phase where our cyber security would be integral part of the offerings turning to qnx qnx is one of the several operating systems out there and harman used to own qnx and we have incredible competence and we use qnx its still in some of our systems same time we are also using linux we are using android and were using hybrid approaches so we wanted to be totally agnostic and we feel very good about we are developing very large multibilliondollar programs in android as well as linux and qnx jacob hughes  rbc capital markets llc okay thank you dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of steven fox with cross research please proceed steven fox  cross research llc thanks good morning i just had one big picture question i was just curious given the pretty big upside in the quarter versus what we all were thinking and you guys mentioned market share gains across different channels as well as different product categories is there anything within that you could highlight maybe the top things that drove that those share gains whether its roadmap advancements that are picking up steam or channel relationships that are gaining ground im just here where you would see the internal momentum during the quarter thanks a lot dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc sure its a great question and it is a strategic question which i hope gets asked all the time because i think we have clearly broken out from the pack of other tier s so in connected car what is differentiating harman from rest is were the only company who has the most powerful compute platform with wide integration capability of multiple ecu supplied by various other tier s and were the one who worked agnostically with all silicon or memory suppliers whether its a intel samsung ti nvidia qualcomm nxp and we have – we create we work with them design the unique solution for automotive and then we deploy that in addition we are also the company who has broken out in telematic space we have been doing telematics for multiple generations in germany and in the united states now we have launched very first order industrys first i repeat gatewaybased telematics for a german oem which we believe will become another trend and the third is cyber security and adas solutions cyber security we are doubling down and also ota we have clear market lead on that we have one  car companies already six or seven of them through directly through harman and others through other competitors and adas you heard me say we integrate so the best of the best whether its coming from mobileye or from somewhere else and we also develop our own object detection vision algorithms and the camera  surround view implementing in asia as well as the german automakers so thats the differentiation in connected car in car audio our key differentiation is having the access to the worlds best brand that is differentiating the top luxury cars from the other premium cars and then when it comes to creating nextgeneration solutions i mentioned imagine youre sitting in a shared economy in a car where three other passengers you dont know you are sitting with you will need to have your own individual sound video zone thats harmans patented technology so we are doing road noise cancellation were doing ambient noise cancellation were doing engine auto cancellation we are doing individual sound zone so combine it with unique marketleading iconic brand and sound management systems that put us apart from anybody – and by the way i repeat were the only company who had that power of car audio and sound management and connected car no other tier  can boast that operator and there are no questions – further questions at this time ill turn the conference back over to you dinesh c paliwal  harman international industries inc this has been a great  great quarter and id like to thank you all for your continued interest in harmans story this is my tenth year and this management team is very stable and take great pride in doing what we do well that is execution we dont worry about strategy every day we have a great strategy but we execute well we take great pride in saying we are margin expansion company and we take great pride in innovation so with that i would say to our owners our shareholders our investors and our sell side and buy side analyst community thank you for taking our story and supporting our story and very eloquently extending it to other people who dont quite understand as new customers and we remain very excited about our story we are a continued growth story we have been and we hope we are off to a very good start in fiscal  thank you all and well be talking and meeting with many of you over the next days or so operator ladies and
