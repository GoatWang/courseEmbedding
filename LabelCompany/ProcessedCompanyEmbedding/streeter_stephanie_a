president and ceo of banta corp she recently spoke with industryweek about manufacturing longevity leadership and the competitive spirit q how would you describe your leadership style im very direct in how i approach things so what you see is what you get theres very little politics or gamesmanship its very much right down the fairway i like to be involved  not to the tune of micromanaging but i ask a lot of questions and i read incessantly q athletics is a big part of your background how has it impacted your leadership style there are so many ways from knowing what it means to win as a team  how you have each others backs when youre on a team meaning someone can make a mistake but part of your job is to be there to make sure the mistake isn’t catastrophic that you dont lose the game as a result how to win as a team and lose as a team is very important and its not just about good sportsmanship its about how you require each other to reach different levels that maybe you didnt or weren’t able to reach by yourself and that whole competitive spirit when you are in business you are out there to win theres no two ways about it how you win is as important as winning so is the character that you displayed and the sportsmanship that you have but you are definitely in it to win women scarce in leadership roles » next print reprints favorite email tweet please log in or

from  to  streeter holds a ba from stanford university and is a former fouryearstarter on stanford universitys womens basketball team serving as captain her junior and senior years she is married and lives with her husband and twins born in  in the toledo area how has your life experience made you the leader you are today growing up in a family of six children and a virtually lifelong involvement in team sports at pretty high levels has taught me the value of competition and team add to that a heavy dose of intuition and curiosity ive always been focused on learning and doing what it takes to win in an environment where it is both about your own performance but also those around you how has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at libbey every experience has been a learning opportunity from the discipline and intrapreneurial environment at xerox and avery dennison to the entrepreneurial spirit at idealab and the automation consultants to the rigor of the printing industry to the broad scope at the us olympic committee ive taken bits and pieces from each organization to learn and grow as a leader i have worked for and with great people my lifelong involvement in sports also defined and influenced my leadership style what have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at libbey when i arrived at libbey i spent the first four or five months listening to our associates learning the business visiting the facilities and talking to as many people as i could internally and externally i was fascinated by the history the rich heritage and the level of expertise and commitment inside the company that was certainly a highlight i was inheriting a gem a crown jewel in the tabletop world other than typical challenges of running a business id say there has been some hesitancy by some to embrace change the company had decades of success our new strategy and leadership approach were a departure from how people were accustomed to operating we are making progress every day but ill be truthful id like to be moving faster what advice can you offer to women who want a career in your industry the glass making industry has been around for thousands of years  my advice is try new things as there are many opportunities to be more relevant this may sound a bit flip  its not meant to be  but i encourage people to fail fast i want to try new ideas pilot them and learn quickly i played the guard position when on the basketball at stanford and throughout all the sports i played i learned that if youre trying new things if youre leaving it all out on the field youre going to turn the ball over youre going to make mistakes if you are going to be disruptive in the industry my advice is to effectively and quickly recover from your mistakes and dont internalize them learn from them move on to be better the next time what is the most important lesson youve learned in your career to date most important lesson  respect the people who are on your team learn from them understand them engage them talent is one of the most powerful levers that exist in an organization an effective leader must know how to attract develop and motivate their team i believe that the most successful organizations are a blend of experienced professionals and new hires with fresh perspectives the key is to inspire teamwork and collaboration at all levels of the organization how do you maintain a worklife balance this issue is more than just striking a balance its more about being present in all aspects of your life my approach is similar to our companys strategy own the moment our products play a central role in lifes moments we help people shape and define memories at every occasion from a quiet dinner at home to a wedding celebration there are special moments that can be cherished and celebrated ive taken the same approach when im with my children they are my focus and we have special moments every day if we are visiting family taking a vacation or just heading to karate practice i try hard to be in the moment i enjoy every day whether its the joy of being a mom or the positive feeling i get when i see our associates who get it i get energized from both my personal and professional life as an early childhood friend once said enjoy life you could have been a barnacle what do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace from my perspective i never felt limited because i was a female if there was a boys club i looked beyond it didnt acknowledge it my parents instilled in me at a young age to be the best at whatever i wanted to be or chose to pursue however in some work cultures i have seen that women can face penalties for doing things that lead to success as an example a man may be considered effective at doing what it takes to get the job done while a woman may be considered bossy i never let that realm of thinking hinder me nor do i ever judge my team that way at the end of the day i really believe an individuals success  male or female  depends on their ability to perform successfully in their environment and culture a leader has to be able to deliver results motivate and inspire how has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life there hasnt been a single outstanding mentor instead there have been dozens of mentors who have influenced me based on their advice and guidance as well as insights that i have absorbed over the years ive developed my personal list of four cs here are the key traits that i believe have made a difference in my personal and professional life any leader must have character im very direct in how i approach things im straightforward  no politics no drama ive had mentors who excelled because they were straightforward i saw how powerful it worked and nobody really wants to work for a jerk confidence as eleanor roosevelt said the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams this requires confidence not arrogance but trust belief faith and conviction that a chosen path or course of action is the best without that leaders dont lead they manage creativity is essential even those of us who arent in explicitly creative fields must come up with new ideas and insights and leaders especially must be able to connect the dots in ways that others may not be able to finally courage im not sure if this is a quality of mind or spirit but leaders need courage to address issues to handle conflict and to challenge the status quo maybe this behavior was inspired or honed through sports its always been a strength for me and i think its a strength of all good leaders which other female leaders do you admire and why ive always admired madeleine albright i actually had the opportunity to meet her last year at a bloomberg conference shes incredibly bright has been extremely effective in every aspect of her career shes influential and confident i admire how shes dealt with sensitive and controversial issues  shes direct and thoughtful a tough negotiator for sure but always confident of who she was and comfortable in her own skin what do you want libbey to accomplish in the next year its an exciting time to be at libbey i want us to continue our transformation and enable every associate to own their moment we have an aggressive growth agenda in the years ahead if we can be bold work collaboratively and focus on our goals every day will be a celebration follow laura dunn on twitter wwwtwittercomlauraemilyd laura dunn social media and communications professional founder and editor
