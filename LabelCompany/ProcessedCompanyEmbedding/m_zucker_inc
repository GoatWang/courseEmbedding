capacitors power factor correction capacitors store and redistribute reactive power  when a capacitor assembly is connected to an electrical system containing an inductive load will require less reactive power from the utility  low power factor caused by inductive loads results in increased line losses and possible surcharges or penalties billed by electric utility providers myron zucker inc

system the th harmonic is  hz the total amount of harmonics in a power system is referred to as total harmonic distortion thd nonlinear loads such as adjustable speed drives pulse converters uninterruptible power supplies etc are likely causes of damaging harmonics in your system when present in a power system harmonics often result in higher voltages and currents this condition is known
