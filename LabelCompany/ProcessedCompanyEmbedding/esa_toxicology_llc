doctor about privacy policy faq terms of use vampire lab turns to old trick to grow business physician owned labs cardiobriefonestop source for cardiology news and links home about vampire lab turns to old trick to grow business physician owned labs february   by larry husten  comments updated true health diagnostics the new laboratory that bought the assets and adopted the business model of the disgraced and bankrupt laboratory company health diagnostic laboratory hdl is turning to some old unethical and illegal tricks to grow its business as i’ve reported previously one key to the spectacular growth of hdl laboratory involved surreptitious bribes to doctors– often in the form of excessive processing and handling ph fees in the wake of the government investigation of hdl and the company’s subsequent collapse this strategy is no longer viable now evidence has emerged that true health is turning to the old trick of physician owned laboratories to incentivize its physician customers with few exceptions physician owned laboratories are illegal dating to the late s the stark law prohibits physicians from owning laboratories and other business entities from which they can benefit from selfreferral “the real problem” one industry veteran told me “is the incentives and selling clinical tools and services not as a way to benefit patient outcomes but as a means to increase cash flow” rumors have been circulating for months that true health was engaging in various schemes to give financial incentives to doctors i now have documents that offer an indepth glimpse at the details of one of these schemes connecting the dots… the documents originate from travis boulware a managing partner at boulevard endeavors llc “we are a company of passionate drug test management people” the company’s website proclaims in bold letters though the rest of the website is an empty shell boulware formerly worked at ameritox a company that paid the us government  million in fines because you guessed it the company bribed doctors to use its tests it is probably not a coincidence that chris grottenthaler the ceo of true health previously served as the vp of finance for ameritox ameritox  which specialized in drug testing was a “pioneer” in the use of bribes to entice doctors to use their tests i received a copy of an email sent by boulware to a doctor offering the doctor boulware’s help in setting up “physician owned entities including laboratories” this email shows how true health and its partners have cooked up a toxic stew that combines the ameritox drug testing scheme with the hdl cardiovascular risk testing scheme and additional services “the email describes at least five different ways the physician can order diagnostic procedures and lab tests for a range of issues such as pain management drugsofabuse testing wellness and heartcardiovascular function” explained robert michel editorinchief of the dark report an intelligence service covering the clinical laboratory industry “the email further states that the physician can generate additional revenue per patient by adding these lab tests and diagnostic procedures to the medical practice—although that physician has never determined there is the clinical need for these lab tests and diagnostics before now” “this email illustrates how these companies are willing to push compliance with federal and state laws that define illegal types of inducements and kickbacks” he continued “these companies cannot profit unless the physician decides to begin ordering these lab tests and diagnostic procedures which are often medically unnecessary not only is this a violation of the federal and state antikickback laws but they put patients at risk of harm while increasing the cost of healthcare” in the email boulware wrote to the doctor click here to read the entire email message “within the primary care scope of practice it is common to send out many services without seeing any revenue back after my review i can present a few options to consider including but not limited to physician owned entity inhouse simple screening devices and possibly looking at how diseases are managed from a clinic organizational structure” the documents boulware included a number of documents that provide important details about the scheme there is a nondisclosure agreement about the lab company called esa toxicology llc in which the doctor is being invited to invest for the purpose of referring specimens in the kickback scheme a chart showing the return on investment of a cardiac testing device the max pulse showing that doctors can make over  a year giving the test to  patients every day it should be noted here that there is currently no guidelineaccepted indication for the widespread use of this device in clinical practice a pro forma spreadsheet showing the business model of the toxicology testing physicianowned lab this suggests that the physician can earn nearly  each month by referring his or her own patients to the lab a sample results form from true health diagnostics it should be noted that these broad panels like the very similar panels sold by hdl have absolutely no legitimate indication in common clinical practice the point of all these documents is to demonstrate the financial benefits of these tests and devices to the doctor completely lost in the process is any concern for the patient update february – in an apparent response to the letter sent by boulware to the physician a lawyer representing true health diagnostics sent a cease and desist letter to boulware in the letter true health denies any association with the revenue opportunity schemes proposed by boulware or any affiliation between boulware’s company and true health the law firm representing true health is perkins coie according to the letterhead on the letter to boulware the lawyer’s name and address is redacted on the copy i received according to an article in richmond bizsense a perkins coie lawyer eric walker represented robert bradford johnson one of the owners of bluewave the sales team closely tied to hdl true health has stated that the owners of bluewave have no association with true health but as the bizsense article reported johnson represented true health at a trade show and true health a private company has not disclosed the names of its owners as i reported recently the owners of bluewave have had their assets frozen by the government   previous stories about hdl and true health diagnostics beyond kickbacks more questions about unnecessary cardiovascular biomarker

dinar says july   at  pm any response to jed’s question i’ve had several physician friends mention this group reply kathy says september   at  pm i am reporting to fraud dept as i continued to investigate a nd doctor of mine sent urine to this lab april of  my ins paid them k kathy says september   at  pm i’ve lost all respect for my doctor i just received a bill for …for a routine urine test to make sure that i am not on drugs before refilling my prescriptions complete and utter bs my lawyer is getting involved reply tina k ing says october   at  pm i have not got any bills from thd however they did file the claim to my insurance company in the amount of  the claim was denied i was shocked to see the claim when i saw the claim on my insurance website i mean this was for routine physical checkup how can a routine physical checkup be this high reply email protected says january   at  pm i googled the company to learn there are a lot of folks getting bills this month for ridiculous amounts for drug screening mine totaled over  for urine testing reply stephani espinoza says january   at  pm how can we report esa toxicology llc and the pa that ordered this test i had a routine urine sample and they billed at  and my insurance paid  now they are trying to say i owe  utter and complete garbage i did reach out to my doctors office and they are saying i am not responsible for the balance due hmm seems shady to me i reached out to esa and they are going to mail me a hardship form i did reach out to my insurance company about this claim and they said they would forward it on to the fraud dept but i never heard back  the rep said there wasn’t much they could do because they had already paid the lab reply camille j brown says january   at  pm i’m hearing more and more about these physician kickbacks ironically what is supposed to help them though illegal will actually drive their business away altogether as people like myself will begin to avoid the industry entirely reply connie davis says january   at  pm i went to lifestream health center in coppell texas because of fatigue and a friend recommended themthey said they were going to do a more extensive blood work up… they billed my insurance company over  for  test… they tested everything – they ordered the blood test through true health diagnostics i believe there must be kick backs or something going on i am appalled at this this was uncalled for and if they had informed me that it was this expensive i would have never done it total collusion reply kellie b says april   at  pm i am so thankful for your article i work for a very rural critical access hospital we have been struggling financially and have been approached by several vultures who would like to provide us with a “joint opportunity” in essence it could save our hospital i believe that they specifically search out hospitals that are in dire straits to do their dirty work…the billing portion something didn’t seem right about their business model but i couldn’t quite put my finger on it thank you for filling in the missing pieces we may go under but at least we will still have our integrity reply leave a
