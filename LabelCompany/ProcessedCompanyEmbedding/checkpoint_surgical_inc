checkpoint in several surgical scenarios for those of you unfamiliar with checkpoint we would suggest you first watch “checkpoint commentary” by the internationally recognized hand surgeon dr scott

reliable and reproducible reduction of neural scarring after peripheral nerve suture an experimental study about collagen membrane and autologous vein wrapping l mathieu c adam j legagneux p bruneval e masmejean chirurgie de la main  purpose the effects of a collagen membranecovatm ortho and a technique of autologous vein wrapping on scar formation after peripheral nerve suture are investigated methods fortyeight sciatic nerves from wistar rats were transected and repaired then allocated to a control group c n   and two experimental groups in group a n   the repair line was covered by the collagen membrane and in group b n   the repair line was wrapped by an external jugular venous graft primary endpoints macroscopic evaluation and histologic evaluation of extraneural and intraneural fibrosis key findings three months later it was observed that adhesions in the surrounding tissues were significantly less in groups acollagen membrane and bvein wrap compared to group c control and significantly less in group a than in the group b in group a the sciatic nerve could be detached from the surrounding muscle tissue or was wrapped in a thin fibrous translucent and easily cleavable tissue after  months the collagen membrane was completely resorbed in all cases histological analysis revealed no significant reduction of extraneural or intraneural scar tissue in groups a or b compared to group c however intraneural fibrosis was significantly less in the group a than in the group b conclusion it was concluded that the collagen membrane was effective in reducing neural scar formation after peripheral nerve suture autologous vein wrapping also showed a favorable effect in this indication despite less successful histological outcomes comparison of a collagen membrane versus a fibrin sealant after a peroneal nerve section and repair a functional and histological study v pertici j laurin t marqueste p decherchi acta neurochir wien   purpose to date fibrin sealant is considered to be one of the most effective substitutes to prevent postoperative fibrosis and to limit neuroma formation after nerve suture because fibrin sealant presents a number of drawbacks more suitable techniques should be considered the aim of this study was to functionally and histologically compare the efficiency of a fibrin sealant to a resorbable semipermeable porcine type i collagen membranecovatmortho after a peroneal nerve lesion and repair on rats methods rats were divided into four groups  a sham group n in which surgery was performed without damaging the nerve  a lesion group n in which the nerve was cut and immediately sutured without additional treatment  a membrane group n in which a collagen membrane was wrapped around the lesion site and  a glue group n in which the peroneal nerve was coated by fibrin sealant peroneal functional index pfi kinematic analysis of locomotion muscular atrophy axonal regrowth and irritant ranking score irs were performed during three months postsurgery primary endpoints the peroneal functional index kinematic analysis of movement muscle weight measurements and histology inflammatory reactions histopathological analysis axonal regrowth key findings our results indicate that at the third month postsurgery no difference in both the functional recovery and the histological measurement was observed between groups however no deleterious effect was observed following the use of the collagen membrane indeed the porcine membrane was wellintegrated into the host tissue with no noticeable foreign body reaction at three months postsurgery conclusion our preliminary results highlight the fact that the collagen membrane could be used as an alternative to fibrin sealant in peripheral nerve repair surgery indeed animals in which the collagen membrane was used to wrap the lesion site exhibited similar functional and histological results as animals in which a fibrin sealant was used to coat the lesion the greatest advantage of this membrane is that it could be used as a drug delivery device regulated by its degradation rate cova™ orthonerve surgical videos intraoperative videos demonstrating cova™ orthonerve
