loss potential might increase inflation in commodity prices could also generate price movements which the strategies might successfully follow   the partnership should be able to close out its open trading positions and liquidate its holdings relatively quickly and at market prices except in unusual circumstances this typically permits the partnership to limit losses as well as reduce market exposure on short notice should its strategies indicate doing so as a commodity pool the partnership maintains an extremely large percentage of its assets in cash which it must have available to post

matter positions are not liquidated to fund redemptions in the event that positions were liquidated to fund redemptions mlai as the general partner of the partnership has the ability to override

markets as industrial metals got caught in the downdraft of energy and equity prices the trading programs short positions were not as successful in nickel and whippy gold and silver markets continued to test investment approach but overall profits in the sector outweighed losses to lead to a successful january in metals for the partnership losses were posted to the partnership in the middle of the quarter the trading program suffered losses shorting copper in the face of a solid rally in that market and also misplayed gold with an unsuccessful long trade and platinum with an unsuccessful short trade losses were posted to the partnership at the end of the quarter the global metals sector was unprofitable for the trading program particularly gold and silver markets that did not settle into any defined pattern the industrial metals provided little sanctuary as only a short position in nickel yielded a profit for the trading program in march versus losing positions in copper zinc and aluminum the agriculture sector posted losses to the partnership losses were posted to the partnership at the beginning of the first quarter where wheat backtracked sharply against the partnerships long position and caused a loss that outweighed small gains earned for partnership in long corn and short rubber and cotton positions profits were posted to the partnership in the middle of the quarter due to the partnerships short positions in coffee and wheat which aligned nicely with falling prices in those markets profits were posted to the partnership at the end of the quarter leading the way were short positions that captured a sharp drop in sugar prices and a less significant but still profitable drop in coffee prices during march the partnership has no applicable offbalance
