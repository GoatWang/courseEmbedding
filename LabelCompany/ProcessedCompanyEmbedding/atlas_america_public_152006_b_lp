speak only as of the date the statements were made the matters discussed in these forwardlooking statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made projected or implied in the forwardlooking statements we believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable however our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in the future business overview atlas america public  b lp we us or the partnership is a delaware limited partnership and formed on may   with atlas resources llc serving as its managing general partner and operator atlas resources or mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resources partners lp arp arp  we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania tennessee and ohio we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its ultimate parent company atlas energy atlas energy atls  for administrative services the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which primarily produce natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as  well tending routine maintenance and adjustment  reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and  preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of december   our mgp had not withheld any funds for this purpose the mgp is currently evaluating its right to exercise this option based on several factors such as commodity prices the natural decline in well production and current future plugging services and costs markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry natural gas we market the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third party plant operators who process and market our gas the sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index the pricing indices for the appalachian basin are dominion south point tennessee gas pipeline and transco leidy line we do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes as is customary in certain of our other operating areas we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement crude oil crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company the crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region less appropriate trucking charges we do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements for the year ended december   chevron natural gas and us energy exploration corporation accounted for approximately  and  of our total natural gas and oil production revenues respectively with no other single customer accounting for more than  for this period general trends and outlook we expect our business to be affected by the following key trends our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results the areas in which we operate are experiencing a significant increase in natural gas and oil production related to new and increased drilling for deeper natural gas formations and the implementation of new exploration and production techniques including horizontal and multiple fracturing techniques the increase in the supply of natural gas has put a downward pressure on domestic natural gas prices while we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the longterm in the areas in which we operate fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new natural gas and oil reserves our future production cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders including the mgp depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently we face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas and oil prices as initial reservoir pressures are depleted natural gas production from particular wells decreases results of operations gas and oil production the following table sets forth information related to our

were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively natural gas revenues our natural gas revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively an increase of   the  increase in natural gas revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year was attributable to a  increase in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges which were driven by market conditions partially offset by a  decrease in production volumes our production volumes decreased to  mcf per day for the year ended december   from  mcf per day for the year ended december   a decrease of   mcf per day the price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements see item  businesscontractual revenue arrangements thus the price we receive for our natural gas may vary significantly each month as the underlying index changes in response to market conditions the decrease in production volume is mostly due to the normal decline inherent in the life of the wells oil revenues we drill wells primarily to produce natural gas rather than oil but some wells have limited oil production our oil revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in oil revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year was attributable to a  decrease in production volumes partially offset by a

of  bbl per day  costs and expenses production expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively an increase of   this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operating fees and lease road maintenance depletion of our oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively these percentage changes were directly attributable to changes in revenues oil and gas reserve quantities product prices production volumes and changes in the cost basis of oil and gas properties general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   these expenses include thirdparty costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our mgp and vary from period to period due to the costs and services provided to us there was no impairment of oil and gas properties recorded by us for the year ended december   during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment of gas and oil properties of  this impairment related to the carrying amount of these gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at december   the estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by among other factors the deterioration of natural gas prices liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities increased  for the year ended december   to  as compared to  the year ended december   this increase was due to an increase in net earnings before depletion asset impairment and accretion

  cash used in financing activities increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   this increase was due to an increase in cash distributions to partners our mgp may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs the mgp is currently evaluating its right to exercise this option based on several factors such as commodity prices the natural decline in well production and current future plugging services and costs through december   our mgp had not withheld any funds for this purpose any additional funds if required will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our mgp or its affiliates which are not contractually committed to make loans to us the amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed  of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from thirdparties we are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations which we believe is adequate to fund future operation and distributions to our partners historically there has been no need to borrow funds from our mgp to fund operations asset impairment there was no impairment of oil and gas properties recorded by us for the year ended december   during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment of gas and oil properties of  this impairment related to the carrying amount of these gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at december   the estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by among other factors the deterioration of natural gas prices environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety see item  environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last  years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on activities such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants generation and disposal of wastes including wastes that may have naturally occurring radioactivity and use storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health the environment andor endangered species other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the united states it is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change or that our efforts will prevent material costs if any from rising changes in prices and inflation our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services while we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals depletion and amortization asset impairment fair value of derivative instruments and the probability of forecasted transactions we summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements included in item financial statements included in this report the critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified are discussed below depletion and impairment of longlived assets longlived assets the cost of natural gas and oil properties less estimated salvage value is generally depleted on the unitsofproduction method natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable a longlived asset is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are based upon our estimates that rely on various assumptions including natural gas and oil prices production and operating expenses any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset as discussed in general trends and outlook within this section recent increases in natural gas drilling have driven an increase in the supply of natural gas and put a downward pressure on domestic prices further declines in natural gas prices may result in additional impairment charges in future periods there was no impairment of oil and gas properties recorded by us for the year ended december   during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment of gas and oil properties of  this impairment related to the carrying amount of these gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at december   the estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by among other factors the deterioration of natural gas prices events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include among other factors operating losses unused capacity market value declines technological developments resulting in obsolescence changes in demand for products manufactured by others utilizing our services or for our products changes in competition and competitive practices uncertainties associated with the united states and world economies changes in the expected level of environmental capital operating or remediation expenditures and changes in governmental regulations or actions fair value of financial instruments we have established a hierarchy to measure our financial instruments at fair value which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical unrestricted assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level   inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability level   unobservable inputs that reflect the entitys own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity but rather through particular valuation techniques we use a fair value methodology to value the assets and liabilities for our outstanding derivative contracts our commodity hedges are calculated based on observable market data related to the change in price of the underlying commodity and are therefore defined as level  fair value measurements liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include our asset retirement obligations aro that are defined as level reserve estimates our estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves and future net revenues from them are based upon reserve analyses that rely upon various assumptions including those required by the sec as to natural gas and oil prices drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures and availability of funds the accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data the interpretation of that data the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates we engaged wright and company inc an independent thirdparty reserve engineer to prepare a report of our proved reserves see item properties any significant variance in the assumptions utilized in the calculation of our reserve estimates could materially affect the estimated quantity of our reserves as a result our estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise actual future production natural gas and oil prices revenues development expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves may vary substantially from our estimates or estimates contained in the reserve reports and may affect our ability to pay distributions in addition our proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history prevailing natural gas and oil prices mechanical difficulties governmental regulation and other factors many of which are beyond our control our reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact the calculation of impairment and depletion of oil and gas properties generally an increase or decrease in reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will have a corresponding inverse impact to depletion expense asset retirement obligations we recognize and estimate the liability for the plugging and abandonment of our gas and oil wells the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset the estimated liability is based on our historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserve estimates external estimates as to the cost to plug and abandon the wells in the future and federal and state regulatory requirements the liability is discounted using our mgps assumed creditadjusted riskfree interest rate revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimates of plugging and abandonment costs or remaining lives of the wells or if federal or state regulators enact new plugging and abandonment requirements we have no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations except for our gas and oil properties we believe that there are no other material retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets working interest our partnership agreement establishes that revenues and expenses will be allocated to our mgp and limited partners based on their ratio of capital contributions to total contributions working interest our mgp is also provided an additional working interest of  as provided in the partnership agreement due to the time necessary to complete drilling operations and accumulate all drilling costs estimated working interest percentage ownership rates are utilized to allocate revenues and expense until the wells are completely drilled and turned online into production once the wells are completed the final working interest ownership of the partners is determined and any previously allocated revenues based on the estimated working interest percentage ownership are adjusted to conform to the final working interest percentage ownership mar   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage oil

formed on may   with atlas resources llc serving as its managing general partner and operator atlas resources or the mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp arp  on october   the mgps ultimate parent atlas energy lp atlas energy atls  and its midstream subsidiary atlas pipeline partners lp apl entered into definitive agreements to be acquired by targa resources corp and targa resources partners lp respectively immediately prior to the acquisition atlas energy will distribute to its unitholders  of the limited liability company interests in arps general partner which has changed its name to atlas energy group llc new atlas and will become a separate publicly traded company as a result of the distribution new atlas will hold all of atlas energys nonmidstream holdings which includes the partnerships business as well as the general partner interest incentive distribution rights and atlas energys limited partner interest in arp we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania tennessee and ohio we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy for administrative services we intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated andor thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as · well tending routine maintenance and adjustment · reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and · preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of september   our mgp withheld  of net production revenue for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry results of operations the following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues volumes sales prices

our unbilled revenues as of june   our unadjusted natural gas revenues were  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in natural gas revenues for the

production expenses were  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively a decrease of   production expenses were  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively a

borrowings from our mgp or its affiliates which are not contractually committed to make loans to us the amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed  of our total subscriptions
