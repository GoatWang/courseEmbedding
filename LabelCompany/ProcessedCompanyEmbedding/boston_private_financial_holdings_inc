clients regain the equity that they lost when the prices dropped read more pouyan broukhims recent interview withwestern real estate businessdiscussing recent trends in  for commercial real estate what is the biggest challenge you anticipate for commercial real estate finance in  the biggest challenge ahead is uncertainty in credit markets that will bring rate increases to the private money sector which has been growing in a way of increased funding from institutional and hedge fund markets over the last  to  months what are you most optimistic about for  we are very optimistic for  because we expect borrowers who have been sitting on the sidelines with cash to take advantage of lower interest rates and log into longer fixed interest rates on apartment buildings and commercial loans we believe the start of the fed increasing rates will positively affect the real estate market as a whole until affordability is challenged the real estate market will be strong in all aspects what sectors of commercial real estate are you seeing the most activity with apartment buildings always have high activity and that activity will only increase with rental rates increasing we see a lot of investors taking advantage of transactions that require repositioning for the highest and best rate of returns on their investments are there any property types where lending has slowed noticeably we believe retail will experience growing pains as online retailers take a bigger market share from smaller retail stores we are very cautious in lending to bigger retail stores with high overhead what other factors will most affect the lending environment in  — and specifically what effects do you anticipate i think the challenges we will see in  are going to be the byproduct of interest rates we expect the market to get hot before it stumbles about  in  to  property valuescap rates – the apartment market will have much lower caps as investors get more aggressive with the opportunities in repositioning their assets are you seeing changes in underwriting underwriting standards seem to be relaxing as competition from new investors and banks see higher profit margins with the increase in rates legislativegovernmental – there is high probably that the incoming administration will reduce regulation but regulation is not bad in this growing environment and a projection in decrease in values within  to  months with regard to commercial real estate what are the bright spotsgeographically or by property type and what are the weak spots geographically or by property type as bigger cities get bigger we expect apartments and units in major metropolitan cities to grow significantly in the next  to  months as there is a major shift in affordability with minimum wage
