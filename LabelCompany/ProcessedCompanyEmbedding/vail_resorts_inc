worldwide hotels  while some tips apply to the uk too also see the dedicated uk hotels guide plus weve a guide on how to play detective and uncover secret hotels do your research first to pick the right hotel whether you want to spend a few nights in luxury fancy a cosy boutique hotel or just want a basic room as cheap as chips the trick is to pick the right hotel first within your budget then try to get it for the best price possible you might already have a particular hotel in mind but if not its important to do your homework when picking your hotel there are a couple of things to watch out for dont trust the star system amenities determine star ratings not quality  a  rating is often based on a pool big foyer and conference facilities not how nice the place is as theres no universal worldwide standard stars may be given by governments review organisations or even the hotel itself so treat them with a big pinch of salt see a full guide to what stars mean check tripadvisor a worldwide institution tripadvisor lists detailed reviews and customer ratings for hotels by past guests however always remember anyone can pen a review some hoteliers sign up and post glowing reports of their own hotels once youve settled on a hotel  or a shortlist of several  check out the direct price on its website but dont book yet this will give you a good benchmark for the going rate  a useful starting point if you want to haggle later on too its also a good way to find out if the hotels offering any special deals for those who do book direct comparison sites usually give the best price check the top comparison sites to see whos selling it cheapest  the same room can be sold at vastly different prices here are our three top pick sites try hotelscombined or trivago  they tend to be cheapest to broaden your search try travelsupermarket popular review site tripadvisor lets you read reviews and do quick comparisons while its not a comparison site its also worth checking hotelscom for extra discounts free stays and memberonly prices once youve found the best comparison site price call the hotel to see if itll beat it  sometimes they offer direct bookers early booking promos or threefortwo night deals that comparison sites miss its all very well us saying it but to see how it works in reality and how much you could save here are a few successes from those at mse towers i booked five nights for two people in a fivestar hotel in zanzibar all inclusive for £ total via trivago thats less than half the £ price booking direct  mse nick i got seven nights in a fourstar hotel on the coast near rome for £ total including breakfast that saved over £ compared to booking direct and i got  cashback on it too  mse sally beware of hidden taxes and charges some brokers hide the true cost of a stay until the final booking page in some cases the first time youll find out the true figure is at the hotel many countries charge a ££ per day room tax which isnt always clearly indicated even if a website says that taxes at a particular percentage rate apply on top of the price displayed you may not find out the actual cost until later this can mean that some sites unfairly come up cheapest when youre searching even comparison sites sometimes show the price minus taxes so always click through to check the final price before choosing see revealed hidden hotel charges also watch out for rooms on request if a site says it has rooms on request this means it has only asked for rooms from the hotel  there may actually not be a room available be careful not to go for one of these and lose a firm cheap deal elsewhere play detective and uncover secret hotel bargains with a bit of detective work mega bargains are available from sites selling secret hotel rooms here youre just told a star level and rough location  only once youve paid do you find out the hotels name this means rockbottom prices as hotels neednt worry about losing trade from those who go to them directly you can never be  sure which hotel youll be staying at before you book so these sites arent for those desperate to stay at a particular place but there are usually sneaky ways to discover the hotels identities to see if its worth it the top sites which do this include lastminutecom and hotwire for uk and worldwide deals and the bidding site priceline for a full howto and more details see our uncovering secret hotels guide hotel rebook trick   if you book with free cancellation you can save if the price drops whether youve booked via a travel agent or direct with the hotel often youre able to cancel for free up to a certain point typically  hours before your stay starts if you dont have free cancellation you may be able to take advantage of sites price promises  see more on how below if you book or have booked a room you can save by cancelling if the price drops after youve booked simply cancel the original booking then rebook at the cheaper price often this can work with the site you booked with most booking sites and hotel websites give you a nonrefundable and a free cancellation option for each room type nonrefundable rooms tend to be cheaper so youll need to weigh up if paying more for free cancellation is worth it heres some inspiration to show it can work i saved £ when the price dropped two days before travel  alison via twitter even if cancelling your booking isnt free its worth weighing up the cancellation charge against how much the price has dropped  if the charge is small you could still be quids in how to check if theres free cancellation if its not clear check the terms and conditions  they should clarify your cancellation rights  before you book its not likely to be free cancellation if youre asked to pay upfront though it depends what site you book through if you cant see a free cancellation room in the options for the hotel you want call it and check what to watch out for although this can save £s its not foolproof so check your booking for any hidden tcs  make sure that cancelling really is free and there arent any extra charges bear in mind some sites make you pay in full when booking even if you can cancel penaltyfree if so youll need to factor in if you can afford to rebook given the refund from the original booking may take days or even weeks to come through be aware that if you booked in a currency other than sterling the value of your refund could be less  or more  due to currency fluctuations this is just one of the life hacks we feature on the site see our  moneysaving life hacks guide for lots more  including an app which lets you eat neighbours food for free how to turn your phone into a free satnav and a tool to check if hackers have stolen your info hotel rebook trick   some sites have price promises and will refund the difference some sites offer price promises guaranteeing to refund the difference if the price of the hotel youve booked drops before your stay or you find it cheaper elsewhere so even if you didnt book with free cancellation you may still be able to get money back the comparable hotel must be on exactly the same terms as your original booking so the same room hotel and dates plus the same booking type  for example bed and breakfast nonrefundable it also must be available to book in the same currency you originally paid in or booked using and the price must include all taxes and fees secret hotels where you find out the name of the hotel after youve paid are generally excluded its also worth noting that screenshots arent accepted as proof  when you claim under the price guarantee the site youre claiming from must be able to find the deal itself here are some of the big sites which do this expedia has a price guarantee which applies if you find the same booking cheaper no later than  hours before youre due to check in submit your claim by filling out its claim form ebookers will also refund the difference up to  hours before checkin  fill in this claim form if you booked a flight and hotel together it’ll only refund the difference if you find the exact same deal within  hours of booking hotelscom suggests cancelling and rebooking if you can cancel for free as do we  see above but if your booking is nonrefundable itll offer you the difference back in vouchers you can use on a future hotelscom booking youll need to submit a claim via this hotelscom page hotelscombined also offers a price guarantee though its more limited than the three above youve just  hours after booking to make a claim and you cant do it if the cheaper price youve found is via a site that features on hotelscombined see the full tcs spotted a price promise thats not on our list let us know in the forum get

especially when it comes to hotels although rates vary topcashback and quidco  the two biggest cashback sites  pay up to  when booking hotels through particular sites for example at the time of writing booking through hotelscom via topcashback gives you  cashback or get  cashback on expedia via quidco of course were not saying book via a certain site because the cashback is high  always do a comparison and ensure you couldnt get a cheaper price overall elsewhere and remember too cashbacks not guaranteed so think of it as a bonus  see our top cashback sites guide for more info sign up for free to shortterm hotel sales sites special membersonly websites such as conde nast traveller secret escapes and travelzoo offer big but shortlived discounts on luxury hotels worldwide its free to sign up  you just need to log in to see whats available for example we found an executive king room at the mövenpick ibn battuta gate hotel dubai for £night with secret escapes compared with £night when booked directly the chateau monfort in milan was £night through the site and £night booked directly hotel companies and travel brokers also often offer shortterm sales and these can be worth looking at but always do your own independent research to see if youre really getting a good deal or if you can beat it elsewhere register for websites email alerts to bag extra discounts  and make sure you log in one way to secure an added discount is to sign up for different sites email alerts priceline for example sends out  blanket discount codes via email and many others do similar  if you can sign up to a few if you get tired of the emails after youve booked you can always unsubscribe when you dont need to look for a hotel and resubscribe when you do it can also help to have an account with the site youre using as some offer exclusive deals or discounts just for registered users bookingcom expedia hotelscom and venerecom are among those to do this  make sure you log in when searching scout around for special opening rates new hotels often offer special rates to drum up custom typically this can be at least  off or even complimentary stays to find new hotel openings scour industry publications such as hotel news resource and hotel designs  these cover news worldwide its also worth keeping an eye on forum threads and social media for alerts on opening rate discounts you can even try the brazen approach and just call up the hotel to ask about about special rates  a bit of sweet talk goes a long way register with loyalty schemes for mates rates many hotel chains have freetojoin loyalty schemes  some of the big ones include best western rewards hilton hhonors intercontinental hotels group rewards club and marriott rewards these loyalty schemes are worth joining not so much for the free stays  which can take ages to clock up  but for the special offers they  send to members plus if you call the hotel and ask for a discount or an upgrade when you check in youre always more likely to get one as a preferred guest going in a group villas apartments and airbnb can undercut hotels if youre travelling with extended family or a gaggle of friends cottages villas and apartments can massively undercut similar quality hotels  and the bigger the group the bigger the potential saving its usually selfcatering and youll have to do your own cleaning and washing up but if you want space privacy a kitchen washing machine and more it can be a winner and with the rise in popularity of sites such as airbnb its now easier than ever to find rooms or properties for your party abroad for example we found a threebedroom villa in malaga priced at £ for a weeks stay in midaugust compared with a nearby hotel costing £ weve more on this in our cheap holiday rentals guide including how to score discounts booking directly with owners and for inspiration weve stayed at wonderful places in europe and the caribbean using rental sites and have always been delighted its way more costeffective than hotels barbecues on relaxing evenings with glasses of wine jump in the pool anytime do washing as you go loads of privacy and space to enjoy yourselves as a family i love it  mrsdee consider worldwide hostels  dirtcheap not dirty hostels can offer massive savings over hotels while a few may be dodgy many are clean and friendly with free internet access and breakfast plus youre more likely to strike up a conversation in a hostel than a hilton and you wont necessarily be bunking up in a dorm either  many offer singles twins and doubles the centrally located riverside lodge hostel in berlin for example has excellent reviews and double rooms are priced at £night  staying at a nearby hotel would cost around £night another example found by forumite caro is the ymca hostel in hong kong which has doubles for £night and the same spectacular views as the peninsula hotel next door where doubles cost around £night to check prices and availability use hostelbookerscom and hostelworld  both give hostels a percentage rating based on users experiences even if they say a hostels full always try emailing direct in case theres a spare room that doesnt show up to read more reviews from past guests and compare prices try hostelzcom on top of cheap prices there are further discounts to be had with a £year youth hostels association membership £year by direct debit you can get up to £ off per night at hostelling international hostels unders can bag membership for £year £year by direct debit traditional package hols are often cheaper than diy trips package holidays often win if youre heading for a traditional tourist destination eg rhodes malaga for seven  or  days when we looked we found a week on the costa brava in august for a family of four including flights transfers and accommodation at £person going diy the flights alone for the same dates were around £person  add a hotel and it pushes the cost per person to around £ plus with a package you get atol protection see below for what this means for package holiday prices skimpier than rihannas bikini always book late but if you need special facilities book early and consider carefully whether booking a package really will save you money see cheap package holidays for a full guide pay by credit card or book hotels and flights together to protect your booking package holidays are usually protected always check under either the atol or abta consumer protection scheme this means if your tour operator goes bust youre covered if you dont opt for a package holiday though there are still ways to make sure youre covered get atol protection on diy bookings atol doesnt protect standalone hotel bookings but even if youre not booking a package if you book a flight and separate hotel or car hire together or within  hours from the same travel website not airline you also get atol protection even better if you book flights and a hotel together expedia ebookers and lastminutecom sometimes give extra discounts compare this with booking the cheapest flight and hotel separately to see if this protection costs you pay by credit card if a hotel stays more than £ and you pay by credit card youll get extra protection thats because under section  of the consumer credit act for purchases over £ the credit card provider is equally liable if something goes wrong see our section  guide for more info booked directly with a firm that went bust check your insurance policy some insurers will cover you in the event of cancellation and possibly for other elements of your trip too like flights if you cant find anywhere else to stay alternatively if you booked using a credit or debit card see above stay in a swanky spare room spare room and apartment rental sites have mushroomed in recent years and can often offer cheap shortterm stays worldwide the idea is hosts put you up in their spare room or rent out their whole apartment to earn cash on the side you can stay everywhere from swanky la lofts to houseboats in paris and its a great way to meet locals crashing in spare rooms often beats hotel prices too we found a night in a double room in a barcelona flat for £  a similar quality hotel cost £ the sites below act as middlemen between hosts and guests to help its worth trying a few as sometimes prices differ for the same room between sites when comparing always click through to the payment page as they can add extra fees at the final stage best for breadth airbnb its the biggest name in spare room renting over  listings worldwide it charges guests a  fee to stay smaller selection but can be cheaper wimdu another major player it features over  listings worldwide its free for hosts to list so some price at slightly lower rates to reflect this guests pay a  flat fee to stay shown on the payment page for belt n braces flatscom it covers slightly fewer properties but its also worth a look the site features over  listings worldwide it doesnt charge any extra fees for guests but charges hosts  of the transaction before booking find out as much as you can about the host neighbourhood and property scour reviews from visitors and check photos closely when you pay go through the sites own payment system for added protection rather than handing over cash  that way your money will be held for  hours

list of moneysavers top tips on safe hasslefree camping see the great camping hunt in the forum check if the price includes breakfast  and if its really worth it when youre booking a room its always worth checking if the price includes breakfast  sometimes it will sometimes it wont always check theres no hard and fast rule on this sometimes bookingsites or hotels will throw in a free breakfast as an added incentive to book and its worth it but sometimes youll find you end up paying much more for the night as a result so factor in the cost most places are likely to have nearby cafes bakeries and eateries that will allow you to pick up inexpensive breakfast items if you dont pay however if breakfast is included for only a little more it might be worth shelling out the extra amount breakfast also makes an excellent haggling point  if youre trying to persuade a hotel to beat a comparison sites price ask them if itll throw in breakfast for free work for your food and board its sometimes possible to bag free food and accommodation in exchange for a few hours work each day usually on farms two of the biggest programmes are helpx and wwoof worldwide opportunities on organic
