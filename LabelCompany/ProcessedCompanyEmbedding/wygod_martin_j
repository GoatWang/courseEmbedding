be clamoring for computer software stocks with that in mind he put  into computer sciences wygods instincts proved correct by  the investment returned a profit of  million wygod made himself even richer when he invested in the private stock of computax another computer company when the company went public the stock value increased from  to the mid–s were an especially prosperous time for the

profits to start porex technologies in january by then wygod wanted to get into the mail–order prescription drug business he had heard about national pharmacies a small mail–order drug company that provided funded health benefit plans national pharmacies he learned had revenues of about  million and profits of about  wygod also learned that it was part of financier victor posners apl corp wygod paid posner  million in porex stock and cash for it and then set out to find business for his new company he merged porex with national pharmacies to form medco containment services incorporated and in six months he had signed up several corporate–funded drug benefit plans including those offered by alcoa general motors and georgia–pacific wygod based medco in fair lawn new jersey setting it up as a pharmacy–benefit management company focused on the sale of prescription medicines with the help of financiers michael milken and drexel burnham medcos market value shot up to  million eventually it would become a –billion company with a net income of  millionwygod became more firmly entrenched in health care after his  acquisition of paid prescriptions from computer sciences corporation the move gave medco access to a national network of  drugstores that accepted its health care cardby  medco had benefited from the robust growth of funded drug benefit plan coverage in the united states in  only about  percent of the population were covered by the early s  percent were covered medco was mailing maintenance drugs through  funded benefit drug plans of corporations unions hmos and state retirement systems also it boasted of its exceptional service and lower prices according to forbess howard rudnitsky medco specialized in maintenance medication drugs including prescriptions for blood pressure arthritis diabetes gastrointestinal problems and other chronic ailments rudnitsky added medco claimed it was saving customers  percent or more over retail pharmacy prices at the time independent retail pharmacists and state pharmacy boards lobbied to restrict mail order drug services however they were unsuccessfulchronology martin j wygod born graduated from new york university invested in computer sciences corp bought glasrock medical services sold glasrock for –million profit formed medco containment services  sold medco to merck established careinsite incorporated became co–ceo of webmd named chairman of the board of webmdto make itself even more attractive to customers medco created its prescribers choice program which took its service to a higher level beyond the maintenance drugs medco with the addition of the new program was involved in therapeutic drug categories in which drugs were priced at different levels this is how the program worked if a prescription for the more expensive brand of drug in those categories was mailed to medco while an equivalent drug could be prescribed at a lower price then a medco pharmacist notified the prescribing physician obviously some major pharmaceutical companies were uncomfortable with the program but others felt is was better than cost–containment programs run by hmos that offered reimbursement for only one or two drugs prescribed for a conditionin  wygod made a deal with merck and company a major pharmaceutical manufacturer to buy medco for  billion as part of the deal wygod became a member of mercks board of directors and he continued running medco it turned out to be another sweet deal when wygod eventually left merck toward the end of the decade he took with him more than  million in stock and fees from the merger the profit bought him a –acre ranch in rancho santa fe californiaby  nearly  million americans were covered by medco–administered drug benefit plans and medco had become more than just a mail–order company the major retail pharmacy chains and most independent pharmacies were accepting medcos benefit card the card enabled the user to get his or her prescription filled for little or nothing medco reimbursed the retailer and charged the benefit plan at its discount rateswhen wygod left merck he became chairman of synetic an online medical company that subsequently merged with medical manager corp in may  wygod became chairman of the board of medical manager a position he held until september in  wygod together with a group of former medco colleagues helped establish careinsite inc an internet–based health care corporation the aim of the web site was to provide physicians pharmacists and payers with an internet–efficient method of accessing and exchanging medical information as well as claims processing and information retrieval services careinsite automated and put online the rules that govern managed care and dictate treatments and drugs that doctors can provide to their patients essentially it was an online medco he served as chairman of the board of careinsite from  until september  wygod scheduled an ipo for june  with the system set to debut in strategic locations including new york city in september before that happened however merck went to court in february  to stop the sites implementation wygod and his partners merck claimed had signed non–competition agreements with mercks medco pharmacy benefit manager wygod countered that the agreement expired in may  and filed his own suit in july  it was wygods contention that merck was out to eliminate competitiondespite mercks lawsuit and the complexity of wygods business model as well as the deeply troubled health care industry careinsite made it to the market in february  it was acquired by webmd as a result of other acquisitions and mergers webmd became the largest processor of electronic transactions in the health care industry it was also the top consumer health care web portal as well as a leading provider of software services to physician officeswygod who entered webmd via careinsite served as co–chief executive officer of webmd from september  until october  sharing the ceo reins with jeffrey arnold wygod became sole chief executive of the atlanta–based webmd when arnold resigned at the time webmd like many dotcom companies formed in the late s began experiencing significant financial trouble in may  its stocks had reached a high of  a share soon after though the value plummeted wygod took over at a time when webmd required massive restructuring because of substantial overlap created when webmd acquired several companies besides careinsite these companies included envoy medical manager and onhealth network the overhaul resulted in the company laying off more than  employees and eliminating many of its costly strategic alliances the company said the restructuring could help it save about  million by the fourth quarter of the restructuring plan included two phases the first phase involved webmd consolidating its offices and data centers reducing marketing and promotional expenses and eliminating redundant positions the second phase involved consolidating sales forces and focusing on customer service generating revenue and eliminating non–strategic and non–profitable products and contractsin april  wygod was appointed chairman of the board of webmd he remained the companys ceo he was confident the he and webmd would finally be able to pull off what others couldnt a profitable e–health enterprise wygods goals according to businessweek online included constructing tight digital links between insurers doctors and patients analysts said the measures could possibly save webmd at least  billion in processing and other back–office costsone of the ways wygod and webmd hoped to get out of the red was to offer a new piece of technology a hand–held device for doctors the company would charge between  and  per month for a service that doctors can use to perform tasks that would include writing prescriptions conducting lab inquiries and monitoring billingsocial and economic impactwhenever anyone goes to the pharmacy to fill a prescription and they present a card that provides them with a substantial discount they are benefiting in part by martin wygods involvement in the health care industry and cost–containment practices wygod helped revolutionize medical billing when he got into the mail order prescription business in the s as chairman and ceo of medco wygod turned the company into a major player in the mail–order prescription drug industrybesides making a great deal of money with his investment strategies wygod in the process essentially transformed the drug distribution business when he created medco containment services which was an intermediary between health plans and pharmacies medco administered the health plans rules for prescribing medication as a result it saved the payers money by
