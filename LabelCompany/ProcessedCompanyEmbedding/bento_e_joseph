illustrations by donata dal molin casagrande if some of the story is beyond quite small children they would probably enjoy looking at and hearing about the pictures jeanne perego does a good job with the story though as i learned some things about pope emeritus benedict i didnt know beforethe introduction is by father georg ganswein longtime personal secretary of pope emeritus benedict and now secretary to pope francis what a book hell be able to write someday and i mean that in a good way father georg writes in the introductionpope benedict never stops repeating that love is the secret to joy and peace in the world that only love that is god can fulfill the desires of our hearts and give meaning to our lives p a good lesson from the end of the book for children and adults from the

review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsa popes life as told by a catbyjiffyon september  format hardcoververified purchasejoseph and chico is a page childrens picture book dealing with the life of joseph ratzinger who became pope benedict xvi as told by a cat named chico i have a strong bias in favor of realistic illustrations and these definitely are not realistic but the pictures are so charming that i didnt care they show various events in josephs life especially during his youth and chico is always present another reviewer pointed out that this was impossible because of the life span of cats and i wondered about that too but chico mentions on page  that he first met joseph when the priest became a professor at the university of regensburg and lived next door to chicos family so how did chico get into the earlier pictures maybe as he told the story he imagined himself as an observer to things that happened before he was born other reviewers had problems with the reading level which granted is too advanced for the youngest readers but adults can read it to young children in multiple sittings and older children can read it themselves so can adults who may enjoy it more than anyone its a delightful biography of an admirable man combined with a lot of extremely appealing cat pictures i loved it and i think others will tooread morecommentwas this review helpful
