positive corporate culture and employee morale that have made farmer bros greatintends to nominate a slate of highly qualified director candidates for the  annual meeting news provided by save farmer bros aug    et share this article fort worth texas aug   prnewswire  save farmer bros a stockholder group led by carol farmer waite and certain other members of the founding family which collectively owns approximately  of the outstanding shares of farmer bros co nasdaq farm farmer bros or the company announced today that the group has delivered a letter to the board of directors of farmer bros the board highlighting its serious concerns with the companys strategic direction operational performance and governance under the direction of its current ceo and board  current evebitda valuation revenue growth wacc and roic save farmer bros is also extremely disappointed that the board has repeatedly failed to engage in a dialogue regarding the groups serious concerns and is preparing to nominate a slate of highly qualified candidates for election to the board at the  annual meeting save farmer bros has retained olshan frome wolosky llp as its legal and strategic advisor in connection with its investment and involvement at farmer bros the full text of the open letter to the board follows august   via electronic mail board of directors farmer bros co   north freeway suite   fort worth texas   ladies and gentlemen farmer bros co farmer bros or the company is a business that i care deeply about  it is a business that my grandfather roy edgar farmer founded over  years ago in southern california  it is a business that survived two world wars a great recession and a great depression  it is the only business for which my father roy f farmer and my brother roy edward farmer have worked  it is a business that is in my dna  it is a business that i believe has lost its way we are deeply troubled by what we have witnessed at farmer bros since mike keown became ceo of the company in march  we have witnessed mr keown admittedly pack the board of directors of farmer bros the board with what are essentially three personal appointees effectively giving him control of the board  how can the board properly oversee mr keown or hold him accountable when he and his handpicked directors are in control we have witnessed the erosion of employee morale under mr keowns leadership not to mention the  or so employees who lost their livelihood as part of his misguided decision to quickly move farmer bros headquarters to texas we have witnessed mr keown waste tens of millions of stockholder dollars on illadvised strategic initiatives rather than returning capital to stockholders we have witnessed the current board members award excessive compensation to management and themselves all while mr keown lays off hundreds of longterm employees these are all practices that my father and grandfather would never have dreamed of  simply stated mr keown and his board have lost touch with the core values that farmer bros was founded on and that contributed to its success we believe that all stockholders deserve a board that listens to them and that consistent with the boards fiduciary obligations appropriately responds to their concerns we have tried to express our concerns to mr keown and the board in a constructive manner but we have been rebuffed at just about every turn  as the largest stockholder of farmer bros beneficially owning  shares of common stock constituting approximately  of the companys shares outstanding we are no longer willing to stand idly by  it is time to restore the corporate culture spirit and employee morale of farmer bros  as such save farmer bros intends to nominate a slate of candidates for election at the companys  annual meeting of stockholders the  annual meeting to replace mr keown and two of his handpicked board appointees charles marcy and christopher mottern  the upcoming  annual meeting will represent a critical opportunity for all stockholders to bring about a positive and muchneeded change in leadership make no mistake about it the interests of the farmer family members who comprise the save farmer bros group are fully aligned with the interests of all farmer bros stockholders  our goals are to restore profitable growth restore a positive corporate culture link executive pay with performance avoid the loss of key employees and improve accountability to stockholders through implementing best practices in corporate governance  these are improvements that if implemented would benefit all stockholders as described more fully below save farmer bros has a number of significant concerns with management and the current board including   the board and managements refusal to have a dialogue – for the past  months mr keown and the board have been almost entirely unresponsive to our attempts to initiate a constructive dialogue   managements poor track record of value creation – farmer bros is undervalued on a trailing and forward ebitda basis relative to managements selected peer group   managements poor operating performance – recently the companys revenue growth has been stagnant  compounding this issue is that operating margins are low which is likely related to its bloated sga expenses among other factors   managements poor capital allocation decisions – recently mr keown and the board have made several questionable capital allocation decisions that have failed to yield significant gains for stockholders including i the relocation of the companys corporate headquarters to texas ii the attempt at expanding into ecommerce iii the investments in the companys long haul fleet iv the rebranding of the companys long haul fleet v the energy sustainability initiative in torrance vi the purchase of exorbitantly expensive equipment in torrance and houston and vii the effort to expand the companys footprint in spices  if there were any doubt the fact that farmer bros return on invested capital is significantly lower than its cost of capital demonstrates how poor these capital allocation decisions have been   the boards numerous corporate governance shortfalls – we do not believe that the board is representing the longterm interests of its stockholders as the board has failed at some of the most basic corporate governance bestpractices          the board and managements refusal to have a dialogue in august  i wrote a letter to the board describing my concerns regarding the direction of the company as well as its current reputation  i never received a response  therefore in october  i delivered another letter with the hope that the board would address my concerns  unfortunately again my concerns were not addressed  as it was becoming clear that the board did not respect the severity of my concerns i attended the companys  annual meeting of stockholders in fort worth texas the  annual meeting with the hope that my questions and concerns would be addressed  unfortunately even my most fundamental concern what the company is doing to increase stockholder value went unanswered within days of the  annual meeting i requested a full transcript of the meeting  rather than providing me with the transcript mr keown and the board forced me to go through various legal channels in order to receive the transcript which was only delivered more than seven months after my request  the company likely incurred significant legal expenses in its attempt to prevent its largest stockholder from receiving a transcript of the  annual meeting  these expenses represent a complete waste of stockholder capital         managements poor track record of value creation mr keown enjoys boasting about the companys total stockholder return during his tenure as ceo  we do not believe he is to credit for the companys improved stock price performance during his tenure  rather we believe that most of the improvement has been due to the fact that mr keowns tenure started from an artificially depressed baseline as well as the significant boost to the stock price when an earnings restatement revealed that the earnings prior to his arrival were not as bad as previously reported the witnessed increases in farmer bros stock price do not appear to reflect improved operating performance we firmly believe that superior management and board leadership would have taken much more advantage of the companys considerable market opportunities and produced far better operating results and unlocked much more stockholder value than has mr keown we believe a better way to gauge mr keown and the boards performance is to look at valuation  farmer bros is significantly undervalued on both a trailing and forward ebitda basis when compared to managements

dunkin brands group inc national beverage corp spartannash co inventure foods inc and treehouse foods inc boulder brands inc excluded as it is no longer a publicly traded company in our view there is a simple explanation for why farmer bros is undervalued by the investment community mr keown and the boards lackluster operating performance poor capital allocation decisions and numerous corporate governance shortfalls         managements poor operating performance mr keown and the boards track record of poor operating performance is clearly demonstrated by the companys lagging revenue growth ballooning costs and depressed margins sales is the lifeblood of the companys business and yet we are not convinced that growing revenue is a priority for mr keown or the board  just take a look at the following chart and ask yourself if it indicates that revenue growth is a priority photo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnh source capital iq note managements selected peer group defined in farmer bros form k filed on september   as bg foods inc coffee holding co inc dunkin brands group inc national beverage corp spartannash co inventure foods inc and treehouse foods inc boulder brands inc excluded as it is no longer a publicly traded company to add insult to injury not only has the companys revenue growth lagged but its operating margin is lower than most of managements selected peer group  a major symptom of the problem is the companys bloated sga expense which as a percentage of revenue is the largest among managements selected peer group at  over the last twelve months  if you add the companys restructuring costs incurred since announcing that farmer bros was relocating its headquarters to texas then the companys sga as a percentage of revenue increases to  over the last twelve months         managements poor capital allocation decisions recently mr keown and the board have made several questionable capital allocation decisions that have failed to yield positive gains for stockholders including the relocation of the corporate headquarters to texas the attempt at expanding into ecommerce the investments in the companys long haul fleet the rebranding of the companys long haul fleet the energy sustainability initiative in torrance the purchase of exorbitantly expensive equipment in torrance and houston and the effort to expand the companys footprint in spices it is unclear as to what the vision of mr keown and the board is as key capital allocation decisions seem to contradict each other  between  and  the company invested in mechanical upgrades and a rebranding of the fleet operation  initially the rebranding focus appeared to make sense as it was meant to provide visibility and increase name recognition  however mr keown inexplicably sold the fleet in  barely two years after the launch of the new focus to facilitate a different strategic initiative – the transition to third party logistics pl  it is deeply concerning that mr keown and the board would exhibit such poor judgment that resulted in a flipflop on a costly capital allocation decision within only  months  this is just one example of how mr keown and the boards decision making is all over the place  indeed mr keowns history of poor capital allocation decisions leaves us to wonder if even the transition to pl was thoroughly and properly analyzed or will mr keown announce yet another major value destructive and capital intensive strategic pivot in the near term consistent with this theme of poor capital allocation decision making we believe mr keown and the board demonstrated their lack of thoroughness when they choose to execute the relocation of the companys corporate headquarters to texas while simultaneously launching its vendor management inventory initiative pl and selling the assets related to its spice products division  any of these corporate events individually would presumably consume much of managements time and energy  the implementation of all four simultaneously raises significant concerns as to whether each strategy and its respective timing was properly analyzed another example of the companys unclear direction related to the corporate relocation was the decision to install costly production line equipment in torrance california during fy  and fy   again why invest stockholders money only to make significant financial changes not too long thereafter  according to mr keown the torrance facility has over time become outdated and inefficient…  over time  does mr keown base all of his expensive capital allocation decisions on a  month investment horizon  what is his plan for the torrance equipment installed in fy  and fy  now that the company is moving to texas the corporate relocation was undertaken to annually save  million million by among other things the company being able recruit greater talent at a lower cost  in the span of fourteen months the announced expected costs of the corporate relocation ballooned from a range of  million million to a range of  million million  on top of the skyrocketing costs we never imagined that the board and managements compensation would be greatly increased despite texas widely acknowledged lower cost of living  what does mr keown and the board have to say to the approximately  former farmer bros employees in torrance who lost their livelihood due to the corporate relocation  is it that cost cutting only applies to nonexecutives  what could possibly be the justification for such an increase in compensation  how does this add to the  million million in annual savings that mr keown promised the corporate relocation would create  it seems that despite their acknowledgement of the importance of costcontrol mr keown and the board are unwilling to sacrifice their bloated salaries and undeserved bonuses mr keowns poor capital allocation decisions are clearly demonstrated when comparing the companys return on invested capital to its cost of capital photo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnh source bloomberg if mr keowns investments are unable to attain returns in excess of the companys cost of capital then it is time to return capital to stockholders         the boards numerous corporate governance shortfalls according to the farmer bros corporate governance guidelines directors should possess the highest personal and professional ethics integrity and values and should be committed to representing the longterm interests of the companys shareholders  we do not believe the board is actually representing the longterm interests of stockholders  after nearly half of a decade under mr keown the board has failed to implement some of the most basic corporate governance bestpractices  these failures include having limited stockholder representation on the board having poor executive compensation practices and having dramatically increasing director compensation we believe there is a troubling misalignment of interests between the board and stockholders  outside of jeanne farmer grossman the independent directors own a mere  stake in the company  accordingly there is a lack of significant stockholder representation on the board  we believe that stockholders as the true owners of the company need to have a strong voice at the board level  such a voice promotes greater accountability and creates an environment that forces other directors to consider new and innovative ways to positively impact stockholder value it seems apparent to us that with so little skin in the game the board does not have the same commitment to stockholder value as we do  we believe a culture focused on longterm value creation and stockholder accountability requires placing stockholder representatives on the board who have a significant financial commitment to the company along with relevant experience  this requirement ensures the proper alignment of interests between the board and stockholders when it comes to executive compensation the board is not successfully aligning the executive compensation program to stockholder demands  this is reflected in the boards response to the companys declining sayonpay results  in   of stockholders supported the companys executive compensation  in    and  the sayonpay votes were    and  respectively  sayonpay results have dropped to a level that should concern the board yet nothing has been done to remedy those poor results which is apparent by the continued low approval of stockholders ironically as the companys sayonpay support has dwindled since  the annual number of compensation committee meetings has nearly doubled  is the compensation committee actually trying to bring compensation more in line with what stockholders are demanding  the following facts should cause all stockholders to question whether mr keown and the board truly have stockholders best interests in mind or rather are they looking out for their own interests by lining their pockets at stockholders expense fact  the base salary for each named executive officer position increased in fy  this increase in salary was approved despite the companys relocation to a lower cost of living area and newer executives having less tenure at farmer bros  again we note that each named executive officer received a raise while approximately  torrancebased employees lost their livelihood fact  the board has limited its transparency when it comes to executive bonus triggers  starting in fy  the trigger has not been disclosed by the compensation committee do any farmer bros employees other than the affected named executive officers even know what the triggers are fact  the largest stockholder on the board was replaced as compensation committee chair after serving in the role for only two years we believe the removal of jeanne farmer grossman the boards largest stockholder as chair of the compensation committee reflects an attempt to stifle any differing views on the board which is contrary to proper corporate governance  this view is supported by the fact that her replacement as chair was one of mike keowns own effective appointees randy clark  also we do not believe it is simply a coincidence that following ms farmer grossmans removal as chair the compensation committee began keeping the bonus triggers confidential fact  management received a significant bonus which was specifically created for fy  despite failing to meet performance targets and worse performance as compared to fy  a special bonus was created under the shroud of all the hard work that was done by management for the relocation efforts  note that prior to mr keown becoming ceo and prior to his effective appointment of directors the board did not see it fit to award management a special bonus in fy  another year management did not meet performance targets fact  in fy  the board awarded mr keown  more stock options than it was authorized to award in response to its limits to authorizing stock options the board merely created a new option for mr keown totaling  shares fact  many board fees increased or were created in fy  a fee for the chairman of the board was created in fy  as was a fee for the nominating and governance committee chair charles marcy fact  every nonexecutive directors total compensation increased in fy  director compensation increased despite the companys poor financial performance in fy  time for a change the sad truth is painfully obvious  farmer bros its officers and employees as well as all stakeholders need fresh leadership to realize the full potential of our stock price  what we do not need any longer is a ceo and board members who are unresponsive to the needs and concerns of the stockholders unresponsive to the opportunities for growth and incapable of creating stockholder value on the basis of operating performance we have never been more concerned about our company  to be completely frank what we are seeing and hearing from mr keown and the board disturbs us deeply  farmer bros has been in existence for over one hundred years because of proper management and cost efficient leadership  sorry to say it does not appear that these principles are valued by mr keown  stockholders deserve better  while our fellow stockholders may not have the same deep familial and emotional connection that we have to farmer bros we are all aligned in the sense that we want to see the company succeed and our respective investment grow in value we are committed to making sure that the board is doing everything in its power to make the right decisions that will continue to propel this company on a path to prosperity for decades to come  to that end and despite that our efforts to improve farmer bros may have created frictions within the farmer family it is our firm belief that a refreshment of the board is necessary to ensure that decades of prosperity indeed happens  as such we are dedicated to affecting this board change and are preparing to nominate a slate of highly qualified candidates for election to the board at the  annual meeting  we look forward to helping restore the stockholderfriendly principles and employeefriendly culture that once defined this company that we continue to care so deeply about very truly yours carol farmer waite save farmer bros    source wwwlinkedincominmikekeown dramatically
