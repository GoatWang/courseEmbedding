company had no record label division at the time and one of its contracted actors tab hunter scored a hit song for dot records which was a division of rival paramount pictures in order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies and to also capitalize on the music business warner bros records was created in  warner purchased reprise records which had been founded by frank sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings with the reprise acquisition warner gained the services of mo ostin who would be mainly responsible for the success of warnerreprise the canadian unit was opened in  as warner reprise canada ltd now called warner music canada co after warner bros was sold to seven arts productions in  forming warner brosseven arts it purchased atlantic records founded in  and wmgs oldest label until wmg completed its acquisition of parlophone in  as well as its subsidiary atco records this acquisition brought neil young into the company fold initially as a member of buffalo springfield young would become one of warners longestestablished artists recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the warnerowned atlantic atco and reprise labels as well as making five albums for geffen records during that labels period of warner distribution the geffen catalogue now owned by universal music group represents youngs only major recordings not under wmg ownership in  two years after being purchased by seven arts the warner brosseven arts company was sold to the kinney national company kinney later changing its name to warner communications combined the operations of all of its record labels and kinney ceo steve ross led the group through its most successful period until his death in  an earlier attempt by warner bros records to create an inhouse distribution arm in  didnt materialize so in  elektra records boss jac holzman approached atlantics jerry wexler with the idea of setting up a joint distribution network for warner elektra and atlantic an experimental branch was established in southern california as a possible prototype for an expanded operation atlantic its subsidiary atco records and its affiliate stax records paved the way for warners rise to industry prominence the purchase brought in atlantics lucrative backcatalogue which included classic recordings by ray charles the drifters the coasters and many more in the mid s atlanticstax had released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including booker t  the mgs sam  dave wilson pickett otis redding ben e king and aretha franklin but the sale led to stax leaving the atlantic fold because the new warner owners insisted on keeping the rights to stax recordings however atlantic also moved decisively into rock and pop in the late s and s signing major british and american acts including led zeppelin cream crosby stills  nash yes emerson lake  palmer average white band dr john king crimson bette midler roxy music and foreigner atlantic exerts autonomyedit it was soon apparent in  that atlanticatco president ahmet ertegün viewed warnerreprise president mike maitland as a rival maitland believed that as vicepresident in charge of the warner brosseven arts music division he should have final say over all recording operations and he further angered ertegün by proposing that most of atlantics backoffice functions such as marketing and distribution be combined with the existing departments at warnerreprise in retrospect ertegün clearly feared that maitland would ultimately have more power than him and so he moved rapidly to secure his own position and remove maitland maitland had put off renegotiating the contracts of joe smith and mo ostin the presidents of the warner bros and reprise labels and this provided ertegün with an effective means of undermining maitland when wexler—now a major shareholder—found out about the contract issue he and ertegün began pressuring eliot hyman to get smith and ostin under contract ostensibly because they were worried that the two executives might move to rival labels—and in fact ostin had received overtures from both the mgm and abc labels in  the wisdom of hymans investments was proved when kinney national company purchased warner brosseven arts for  million more than eight times what hyman had paid for warnerreprise and atlantic combined from the base of his familys funeral parlour business kinney president steve ross had rapidly built the kinney company into a profitable conglomerate with interests that included comic publishing the ashleyfamous talent agency parking lots and cleaning services following the takeover warners music group briefly adopted the umbrella name kinney music because us antitrust laws at the time prevented the three labels from trading as one ross was primarily focused on rebuilding the companys ailing movie division and was happy to defer to the advice of the managers of the companys record labels since he knew that they were generating most of the groups profits erteguns campaign against maitland began in earnest that summer atlantic had agreed to help warner bros in its efforts to establish its labels overseas beginning with its soontobeestablished warner bros subsidiary in australia but when warner executive phil rose arrived in australia he discovered that just one week earlier atlantic had signed a new fouryear distribution deal with a rival local label festival records owned by rupert murdochs news limited mike maitland complained bitterly to kinney executive ted ashley but to no avail – by this time ertegun was poised to make his move against maitland as he had with hyman ertegun urged steve ross to extend mo ostin and joe smiths contracts a recommendation ross was happy to accept ostin however had received overtures from other companies including mgm records and abc records and when he met with ertegun in january  and was offered maitlands job he was unwilling to resign immediately in response ertegun broadly hinted that maitlands days were numbered and that he ertegun was about to take over the recording division unlike the warnerreprise executives atlantics execs the ertegun brothers ahmet and neshui and wexler owned stock in kinney ostin was understandably concerned that if he accepted the position the warner bros staff would feel that he had stabbed maitland in the back but his attorney convinced him that maitlands departure was inevitable regardless of whether or not he accepted the post succinctly advising him dont be a schmuck on sunday january  ted ashley went to maitlands house to tell him he had been dismissed and maitland declined the offer of a job at the movie studio one week later mo ostin was named as the new president of warner bros records with joe smith as his executive vicepresident ertegun nominally remained the head of atlantic but since both ostin and smith owed their new positions to him ertegun was now the de facto head of the warner music division ertegun was given the formal title of executive vicepresidentmusic group maitland moved to mca records later that year and successfully consolidated mcas labels which he couldnt do at warner sedit during the s the kinney group built up a commanding position in the music industry in  kinney bought elektra records and its sister label nonesuch records founded by jac holzman in  for  million bringing in leading rock acts including the doors tim buckley and love and its historically significant folk archive along with the successful budget western classicalmusic label nonesuch records the purchase of elektranonesuch brought a rich back catalogue of folk music as well as the renowned nonesuch catalogue of classical and world music elektra founder jac holzman ran the label under warners for two years but by that time he was by his own admission burnt out after twenty years in the business kinney president steve ross subsequently appointed holzman as part of a sevenperson brains trust tasked with investigating opportunities presented by new technologies a role holzman was eager to accept the same year the group established its first overseas offices in canada and australia by that time the seven arts moniker was dropped from the warner bros name warner bros also founded the casablanca records subsidiary headed by neil bogart but several years later casablanca would become independent of warner bros worldwide distributionedit with the elektra acquisition the next step was forming an inhouse distribution arm for the coowned labels by this time warnerreprises frustrations with its current distributors had reached breaking point joe smith then executive vicepresident of warner bros recalled that the grateful dead were becoming a major act but the distributor was constantly out of stock of their albums these circumstances facilitated the full establishment of the groups inhouse distribution arm initially called kinney record group international by late  us antitrust laws had changed and the company was renamed warnerelektraatlantic wea for short which was renamed warner music in  the word group was added after the formation of aol time warner wea was an early champion of the heavy metal rock music several such bands including the three major pioneers led zeppelin black sabbath and deep purple were all signed to weas labels at least in the united states among the earliest american metal acts to be signed to wea were alice cooper montrose and van halen up to this point the kinneyowned record companies had relied on licensing deals with overseas record labels to manufacture distribute and promote its products in other countries concurrent with the establishment of its new distribution arm the company now began establishing subsidiaries in the other major markets beginning with the creation of warner bros records australia in  soon followed by branch offices in the uk europe and japan in july  the new inhouse distribution company was incorporated as warnerelektraatlantic distributing corp wea and branch offices were established in eight major us cities joel friedman a onetime billboard writer who had been the head of warners advertisingmerchandising division in its early years was appointed to head weas us domestic division and ahmet erteguns brother nesuhi was appointed to oversee its international operations neshui ertegun originally a turkish native like his brother displayed a global perspective and independence from its us counterpart by successfully promoting international acts in their target markets worldwide ertegun headed wea international until his retirement in  a de facto committee of three senior marketing executives—dave glew from atlantic ed rosenblatt from warner bros and mel posner from elektra—oversaw the integration of each labels marketing and distribution through the new division but each label continued to operate totally independently in ar matters and also applied their own expertise in marketing and advertising on july   following the pattern set by similar joint ventures in canada and australia the warner labels entered into a partnership with the british arm of cbs records to press and distribute warnerreprise product in the united kingdom although this was undertaken as a cooperative venture rather than a formally incorporated business partnership the billboard article that reported the new arrangement also noted that despite their intense competition in the us market cbs continued to press warnerreprise recordings in the usa however the new uk arrangement was a major blow to warners previous british manufacturer pye records for whom warnerreprise had been their largest account with the scheduled addition of the uk rights to the atlantic catalogue which would revert to kinney in early  billboard predicted that the warnercbs partnership would have a – share of the uk music market in april  thanks mainly to the influence of ahmet ertegun the kinney group announced a major coup with its acquisition of the worldwide rights to the rolling stones new label rolling stones records following the expiration of the bands contract with british decca then separate from the american label and the acrimonious end to their business relationship with their former manager allen klein under the terms of the deal atlantic subsidiary atco would distribute the stones recordings in the usa with other territories mainly handled by warner bros international divisions one of kinneys wisest investments was fleetwood mac the band signed to reprise in the early s after relocating to the usa and the label supported them through numerous lineup changes and several lean years during which the bands records sold relatively poorly although they remained a popular concert attraction ironically after their transfer to warner bros in  and the recruitment of new members lindsay buckingham and stevie nicks the group scored a major international hit with the single rhiannon and consolidated with the best selling albums fleetwood mac rumours and tusk warner communicationsedit due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations kinney national spun off its nonentertainment assets in  as national kinney corporation and changed its name to warner communications inc in  the warner group acquired another rich prize david geffens asylum records the  million purchase brought in several acts who would prove crucial the warner groups subsequent success including linda ronstadt the eagles jackson browne joni mitchell and later warren zevon on the downside however it was rumored that warners was soon concerned about their possible liability under the california state labor code because of geffens questionable status as both the manager of most of the asylum acts and the head of the record label to which they were signed the sale included the asylum records label and its recordings as well as geffens lucrative music publishing assets and the interests in the royalties of some of the artists managed by geffen and partner elliot roberts geffen accepted a fiveyear contract with wci and turned over his  share in the geffenroberts management company to roberts and warners paid geffen and roberts  common shares worth  at the time of the sale plus  in cash and a further  million in promissory notes convertible to common stock although it seemed a lucrative deal at the time geffen soon had reason to regret it uncharacteristically he had greatly underestimated the value of his assets—within asylums first year as a warner subsidiary albums by linda ronstadt and the eagles alone had earned more than the entire value of the asylum sale geffens discomfort was compounded by the fact that within six months of the sale the value of his volatile warner shares had plummeted from  million to just  he appealed to steve ross to intervene and as part of a makegood deal ross agreed to pay him the difference in the share value over five years acting on jac holzmans suggestion that kinney should take asylum from atlantic and merge it with elektra ross then appointed geffen to run the new combined label in  warner gained a brief early lead in digital media when it purchased the atari computer company and in  it bought the franklin mint company wci also blazed the trail in visual music with mtv which it created and coowned in partnership with american express in – warner rapidly divested many of these recent acquisitions including atari franklin mint panavision mtv networks and a cosmetics business in  warnerelektraatlantic formed pacific records for their composers and distributed appropriately by atlantic records alan oday was the first artist signed to the label and the first release was undercover angel the song which he described as a nocturnal novelette was in february  within a few months it had become  in the country and has sold approximately two million copies it was also a hit in australia reaching  on the australian singles chart undercover angel also landed oday in an exclusive club as one of only a handful of writersperformers to pen a  hit for themselves and a  for another artist new signings in the late s placed wea in a strong position for the s a deal with seymour steins sire records label which warner bros records later took over brought in several major punk rock and new wave acts including the pretenders the ramones and talking heads and most importantly rising star madonna elektra signed the cars and warner bros signed prince giving wea several of the biggestselling acts of the decade weas labels also distributed a number of otherwise independent labels for example warner bros distributed straight records discreet records bizarre records bearsville records and geffen records the latter was sold to mca in  atlantic records distributed swan song records in  wea scored a major coup by signing a distribution agreement with island records which only covered the united states and select other countries for the next  years initially with warner bros until  then with atlantic afterward wea would distribute such artists as bob marley u robert palmer anthrax and tom waits this relationship ended when island was sold to polygram in  sedit a proposed  international merger between polygram and wea was forbidden by both the us federal trade commission and west germanys cartel office so polygrams halfowner philips then purchased a further  of the company from its partner siemens and bought the remaining shares in  the same year polygram divested its film and publishing operations closed polygram pictures and sold chappell music to warner for us million wea signed with mca records a distribution agreement of this discographic house outside us in  which lasted until  wea formed wea manufacturing in  in  wea took over the german classical label teldec and the british magnet label in  it was announced that warner communications was to merge with time inc to form time warner a transaction that was completed in  following the merger wea continued acquiring independent labels buying cgd records italy and mmg records japan in  sedit through the s time warner was the largest media company in the world with assets in excess of us billion and annual revenues in the billions of dollars by  warners music labels were generating sales valued at more than us billion with operating profits of  million and by  its music division dominated the us music industry with a  share of the domestic market acquisitions and corporate changes within the warner group of labels continued after the time warner merger—in  wea purchased french label carrere records wea was renamed warner music group in  leading french classical label erato  and in  wea bought the spanish dro records hungarys magneoton label the swedish telegram records brazils continental records and finnish label fazer musiiki also miguel tomas lucio was signed to the label atlantic launched two new subsidiary labels in the early s east west records and interscope records in  east west absorbed atco records and was eventually folded into elektra records in  interscope was purchased by mca music entertainment during  the warner music group faced one of the most serious publicrelations crises in its history when a major controversy erupted over the provocative warner bros recording cop killer from the selftitled album by body count a heavy metalrap fusion band led by icet unfortunately for warner the song which mentioned the rodney king case was issued just before the controversial acquittal of the police charged with kings beating which sparked the  los angeles riots and the confluence of events put the song under the national spotlight complaints escalated over the summer—conservative police associations called for a boycott of time warner products politicians including president george h w bush denounced the label for releasing the song warner executives received death threats time warner stockholders threatened to pull out of the company and the new zealand police commissioner unsuccessfully tried to have the record banned there although icet later voluntarily reissued body count without cop killer the furor seriously rattled warner music and in january  the label made an undisclosed deal releasing icet from his contract and returning the body count master tapes to him also in  the rhino records label signed a distribution agreement with atlantic records and time warner bought a  stake in the rhino records label the distribution agreement allowed rhino to begin reissuing recordings from atlantics back catalogue in  canadian beverage giant seagram bought a  stake in time warner and the warner publishing division—now called warnerchappell music – acquired cppbelwin becoming the worlds largest owner of song copyrights and the worlds largest publisher of printed music in  time warner made another dramatic expansion of its media holdings taking over the turner broadcasting system which by then included the turner cable tv network cnn and the screen production houses castle rock entertainment and new line cinema acquisitions that would bring huge profits into the warner group thanks to content assets like seinfeld and the highly successful the lord of the rings film trilogy by the early s senior warner staff like ostin and waronker had remained in their positions for several decades—a highly unusual situation in the american music industry—but the death of steve ross destabilized the time warner hierarchy and over the next few years the music group was increasingly disrupted by internal power struggles leading to a string of major executive upheavals in – which the new york times described as a virtual civil war the central conflict was between mo ostin and warner music group chairman robert morgado who had joined the warner group in the late s because of his political background he had been the chiefofstaff to former new york governor hugh l carey and his lack of music industry experience—especially compared to the widely revered ostin—morgado was viewed as an outsider at warner nevertheless he gained favour with ross and levin and was promoted in  to oversee the warner international music division after helping the company slash costs in its computer game sector since his appointment as head of wbr ostin had always reported directly to steve ross and rosss successor gerald levin but in late  when ostins contract came up for renewal morgado asserted his authority insisting that ostin should now report directly to him the tensions between them reached boiling point in july  when morgado appointed former atlantic chief doug morris to head the warner music group in the usa a decision that many saw as a deliberate move to hasten the departure of ostin and elektra head robert krasnow morgados new structure was announced in august  and bob krasnow resigned from elektra the next day within days after more than  years with the warner music group and more than  years as president and chairman of warner bros records ostin announced he would not renew his current contract and would leave warners when it expired on december   there was more negative publicity the following month when leading elektra act metallica launched a lawsuit against the label seeking a release from their contract and ownership of their master tapes and claiming that morgado had refused to honour a deal they had worked out with krasnow before he quit ostins departure marked a seismic shift in the corporate culture at wbr and the news was greeted with dismay by industry insiders and the many artists whose careers he had helped to nurture lenny waronker had agreed to take over as wbr chairman and ceo but in october  he announced that he would not be taking up the position he initially said that he would remain as president of wbr but by this time there was already widespread speculation that he would leave and he did so soon afterwards the following year he rejoined ostin and son michael as joint head of the newly launched dreamworks label beginning in august  morgado alienated morris by his clumsy handling of warners relationship with interscope records the successful label founded by ted field and jimmy iovine and partowned by warner morgado had resisted making a decision about increasing the warner stake in interscope which encouraged other companies to make overtures to the label in response morgado threatened to send ceaseanddesist notices to executives at several record companies demanding that they stop approaching interscope with buyout offers a move that reportedly infuriated iovine by late  morris was gaining the upper hand over his rival and media reports claimed that morris had moved to settle with metallica offering a deal that was reportedly even more generous than the one they had worked out with krasnow morgado now faced a showdown with morris who felt he was not being allowed to run wmg as he saw fit in october  morris and  other warner executives staged an unprecedented insurrection that nearly paralyzed the worlds largest record company this led to a climactic meeting between morris and gerald levin in late october at which morris reportedly threatened to quit if he had to continue to report to morgado morgado gave in to the demand that morris be granted autonomy to run the north american operations and he was forced to upgrade morriss position from chief operating officer to chief executive of warner music group usa morris promptly named danny goldberg former president of atlantic records to run wbr in defiance of morgado who had a different candidate in mind and levin also reduced morgados power to oversee warners mailorder record club division and its international operations morris then brought in sylvia rhone and seymour stein to stabilize elektra settled the metallica lawsuit and persuaded levin to purchase an additional  of interscope although this initiative proved shortlived the power struggle between morgado and morris reached a dramatic climax in may  when morgado was asked to resign by gerald levin following a welter of complaints from executives at the three major warner music labels who said that morgado was undermining morriss authority and damaging warners reputation among performers morgado was immediately replaced by hbo chairman michael j fuchs but the corporate upheavals did not end there in late june  fuchs abruptly dismissed doug morris saying that morris had been leading a campaign to destabilize warner music in an effort to seize control of the company as morriss strongest ally danny goldberg was also under threat he was initially told that he could stay on as president of wbr as long as he refrained from office politics and concentrate on the daytoday management of the label but he resigned as president of warner bros records soon after to pursue other interests and was replaced by wbr vicechairman russ thyret despite early success with dr dre and snoop dogg and morriss decision to increase warners stake to  by the mids interscope records was being seen as a liability for the warner group time warners board and investors had already been bruised by the damaging  cop killer controversy and now they were faced with renewed criticism about the gangsta rap genre in which interscopes associate imprint death row records was a key label in mid time warner refused to distribute the interscope album dogg food by tha dogg pound forcing the label to seek outside distribution and late in the year tw sold its stake in death row back to coowners jimmy iovine and ted field and soon after it sold off its share in interscope to mca music entertainment the upheaval at warner was beneficial to its rivals who picked up valuable executives who had left warner goldberg moved over to mercury records morris joined mca music entertainment group and led its reorganization into universal music group now the worlds largest record company in november  fuchs was himself sacked by levin leaving the company with a reported us million golden parachute and time warner cochairmen robert a daly and terry semel took over the running of the music division in  seagram boss edgar bronfman jr held talks aimed at merging seagrams universal music headed by morris with the venerable british recording company emi but the discussions came to nothing bronfman then oversaw universals takeover by vivendi wea meanwhile continued to expand its publishing empire buying a  stake in the italian recording and music publishing group nuova fonit cetra also in  time warner bought the remaining  of the rhino records label they did not own the rhino records retail store in los angeles was not included rhino then began reissuing the back catalogues of the warnerreprise and elektraasylum labels in  rhino launched rhino handmade which released limitededition reissues of lesserknown but stillsignificant recordings from the wea labels sedit in  time warner merged with leading american internet service provider aol to create aol time warner the new conglomerate again tried and failed to acquire emi and subsequent discussions about the takeover of bmg stalled with bertelsmann eventually offloading bmg into a joint venture with sony in  aoltw further consolidated its hold over the publishing industry buying  of music publisher deston songs from edel ag by the early s however the effects of the dotcom crash had eroded aols profits and stock value and in  the time warner board sidelined its underperforming partner by dropping aol from its business name looking to reduce its debt load time warner—the corporate successor to warner communications—sold warner music group in  to a group of investors led by edgar bronfman jr for us billion this spinoff was completed on february   in the  transition to independent ownership wmg hired record industry heavyweight lyor cohen from universal music group the result of the merger between the polygram and mca label families to attempt to reduce cost and increase performance contrary to common belief time warner no longer retains any ownership in wmg though it had the option to reacquire up to  of wmg for three years following the closing of the transaction wmgs current logo is the former warner communications logo originally designed by saul bass and is used under license by its former parent which retains full ownership and control of the warner trademarks once free of time warner wmg began cutting costs by offloading lossmaking or lowearning divisions like its rival emi warner reacted to the growth of the digital music market by making a historic change moving out of record production by closing or selling off discpressing plants particularly in territories such as the usa and the netherlands where production costs are high the us manufacturing operations were sold to cinram in  before the purchase from

offer from emi then wmg offered to buy emi and it also rejected the offer in august  emi was purchased by terra firma capital partners talk of a possible wmg acquisition of emi was fanned once again in  after wmg executed a bond offering for  billion which brought to light wmgs relatively strong financial position which was contrasted with the weakened and debtladen state of emi the same year wmg acquired rykodisc and roadrunner records on december   warner announced that it would sell digital music without digital rights management through amazonmp making it the third major label to do so in

records which was a division of rival paramount pictures in order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies and to also capitalize on the music business warner bros records was created in  warner purchased reprise records which had been founded by frank sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings with the reprise acquisition warner gained the services of mo ostin who would be mainly responsible for the success of warnerreprise the canadian unit was opened in  as warner reprise canada ltd now called warner music canada co after warner bros was sold to seven arts productions in  forming warner brosseven arts it purchased atlantic records founded in  and wmgs oldest label until wmg completed its acquisition of parlophone in  as well as its subsidiary atco records this acquisition brought neil young into the company fold initially as a member of buffalo springfield young would become one of warners longestestablished artists recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the warnerowned atlantic atco and reprise labels as well as making five albums for geffen records during that labels period of warner distribution the geffen catalogue now owned by universal music group represents youngs only major recordings not under wmg ownership in  two years after being purchased by seven arts the warner brosseven arts company was sold to the kinney national company kinney later changing its name to warner communications combined the operations of all of its record labels and kinney ceo steve ross led the group through its most successful period until his death in  an earlier attempt by warner bros records to create an inhouse distribution arm in  didnt materialize so in  elektra records boss jac holzman approached atlantics jerry wexler with the idea of setting up a joint distribution network for warner elektra and atlantic an experimental branch was established in southern california as a possible prototype for an expanded operation atlantic its subsidiary atco records and its affiliate stax records paved the way for warners rise to industry prominence the purchase brought in atlantics lucrative backcatalogue which included classic recordings by ray charles the drifters the coasters and many more in the mid s atlanticstax had released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including booker t  the mgs sam  dave wilson pickett otis redding ben e king and aretha franklin but the sale led to stax leaving the atlantic fold because the new warner owners insisted on keeping the rights to stax recordings however atlantic also moved decisively into rock and pop in the late s and s signing major british and american acts including led zeppelin cream crosby stills  nash yes emerson lake  palmer average white band dr john king crimson bette midler roxy music and foreigner atlantic exerts autonomyedit it was soon apparent in  that atlanticatco president ahmet ertegün viewed warnerreprise president mike maitland as a rival maitland believed that as vicepresident in charge of the warner brosseven arts music division he should have final say over all recording operations and he further angered ertegün by proposing that most of atlantics backoffice functions such as marketing and distribution be combined with the existing departments at warnerreprise in retrospect ertegün clearly feared that maitland would ultimately have more power than him and so he moved rapidly to secure his own position and remove maitland maitland had put off renegotiating the contracts of joe smith and mo ostin the presidents of the warner bros and reprise labels and this provided ertegün with an effective means of undermining maitland when wexler—now a major shareholder—found out about the contract issue he and ertegün began pressuring eliot hyman to get smith and ostin under contract ostensibly because they were worried that the two executives might move to rival labels—and in fact ostin had received overtures from both the mgm and abc labels in  the wisdom of hymans investments was proved when kinney national company purchased warner brosseven arts for  million more than eight times what hyman had paid for warnerreprise and atlantic combined from the base of his familys funeral parlour business kinney president steve ross had rapidly built the kinney company into a profitable conglomerate with interests that included comic publishing the ashleyfamous talent agency parking lots and cleaning services following the takeover warners music group briefly adopted the umbrella name kinney music because us antitrust laws at the time prevented the three labels from trading as one ross was primarily focused on rebuilding the companys ailing movie division and was happy to defer to the advice of the managers of the companys record labels since he knew that they were generating most of the groups profits erteguns campaign against maitland began in earnest that summer atlantic had agreed to help warner bros in its efforts to establish its labels overseas beginning with its soontobeestablished warner bros subsidiary in australia but when warner executive phil rose arrived in australia he discovered that just one week earlier atlantic had signed a new fouryear distribution deal with a rival local label festival records owned by rupert murdochs news limited mike maitland complained bitterly to kinney executive ted ashley but to no avail – by this time ertegun was poised to make his move against maitland as he had with hyman ertegun urged steve ross to extend mo ostin and joe smiths contracts a recommendation ross was happy to accept ostin however had received overtures from other companies including mgm records and abc records and when he met with ertegun in january  and was offered maitlands job he was unwilling to resign immediately in response ertegun broadly hinted that maitlands days were numbered and that he ertegun was about to take over the recording division unlike the warnerreprise executives atlantics execs the ertegun brothers ahmet and neshui and wexler owned stock in kinney ostin was understandably concerned that if he accepted the position the warner bros staff would feel that he had stabbed maitland in the back but his attorney convinced him that maitlands departure was inevitable regardless of whether or not he accepted the post succinctly advising him dont be a schmuck on sunday january  ted ashley went to maitlands house to tell him he had been dismissed and maitland declined the offer of a job at the movie studio one week later mo ostin was named as the new president of warner bros records with joe smith as his executive vicepresident ertegun nominally remained the head of atlantic but since both ostin and smith owed their new positions to him ertegun was now the de facto head of the warner music division ertegun was given the formal title of executive vicepresidentmusic group maitland moved to mca records later that year and successfully consolidated mcas labels which he couldnt do at warner sedit during the s the kinney group built up a commanding position in the music industry in  kinney bought elektra records and its sister label nonesuch records founded by jac holzman in  for  million bringing in leading rock acts including the doors tim buckley and love and its historically significant folk archive along with the successful budget western classicalmusic label nonesuch records the purchase of elektranonesuch brought a rich back catalogue of folk music as well as the renowned nonesuch catalogue of classical and world music elektra founder jac holzman ran the label under warners for two years but by that time he was by his own admission burnt out after twenty years in the business kinney president steve ross subsequently appointed holzman as part of a sevenperson brains trust tasked with investigating opportunities presented by new technologies a role holzman was eager to accept the same year the group established its first overseas offices in canada and australia by that time the seven arts moniker was dropped from the warner bros name warner bros also founded the casablanca records subsidiary headed by neil bogart but several years later casablanca would become independent of warner bros worldwide distributionedit with the elektra acquisition the next step was forming an inhouse distribution arm for the coowned labels by this time warnerreprises frustrations with its current distributors had reached breaking point joe smith then executive vicepresident of warner bros recalled that the grateful dead were becoming a major act but the distributor was constantly out of stock of their albums these circumstances facilitated the full establishment of the groups inhouse distribution arm initially called kinney record group international by late  us antitrust laws had changed and the company was renamed warnerelektraatlantic wea for short which was renamed warner music in  the word group was added after the formation of aol time warner wea was an early champion of the heavy metal rock music several such bands including the three major pioneers led zeppelin black sabbath and deep purple were all signed to weas labels at least in the united states among the earliest american metal acts to be signed to wea were alice cooper montrose and van halen up to this point the kinneyowned record companies had relied on licensing deals with overseas record labels to manufacture distribute and promote its products in other countries concurrent with the establishment of its new distribution arm the company now began establishing subsidiaries in the other major markets beginning with the creation of warner bros records australia in  soon followed by branch offices in the uk europe and japan in july  the new inhouse distribution company was incorporated as warnerelektraatlantic distributing corp wea and branch offices were established in eight major us cities joel friedman a onetime billboard writer who had been the head of warners advertisingmerchandising division in its early years was appointed to head weas us domestic division and ahmet erteguns brother nesuhi was appointed to oversee its international operations neshui ertegun originally a turkish native like his brother displayed a global perspective and independence from its us counterpart by successfully promoting international acts in their target markets worldwide ertegun headed wea international until his retirement in  a de facto committee of three senior marketing executives—dave glew from atlantic ed rosenblatt from warner bros and mel posner from elektra—oversaw the integration of each labels marketing and distribution through the new division but each label continued to operate totally independently in ar matters and also applied their own expertise in marketing and advertising on july   following the pattern set by similar joint ventures in canada and australia the warner labels entered into a partnership with the british arm of cbs records to press and distribute warnerreprise product in the united kingdom although this was undertaken as a cooperative venture rather than a formally incorporated business partnership the billboard article that reported the new arrangement also noted that despite their intense competition in the us market cbs continued to press warnerreprise recordings in the usa however the new uk arrangement was a major blow to warners previous british manufacturer pye records for whom warnerreprise had been their largest account with the scheduled addition of the uk rights to the atlantic catalogue which would revert to kinney in early  billboard predicted that the warnercbs partnership would have a – share of the uk music market in april  thanks mainly to the influence of ahmet ertegun the kinney group announced a major coup with its acquisition of the worldwide rights to the rolling stones new label rolling stones records following the expiration of the bands contract with british decca then separate from the american label and the acrimonious end to their business relationship with their former manager allen klein under the terms of the deal atlantic subsidiary atco would distribute the stones recordings in the usa with other territories mainly handled by warner bros international divisions one of kinneys wisest investments was fleetwood mac the band signed to reprise in the early s after relocating to the usa and the label supported them through numerous lineup changes and several lean years during which the bands records sold relatively poorly although they remained a popular concert attraction ironically after their transfer to warner bros in  and the recruitment of new members lindsay buckingham and stevie nicks the group scored a major international hit with the single rhiannon and consolidated with the best selling albums fleetwood mac rumours and tusk warner communicationsedit due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations kinney national spun off its nonentertainment assets in  as national kinney corporation and changed its name to warner communications inc in  the warner group acquired another rich prize david geffens asylum records the  million purchase brought in several acts who would prove crucial the warner groups subsequent success including linda ronstadt the eagles jackson browne joni mitchell and later warren zevon on the downside however it was rumored that warners was soon concerned about their possible liability under the california state labor code because of geffens questionable status as both the manager of most of the asylum acts and the head of the record label to which they were signed the sale included the asylum records label and its recordings as well as geffens lucrative music publishing assets and the interests in the royalties of some of the artists managed by geffen and partner elliot roberts geffen accepted a fiveyear contract with wci and turned over his  share in the geffenroberts management company to roberts and warners paid geffen and roberts  common shares worth  at the time of the sale plus  in cash and a further  million in promissory notes convertible to common stock although it seemed a lucrative deal at the time geffen soon had reason to regret it uncharacteristically he had greatly underestimated the value of his assets—within asylums first year as a warner subsidiary albums by linda ronstadt and the eagles alone had earned more than the entire value of the asylum sale geffens discomfort was compounded by the fact that within six months of the sale the value of his volatile warner shares had plummeted from  million to just  he appealed to steve ross to intervene and as part of a makegood deal ross agreed to pay him the difference in the share value over five years acting on jac holzmans suggestion that kinney should take asylum from atlantic and merge it with elektra ross then appointed geffen to run the new combined label in  warner gained a brief early lead in digital media when it purchased the atari computer company and in  it bought the franklin mint company wci also blazed the trail in visual music with mtv which it created and coowned in partnership with american express in – warner rapidly divested many of these recent acquisitions including atari franklin mint panavision mtv networks and a cosmetics business in  warnerelektraatlantic formed pacific records for their composers and distributed appropriately by atlantic records alan oday was the first artist signed to the label and the first release was undercover angel the song which he described as a nocturnal novelette was in february  within a few months it had become  in the country and has sold approximately two million copies it was also a hit in australia reaching  on the australian singles chart undercover angel also landed oday in an exclusive club as one of only a handful of writersperformers to pen a  hit for themselves and a  for another artist new signings in the late s placed wea in a strong position for the s a deal with seymour steins sire records label which warner bros records later took over brought in several major punk rock and new wave acts including the pretenders the ramones and talking heads and most importantly rising star madonna elektra signed the cars and warner bros signed prince giving wea several of the biggestselling acts of the decade weas labels also distributed a number of otherwise independent labels for example warner bros distributed straight records discreet records bizarre records bearsville records and geffen records the latter was sold to mca in  atlantic records distributed swan song records in  wea scored a major coup by signing a distribution agreement with island records which only covered the united states and select other countries for the next  years initially with warner bros until  then with atlantic afterward wea would distribute such artists as bob marley u robert palmer anthrax and tom waits this relationship ended when island was sold to polygram in  sedit a proposed  international merger between polygram and wea was forbidden by both the us federal

corporate changes within the warner group of labels continued after the time warner merger—in  wea purchased french label carrere records wea was renamed warner music group in  leading french

elektra records in  interscope was purchased by mca music entertainment during  the warner music group faced one of the most serious publicrelations crises in its history when a major controversy erupted over the provocative warner bros recording cop killer from the selftitled album by body count a heavy metalrap fusion band led by icet unfortunately for warner the song which mentioned the rodney king case was issued just before the controversial acquittal of the police charged with kings beating which sparked the  los angeles riots and the confluence of events put the song under the national spotlight complaints escalated over the summer—conservative police associations called for a boycott of time warner products politicians including president george h w bush denounced the label for releasing the song warner executives received death threats time warner stockholders threatened to pull out of the company and the new zealand police commissioner unsuccessfully tried to have the record banned there although icet later voluntarily reissued body count without cop killer the furor seriously rattled warner music and in january  the label made an undisclosed deal releasing icet from his contract and returning the body count master tapes to him also in  the rhino records label signed a distribution agreement with atlantic records and time warner bought a  stake in the rhino records label the distribution agreement allowed rhino to begin reissuing recordings from atlantics back catalogue in  canadian beverage giant seagram bought a  stake in time warner and the warner publishing division—now called warnerchappell music – acquired cppbelwin becoming the worlds largest owner of song copyrights and the worlds largest publisher of printed music in  time warner made another dramatic expansion of its media holdings taking over the turner broadcasting system which by then included the turner cable tv network cnn and the screen production houses castle rock entertainment and new line cinema acquisitions that would bring huge profits into the warner group thanks to content assets like seinfeld and the highly successful the lord of the rings film trilogy by the early s senior warner staff like ostin and waronker had remained in their positions for several decades—a highly unusual situation in the american music industry—but the death of steve ross destabilized the time warner hierarchy and over the next few years the music group was increasingly disrupted by internal power struggles leading to a string of major executive upheavals in – which the new york times described as a virtual civil war the central conflict was between mo ostin and warner music group chairman robert morgado who had joined the warner group in the late s because of his political background he had been the chiefofstaff to former new york governor hugh l carey and his lack of music industry experience—especially compared to the widely revered ostin—morgado was viewed as an outsider at warner nevertheless he gained favour with ross and levin and was promoted in  to oversee the warner international music division after helping the company slash costs in its computer game sector since his appointment as head of wbr ostin had always reported directly to steve ross and rosss successor gerald levin but in late  when ostins contract came up for renewal morgado asserted his authority insisting that ostin should now report directly to him the tensions between them reached boiling point in july  when morgado appointed former atlantic chief doug morris to head the warner music group in the usa a decision that many saw as a deliberate move to hasten the departure of ostin and elektra head robert krasnow morgados new structure was announced in august  and bob krasnow resigned from elektra the next day within days after more than  years with the warner music group and more than  years as president and chairman of warner bros records ostin announced he would not renew his current contract and would leave warners when it expired on december   there was more negative publicity the following month when leading elektra act metallica launched a lawsuit against the label seeking a release from their contract and ownership of their master tapes and claiming that morgado had refused to honour a deal they had worked out with krasnow before he quit ostins departure marked a seismic shift in the corporate culture at wbr and the news was greeted with dismay by industry insiders and the many artists whose careers he had helped to nurture lenny waronker had agreed to take over as wbr chairman and ceo but in october  he announced that he would not be taking up the position he initially said that he would remain as president of wbr but by this time there was already widespread speculation that he would leave and he did so soon afterwards the following year he rejoined ostin and son michael as joint head of the newly launched dreamworks label beginning in august  morgado alienated morris by his clumsy handling of warners relationship with interscope records the successful label founded by ted field and jimmy iovine and partowned by warner morgado had resisted making a decision about increasing the warner stake in interscope which encouraged other companies to make overtures to the label in response morgado threatened to send ceaseanddesist notices to executives at several record companies demanding that they stop approaching interscope with buyout offers a move that reportedly infuriated iovine by late  morris was gaining the upper hand over his rival and media reports claimed that morris had moved to settle with metallica offering a deal that was reportedly even more generous than the one they had worked out with krasnow morgado now faced a showdown with morris who felt he was not being allowed to run wmg as he saw fit in october  morris and  other warner executives staged an unprecedented insurrection that nearly paralyzed the worlds largest record company this led to a climactic meeting between morris and gerald levin in late october at which morris reportedly threatened to quit if he had to continue to report to morgado morgado gave in to the demand that morris be granted autonomy to run the north american operations and he was forced to upgrade morriss position from chief operating officer to chief executive of warner music group usa morris promptly named danny goldberg former president of atlantic records to run wbr in defiance of morgado who had a different candidate in mind and levin also reduced morgados power to oversee warners mailorder record club division and its international operations morris then brought in sylvia rhone and seymour stein to stabilize elektra settled the metallica lawsuit and persuaded levin to purchase an additional  of interscope although this initiative proved shortlived the power struggle between morgado and morris reached a dramatic climax in may  when morgado was asked to resign by gerald levin following a welter of complaints from executives at the three major warner music labels who said that morgado was undermining morriss authority and damaging warners reputation among performers morgado was immediately replaced by hbo chairman michael j fuchs but the corporate upheavals did not end there in late june  fuchs abruptly dismissed doug morris saying that morris had been leading a campaign to destabilize warner music in an effort to seize control of the company as morriss strongest ally danny goldberg was also under threat he was initially told that he could stay on as president of wbr as long as he refrained from office politics and concentrate on the daytoday management of the label but he resigned as president of warner bros records soon after to pursue other interests and was replaced by wbr vicechairman russ thyret despite early success with dr dre and snoop dogg and morriss decision to increase warners stake to  by the mids interscope records was being seen as a liability for the warner group time warners board and investors had already been bruised by the damaging  cop killer controversy and now they were faced with renewed criticism about the gangsta rap genre in which interscopes associate imprint death row records was a key label in mid time warner refused to distribute the interscope album dogg food by tha dogg pound forcing the label to seek outside distribution and late in the year tw sold its stake in death row back to coowners jimmy iovine and ted field and soon after it sold off its share in interscope to mca music entertainment the upheaval at warner was beneficial to its rivals who picked up valuable executives who had left warner goldberg moved over to mercury records morris joined mca music entertainment group and led its reorganization into universal music group now the worlds largest record company in november  fuchs was himself sacked by levin leaving the company with a reported us million golden parachute and time warner cochairmen robert a daly and terry semel took over the running of the music division in  seagram boss edgar bronfman jr held talks aimed at merging seagrams universal music headed by morris with the venerable british recording company emi but the discussions came to nothing bronfman then oversaw universals takeover by vivendi wea meanwhile continued to expand its publishing empire buying a  stake in the italian recording and music publishing group nuova fonit cetra also in  time warner bought the remaining  of the rhino records label they did not own the rhino records retail store in los angeles was not included rhino then began reissuing the back catalogues of the warnerreprise and elektraasylum labels in  rhino launched rhino handmade which released limitededition reissues of lesserknown but stillsignificant recordings from the wea labels sedit in  time warner merged with leading american internet service provider aol to create aol time warner the new conglomerate again tried and failed to acquire emi and subsequent discussions about the takeover of bmg stalled with bertelsmann eventually offloading bmg into a joint venture with sony in  aoltw further consolidated its hold over the publishing industry buying  of music publisher deston songs from edel ag by the early s however the effects of the dotcom crash had eroded aols profits and stock value and in  the time warner board sidelined its underperforming partner by dropping aol from its business name looking to reduce its debt load time warner—the corporate successor to warner communications—sold warner music group in  to a group of investors led by edgar bronfman jr for us billion this spinoff was completed on february   in the  transition to independent ownership wmg hired record industry heavyweight lyor cohen from universal music group the result of the merger between the polygram and mca label families to attempt to reduce cost and increase performance contrary to common belief time warner no longer retains any ownership in wmg though it had the option to reacquire up to  of wmg for three years following the closing of the transaction wmgs current logo is the former warner communications logo originally designed by saul bass and is used under license by its former parent which retains full ownership and control of the warner trademarks once free of time warner wmg began cutting costs by offloading lossmaking or lowearning divisions like its rival emi warner reacted to the growth of the digital music market by making a historic change moving out of record production by closing or selling off discpressing plants particularly in territories such as the usa and the netherlands where production costs are high the us manufacturing operations were sold to cinram in  before the purchase from time warner in  the miamibased warner bros publications which printed and distributed a broad selection of

publishing arm warnerchappell music citing copyright infringement although a number of artists were not signed with the label although the majority of the blocked videos are not official content of

records which was a division of rival paramount pictures in order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies and to also capitalize on the music business warner bros records was created in  warner purchased reprise records which had been founded by frank sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings with the reprise acquisition warner gained the services of mo ostin who would be mainly responsible for the success of warnerreprise the canadian unit was opened in  as warner reprise canada ltd now called warner music canada co after warner bros was sold to seven arts productions in  forming warner brosseven arts it purchased atlantic records founded in  and wmgs oldest label until wmg completed its acquisition of parlophone in  as well as its subsidiary atco records this acquisition brought neil young into the company fold initially as a member of buffalo springfield young would become one of warners longestestablished artists recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the warnerowned atlantic atco and reprise labels as well as making five albums for geffen records during that labels period of warner distribution the geffen catalogue now owned by universal music group represents youngs only major recordings not under wmg ownership in  two years after being purchased by seven arts the warner brosseven arts company was sold to the kinney national company kinney later changing its name to warner communications combined the operations of all of its record labels and kinney ceo steve ross led the group through its most successful period until his death in  an earlier attempt by warner bros records to create an inhouse distribution arm in  didnt materialize so in  elektra records boss jac holzman approached atlantics jerry wexler with the idea of setting up a joint distribution network for warner elektra and atlantic an experimental branch was established in southern california as a possible prototype for an expanded operation atlantic its subsidiary atco records and its affiliate stax records paved the way for warners rise to industry prominence the purchase brought in atlantics lucrative backcatalogue which included classic recordings by ray charles the drifters the coasters and many more in the mid s atlanticstax had released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including booker t  the mgs sam  dave wilson pickett otis redding ben e king and aretha franklin but the sale led to stax leaving the atlantic fold because the new warner owners insisted on keeping the rights to stax recordings however atlantic also moved decisively into rock and pop in the late s and s signing major british and american acts including led zeppelin cream crosby stills  nash yes emerson lake  palmer average white band dr john king crimson bette midler roxy music and foreigner atlantic exerts autonomyedit it was soon apparent in  that atlanticatco president ahmet ertegün viewed warnerreprise president mike maitland as a rival maitland believed that as vicepresident in charge of the warner brosseven arts music division he should have final say over all recording operations and he further angered ertegün by proposing that most of atlantics backoffice functions such as marketing and distribution be combined with the existing departments at warnerreprise in retrospect ertegün clearly feared that maitland would ultimately have more power than him and so he moved rapidly to secure his own position and remove maitland maitland had put off renegotiating the contracts of joe smith and mo ostin the presidents of the warner bros and reprise labels and this provided ertegün with an effective means of undermining maitland when wexler—now a major shareholder—found out about the contract issue he and ertegün began pressuring eliot hyman to get smith and ostin under contract ostensibly because they were worried that the two executives might move to rival labels—and in fact ostin had received overtures from both the mgm and abc labels in  the wisdom of hymans investments was proved when kinney national company purchased warner brosseven arts for  million more than eight times what hyman had paid for warnerreprise and atlantic combined from the base of his familys funeral parlour business kinney president steve ross had rapidly built the kinney company into a profitable conglomerate with interests that included comic publishing the ashleyfamous talent agency parking lots and cleaning services following the takeover warners music group briefly adopted the umbrella name kinney music because us antitrust laws at the time prevented the three labels from trading as one ross was primarily focused on rebuilding the companys ailing movie division and was happy to defer to the advice of the managers of the companys record labels since he knew that they were generating most of the groups profits erteguns campaign against maitland began in earnest that summer atlantic had agreed to help warner bros in its efforts to establish its labels overseas beginning with its soontobeestablished warner bros subsidiary in australia but when warner executive phil rose arrived in australia he discovered that just one week earlier atlantic had signed a new fouryear distribution deal with a rival local label festival records owned by rupert murdochs news limited mike maitland complained bitterly to kinney executive ted ashley but to no avail – by this time ertegun was poised to make his move against maitland as he had with hyman ertegun urged steve ross to extend mo ostin and joe smiths contracts a recommendation ross was happy to accept ostin however had received overtures from other companies including mgm records and abc records and when he met with ertegun in january  and was offered maitlands job he was unwilling to resign immediately in response ertegun broadly hinted that maitlands days were numbered and that he ertegun was about to take over the recording division unlike the warnerreprise executives atlantics execs the ertegun brothers ahmet and neshui and wexler owned stock in kinney ostin was understandably concerned that if he accepted the position the warner bros staff would feel that he had stabbed maitland in the back but his attorney convinced him that maitlands departure was inevitable regardless of whether or not he accepted the post succinctly advising him dont be a schmuck on sunday january  ted ashley went to maitlands house to tell him he had been dismissed and maitland declined the offer of a job at the movie studio one week later mo ostin was named as the new president of warner bros records with joe smith as his executive vicepresident ertegun nominally remained the head of atlantic but since both ostin and smith owed their new positions to him ertegun was now the de facto head of the warner music division ertegun was given the formal title of executive vicepresidentmusic group maitland moved to mca records later that year and successfully consolidated mcas labels which he couldnt do at warner sedit during the s the kinney group built up a commanding position in the music industry in  kinney bought elektra records and its sister label nonesuch records founded by jac holzman in  for  million bringing in leading rock acts including the doors tim buckley and love and its historically significant folk archive along with the successful budget western classicalmusic label nonesuch records the purchase of elektranonesuch brought a rich back catalogue of folk music as well as the renowned nonesuch catalogue of classical and world music elektra founder jac holzman ran the label under warners for two years but by that time he was by his own admission burnt out after twenty years in the business kinney president steve ross subsequently appointed holzman as part of a sevenperson brains trust tasked with investigating opportunities presented by new technologies a role holzman was eager to accept the same year the group established its first overseas offices in canada and australia by that time the seven arts moniker was dropped from the warner bros name warner bros also founded the casablanca records subsidiary headed by neil bogart but several years later casablanca would become independent of warner bros worldwide distributionedit with the elektra acquisition the next step was forming an inhouse distribution arm for the coowned labels by this time warnerreprises frustrations with its current distributors had reached breaking point joe smith then executive vicepresident of warner bros recalled that the grateful dead were becoming a major act but the distributor was constantly out of stock of their albums these circumstances facilitated the full establishment of the groups inhouse distribution arm initially called kinney record group international by late  us antitrust laws had changed and the company was renamed warnerelektraatlantic wea for short which was renamed warner music in  the word group was added after the formation of aol time warner wea was an early champion of the heavy metal rock music several such bands including the three major pioneers led zeppelin black sabbath and deep purple were all signed to weas labels at least in the united states among the earliest american metal acts to be signed to wea were alice cooper montrose and van halen up to this point the kinneyowned record companies had relied on licensing deals with overseas record labels to manufacture distribute and promote its products in other countries concurrent with the establishment of its new distribution arm the company now began establishing subsidiaries in the other major markets beginning with the creation of warner bros records australia in  soon followed by branch offices in the uk europe and japan in july  the new inhouse distribution company was incorporated as warnerelektraatlantic distributing corp wea and branch offices were established in eight major us cities joel friedman a onetime billboard writer who had been the head of warners advertisingmerchandising division in its early years was appointed to head weas us domestic division and ahmet erteguns brother nesuhi was appointed to oversee its international operations neshui ertegun originally a turkish native like his brother displayed a global perspective and independence from its us counterpart by successfully promoting international acts in their target markets worldwide ertegun headed wea international until his retirement in  a de facto committee of three senior marketing executives—dave glew from atlantic ed rosenblatt from warner bros and mel posner from elektra—oversaw the integration of each labels marketing and distribution through the new division but each label continued to operate totally independently in ar matters and also applied their own expertise in marketing and advertising on july   following the pattern set by similar joint ventures in canada and australia the warner labels entered into a partnership with the british arm of cbs records to press and distribute warnerreprise product in the united kingdom although this was undertaken as a cooperative venture rather than a formally incorporated business partnership the billboard article that reported the new arrangement also noted that despite their intense competition in the us market cbs continued to press warnerreprise recordings in the usa however the new uk arrangement was a major blow to warners previous british manufacturer pye records for whom warnerreprise had been their largest account with the scheduled addition of the uk rights to the atlantic catalogue which would revert to kinney in early  billboard predicted that the warnercbs partnership would have a – share of the uk music market in april  thanks mainly to the influence of ahmet ertegun the kinney group announced a major coup with its acquisition of the worldwide rights to the rolling stones new label rolling stones records following the expiration of the bands contract with british decca then separate from the american label and the acrimonious end to their business relationship with their former manager allen klein under the terms of the deal atlantic subsidiary atco would distribute the stones recordings in the usa with other territories mainly handled by warner bros international divisions one of kinneys wisest investments was fleetwood mac the band signed to reprise in the early s after relocating to the usa and the label supported them through numerous lineup changes and several lean years during which the bands records sold relatively poorly although they remained a popular concert attraction ironically after their transfer to warner bros in  and the recruitment of new members lindsay buckingham and stevie nicks the group scored a major international hit with the single rhiannon and consolidated with the best selling albums fleetwood mac rumours and tusk warner communicationsedit due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations kinney national spun off its nonentertainment assets in  as national kinney corporation and changed its name to warner communications inc in  the warner group acquired another rich prize david geffens asylum records the  million purchase brought in several acts who would prove crucial the warner groups subsequent success including linda ronstadt the eagles jackson browne joni mitchell and later warren zevon on the downside however it was rumored that warners was soon concerned about their possible liability under the california state labor code because of geffens questionable status as both the manager of most of the asylum acts and the head of the record label to which they were signed the sale included the asylum records label and its recordings as well as geffens lucrative music publishing assets and the interests in the royalties of some of the artists managed by geffen and partner elliot roberts geffen accepted a fiveyear contract with wci and turned over his  share in the geffenroberts management company to roberts and warners paid geffen and roberts  common shares worth  at the time of the sale plus  in cash and a further  million in promissory notes convertible to common stock although it seemed a lucrative deal at the time geffen soon had reason to regret it uncharacteristically he had greatly underestimated the value of his assets—within asylums first year as a warner subsidiary albums by linda ronstadt and the eagles alone had earned more than the entire value of the asylum sale geffens discomfort was compounded by the fact that within six months of the sale the value of his volatile warner shares had plummeted from  million to just  he appealed to steve ross to intervene and as part of a makegood deal ross agreed to pay him the difference in the share value over five years acting on jac holzmans suggestion that kinney should take asylum from atlantic and merge it with elektra ross then appointed geffen to run the new combined label in  warner gained a brief early lead in digital media when it purchased the atari computer company and in  it bought the franklin mint company wci also blazed the trail in visual music with mtv which it created and coowned in partnership with american express in – warner rapidly divested many of these recent acquisitions including atari franklin mint panavision mtv networks and a cosmetics business in  warnerelektraatlantic formed pacific records for their composers and distributed appropriately by atlantic records alan oday was the first artist signed to the label and the first release was undercover angel the song which he described as a nocturnal novelette was in february  within a few months it had become  in the country and has sold approximately two million copies it was also a hit in australia reaching  on the australian singles chart undercover angel also landed oday in an exclusive club as one of only a handful of writersperformers to pen a  hit for themselves and a  for another artist new signings in the late s placed wea in a strong position for the s a deal with seymour steins sire records label which warner bros records later took over brought in several major punk rock and new wave acts including the pretenders the ramones and talking heads and most importantly rising star madonna elektra signed the cars and warner bros signed prince giving wea several of the biggestselling acts of the decade weas labels also distributed a number of otherwise independent labels for example warner bros distributed straight records discreet records bizarre records bearsville records and geffen records the latter was sold to mca in  atlantic records distributed swan song records in  wea scored a major coup by signing a distribution agreement with island records which only covered the united states and select other countries for the next  years initially with warner bros until  then with atlantic afterward wea would distribute such artists as bob marley u robert palmer anthrax and tom waits this relationship ended when island was sold to polygram in  sedit a proposed  international merger between polygram and wea was forbidden by both the us federal trade commission and west germanys cartel office so polygrams halfowner philips then purchased a further  of the company from its partner siemens and bought the remaining shares in  the same year polygram divested its film and publishing operations closed polygram pictures and sold chappell music to warner for us million wea signed with mca records a distribution agreement of this discographic house outside us in  which lasted until  wea formed wea manufacturing in  in  wea took over the german classical label teldec and the british magnet label in  it was announced that warner communications was to merge with time inc to form time warner a transaction that was completed in  following the merger wea continued acquiring independent labels buying cgd records italy and mmg records japan in  sedit through the s time warner was the largest media company in the world with assets in excess of us billion and annual revenues in the billions of dollars by  warners music labels were generating sales valued at more than us billion with operating profits of  million and by  its music division dominated the us music industry with a  share of the domestic market acquisitions and corporate changes within the warner group of labels continued after the time warner merger—in  wea purchased french label carrere records wea was renamed warner music group in  leading french classical label erato  and in  wea bought the spanish dro records hungarys magneoton label the swedish telegram records brazils continental records and finnish label fazer musiiki also miguel tomas lucio was signed to the label atlantic launched two new subsidiary labels in the early s east west records and interscope records in  east west absorbed atco records and was eventually folded into elektra records in  interscope was purchased by mca music entertainment during  the warner music group faced one of the most serious publicrelations crises in its history when a major controversy erupted over the provocative warner bros recording cop killer from the selftitled album by body count a heavy metalrap fusion band led by icet unfortunately for warner the song which mentioned the rodney king case was issued just before the controversial acquittal of the police charged with kings beating which sparked the  los angeles riots and the confluence of events put the song under the national spotlight complaints escalated over the summer—conservative police associations called for a boycott of time warner products politicians including president george h w bush denounced the label for releasing the song warner executives received death threats time warner stockholders threatened to pull out of the company and the new zealand police commissioner unsuccessfully tried to have the record banned there although icet later voluntarily reissued body count without cop killer the furor seriously rattled warner music and in january  the label made an undisclosed deal releasing icet from his contract and returning the body count master tapes to him also in  the rhino records label signed a distribution agreement with atlantic records and time warner bought a  stake in the rhino records label the distribution agreement allowed rhino to begin reissuing recordings from atlantics back catalogue in  canadian beverage giant seagram bought a  stake in time warner and the warner publishing division—now called warnerchappell music – acquired cppbelwin becoming the worlds largest owner of song copyrights and the worlds largest publisher of printed music in  time warner made another dramatic expansion of its media holdings taking over the turner broadcasting system which by then included the turner cable tv network cnn and the screen production houses castle rock entertainment and new line cinema acquisitions that would bring huge profits into the warner group thanks to content assets like seinfeld and the highly successful the lord of the rings film trilogy by the early s senior warner staff like ostin and waronker had remained in their positions for several decades—a highly unusual situation in the american music industry—but the death of steve ross destabilized the time warner hierarchy and over the next few years the music group was increasingly disrupted by internal power struggles leading to a string of major executive upheavals in – which the new york times described as a virtual civil war the central conflict was between mo ostin and warner music group chairman robert morgado who had joined the warner group in the late s because of his political background he had been the chiefofstaff to former new york governor hugh l carey and his lack of music industry experience—especially compared to the widely revered ostin—morgado was viewed as an outsider at warner nevertheless he gained favour with ross and levin and was promoted in  to oversee the warner international music division after helping the company slash costs in its computer game sector since his appointment as head of wbr ostin had always reported directly to steve ross and rosss successor gerald levin but in late  when ostins contract came up for renewal morgado asserted his authority insisting that ostin should now report directly to him the tensions between them reached boiling point in july  when morgado appointed former atlantic chief doug morris to head the warner music group in the usa a decision that many saw as a deliberate move to hasten the departure of ostin and elektra head robert krasnow morgados new structure was announced in august  and bob krasnow resigned from elektra the next day within days after more than  years with the warner music group and more than  years as president and chairman of warner bros records ostin announced he would not renew his current contract and would leave warners when it expired on december   there was more negative publicity the following month when leading elektra act metallica launched a lawsuit against the label seeking a release from their contract and ownership of their master tapes and claiming that morgado had refused to honour a deal they had worked out with krasnow before he quit ostins departure marked a seismic shift in the corporate culture at wbr and the news was greeted with dismay by industry insiders and the many artists whose careers he had helped to nurture lenny waronker had agreed to take over as wbr chairman and ceo but in october  he announced that he would not be taking up the position he initially said that he would remain as president of wbr but by this time there was already widespread speculation that he would leave and he did so soon afterwards the following year he rejoined ostin and son michael as joint head of the newly launched dreamworks label beginning in august  morgado alienated morris by his clumsy handling of warners relationship with interscope records the successful label founded by ted field and jimmy iovine and partowned by warner morgado had resisted making a decision about increasing the warner stake in interscope which encouraged other companies to make overtures to the label in response morgado threatened to send ceaseanddesist notices to executives at several record companies demanding that they stop approaching interscope with buyout offers a move that reportedly infuriated iovine by late  morris was gaining the upper hand over his rival and media reports claimed that morris had moved to settle with metallica offering a deal that was reportedly even more generous than the one they had worked out with krasnow morgado now faced a showdown with morris who felt he was not being allowed to run wmg as he saw fit in october  morris and  other warner executives staged an unprecedented insurrection that nearly paralyzed the worlds largest record company this led to a climactic meeting between morris and gerald levin in late october at which morris reportedly threatened to quit if he had to continue to report to morgado morgado gave in to the demand that morris be granted autonomy to run the north american operations and he was forced to upgrade morriss position from chief operating officer to chief executive of warner music group usa morris promptly named danny goldberg former president of atlantic records to run wbr in defiance of morgado who had a different candidate in mind and levin also reduced morgados power to oversee warners mailorder record club division and its international operations morris then brought in sylvia rhone and seymour stein to stabilize elektra settled the metallica lawsuit and persuaded levin to purchase an additional  of interscope although this initiative proved shortlived the power struggle between morgado and morris reached a dramatic climax in may  when morgado was asked to resign by gerald levin following a welter of complaints from executives at the three major warner music labels who said that morgado was undermining morriss authority and damaging warners reputation among performers morgado was immediately replaced by hbo chairman michael j fuchs but the corporate upheavals did not end there in late june  fuchs abruptly dismissed doug morris saying that morris had been leading a campaign to destabilize warner music in an effort to seize control of the company as morriss strongest ally danny goldberg was also under threat he was initially told that he could stay on as president of wbr as long as he refrained from office politics and concentrate on the daytoday management of the label but he resigned as president of warner bros records soon after to pursue other interests and was replaced by wbr vicechairman russ thyret despite early success with dr dre and snoop dogg and morriss decision to increase warners stake to  by the mids interscope records was being seen as a liability for the warner group time warners board and investors had already been bruised by the damaging  cop killer controversy and now they were faced with renewed criticism about the gangsta rap genre in which interscopes associate imprint death row records was a key label in mid time warner refused to distribute the interscope album dogg food by tha dogg pound forcing the label to seek outside distribution and late in the year tw sold its stake in death row back to coowners jimmy iovine and ted field and soon after it sold off its share in interscope to mca music entertainment the upheaval at warner was beneficial to its rivals who picked up valuable executives who had left warner goldberg moved over to mercury records morris joined mca music entertainment group and led its reorganization into universal music group now the worlds largest record company in november  fuchs was himself sacked by levin leaving the company with a reported us million golden parachute and time warner cochairmen robert a daly and terry semel took over the running of the music division in  seagram boss edgar bronfman jr held talks aimed at merging seagrams universal music headed by morris with the venerable british recording company emi but the discussions came to nothing bronfman then oversaw universals takeover by vivendi wea meanwhile continued to expand its publishing empire buying a  stake in the italian recording and music publishing group nuova fonit cetra also in  time warner bought the remaining  of the rhino records label they did not own the rhino records retail store in los angeles was not included rhino then began reissuing the back catalogues of the warnerreprise and elektraasylum labels in  rhino launched rhino handmade which released limitededition reissues of lesserknown but stillsignificant recordings from the wea labels sedit in  time warner merged with leading american internet service provider aol to create aol time warner the new conglomerate again tried and failed to acquire emi and subsequent discussions about the takeover of bmg stalled with bertelsmann eventually offloading bmg into a joint venture with sony in  aoltw further consolidated its hold over the publishing industry buying  of music publisher deston songs from edel ag by the early s however the effects of the dotcom crash had eroded aols profits and stock value and in  the time warner board sidelined its underperforming partner by dropping aol from its business name looking to reduce its debt load time warner—the corporate successor to warner communications—sold warner music group in  to a group of investors led by edgar bronfman jr for us billion this spinoff was completed on february   in the  transition to independent ownership wmg hired record industry heavyweight lyor cohen from universal music group the result of the merger between the polygram and mca label families to attempt to reduce cost and increase performance contrary to common belief time warner no longer retains any ownership in wmg though it had the option to reacquire up to  of wmg for three years following the closing of the transaction wmgs current logo is the former warner communications logo originally designed by saul bass and is used under license by its former parent which retains full ownership and control of the warner trademarks once free of time warner wmg began cutting costs by offloading lossmaking or lowearning divisions like its rival emi warner reacted to the growth of the digital music market by making a historic change moving out of record production by closing or selling off discpressing plants particularly in territories such as the usa and the netherlands where production costs are high the us manufacturing operations were sold to cinram in  before the purchase from time warner in  the miamibased warner bros publications which printed and distributed a broad selection of sheet music books educational material orchestrations arrangements and tutorials was sold to alfred music publishing although the sale excluded the print music business of wmgs word music church hymnals choral music and associated instrumental music on may   wmg apparently rejected a buyout offer from emi then wmg offered to buy emi and it also rejected the offer in august  emi was purchased by terra firma capital partners talk of a possible wmg acquisition of emi was fanned once again in  after wmg executed a bond offering for  billion which brought to light wmgs relatively strong financial position which was contrasted with the weakened and debtladen state of emi the same year wmg acquired rykodisc and roadrunner records on december   warner announced that it would sell digital music without digital rights management through amazonmp making it the third major label to do so in  the new york times reported that wmgs atlantic records became the first major record label

negotiations between wmg and youtube broke down as a result warner music group has continuously blocked or muted videos on youtube that feature music recordings belonging to its labels or to its publishing arm warnerchappell music citing copyright infringement although a number of artists were not signed with the label although the majority of the blocked videos are not official content of wmg they include wmg recordings in a minor way normally covered by fair use many of these claims to copyright violation not only affect artists who are under record labels owned or distributed by wmg but also to artists who have songs published and controlled by warnerchappell regardless of label the issue and opinion of wmg worsened when they began removing and muting songs that are covers rather than just recordings but on september   cnet reported that warner music group had possibly struck a new deal with youtube and wmg videos may start appearing back on youtube within weeks and it was

records which was a division of rival paramount pictures in order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies and to also capitalize on the music business warner bros records was created in  warner purchased reprise records which had been founded by frank sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings with the reprise acquisition warner gained the services of mo ostin who would be mainly responsible for the success of warnerreprise the canadian unit was opened in  as warner reprise canada ltd now called warner music canada co after warner bros was sold to seven arts productions in  forming warner brosseven arts it purchased atlantic records founded in  and wmgs oldest label until wmg completed its acquisition of parlophone in  as well as its subsidiary atco records this acquisition brought neil young into the company fold initially as a member of buffalo springfield young would become one of warners longestestablished artists recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the warnerowned atlantic atco and reprise labels as well as making five albums for geffen records during that labels period of warner distribution the geffen catalogue now owned by universal music group represents youngs only major recordings not under wmg ownership in  two years after being purchased by seven arts the warner brosseven arts company was sold to the kinney national company kinney later changing its name to warner communications combined the operations of all of its record labels and kinney ceo steve ross led the group through its most successful period until his death in  an earlier attempt by warner bros records to create an inhouse distribution arm in  didnt materialize so in  elektra records boss jac holzman approached atlantics jerry wexler with the idea of setting up a joint distribution network for warner elektra and atlantic an experimental branch was established in southern california as a possible prototype for an expanded operation atlantic its subsidiary atco records and its affiliate stax records paved the way for warners rise to industry prominence the purchase brought in atlantics lucrative backcatalogue which included classic recordings by ray charles the drifters the coasters and many more in the mid s atlanticstax had released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including booker t  the mgs sam  dave wilson pickett otis redding ben e king and aretha franklin but the sale led to stax leaving the atlantic fold because the new warner owners insisted on keeping the rights to stax recordings however atlantic also moved decisively into rock and pop in the late s and s signing major british and american acts including led zeppelin cream crosby stills  nash yes emerson lake  palmer average white band dr john king crimson bette midler roxy music and foreigner atlantic exerts autonomyedit it was soon apparent in  that atlanticatco president ahmet ertegün viewed warnerreprise president mike maitland as a rival maitland believed that as vicepresident in charge of the warner brosseven arts music division he should have final say over all recording operations and he further angered ertegün by proposing that most of atlantics backoffice functions such as marketing and distribution be combined with the existing departments at warnerreprise in retrospect ertegün clearly feared that maitland would ultimately have more power than him and so he moved rapidly to secure his own position and remove maitland maitland had put off renegotiating the contracts of joe smith and mo ostin the presidents of the warner bros and reprise labels and this provided ertegün with an effective means of undermining maitland when wexler—now a major shareholder—found out about the contract issue he and ertegün began pressuring eliot hyman to get smith and ostin under contract ostensibly because they were worried that the two executives might move to rival labels—and in fact ostin had received overtures from both the mgm and abc labels in  the wisdom of hymans investments was proved when kinney national company purchased warner brosseven arts for  million more than eight times what hyman had paid for warnerreprise and atlantic combined from the base of his familys funeral parlour business kinney president steve ross had rapidly built the kinney company into a profitable conglomerate with interests that included comic publishing the ashleyfamous talent agency parking lots and cleaning services following the takeover warners music group briefly adopted the umbrella name kinney music because us antitrust laws at the time prevented the three labels from trading as one ross was primarily focused on rebuilding the companys ailing movie division and was happy to defer to the advice of the managers of the companys record labels since he knew that they were generating most of the groups profits erteguns campaign against maitland began in earnest that summer atlantic had agreed to help warner bros in its efforts to establish its labels overseas beginning with its soontobeestablished warner bros subsidiary in australia but when warner executive phil rose arrived in australia he discovered that just one week earlier atlantic had signed a new fouryear distribution deal with a rival local label festival records owned by rupert murdochs news limited mike maitland complained bitterly to kinney executive ted ashley but to no avail – by this time ertegun was poised to make his move against maitland as he had with hyman ertegun urged steve ross to extend mo ostin and joe smiths contracts a recommendation ross was happy to accept ostin however had received overtures from other companies including mgm records and abc records and when he met with ertegun in january  and was offered maitlands job he was unwilling to resign immediately in response ertegun broadly hinted that maitlands days were numbered and that he ertegun was about to take over the recording division unlike the warnerreprise executives atlantics execs the ertegun brothers ahmet and neshui and wexler owned stock in kinney ostin was understandably concerned that if he accepted the position the warner bros staff would feel that he had stabbed maitland in the back but his attorney convinced him that maitlands departure was inevitable regardless of whether or not he accepted the post succinctly advising him dont be a schmuck on sunday january  ted ashley went to maitlands house to tell him he had been dismissed and maitland declined the offer of a job at the movie studio one week later mo ostin was named as the new president of warner bros records with joe smith as his executive vicepresident ertegun nominally remained the head of atlantic but since both ostin and smith owed their new positions to him ertegun was now the de facto head of the warner music division ertegun was given the formal title of executive vicepresidentmusic group maitland moved to mca records later that year and successfully consolidated mcas labels which he couldnt do at warner sedit during the s the kinney group built up a commanding position in the music industry in  kinney bought elektra records and its sister label nonesuch records founded by jac holzman in  for  million bringing in leading rock acts including the doors tim buckley and love and its historically significant folk archive along with the successful budget western classicalmusic label nonesuch records the purchase of elektranonesuch brought a rich back catalogue of folk music as well as the renowned nonesuch catalogue of classical and world music elektra founder jac holzman ran the label under warners for two years but by that time he was by his own admission burnt out after twenty years in the business kinney president steve ross subsequently appointed holzman as part of a sevenperson brains trust tasked with investigating opportunities presented by new technologies a role holzman was eager to accept the same year the group established its first overseas offices in canada and australia by that time the seven arts moniker was dropped from the warner bros name warner bros also founded the casablanca records subsidiary headed by neil bogart but several years later casablanca would become independent of warner bros worldwide distributionedit with the elektra acquisition the next step was forming an inhouse distribution arm for the coowned labels by this time warnerreprises frustrations with its current distributors had reached breaking point joe smith then executive vicepresident of warner bros recalled that the grateful dead were becoming a major act but the distributor was constantly out of stock of their albums these circumstances facilitated the full establishment of the groups inhouse distribution arm initially called kinney record group international by late  us antitrust laws had changed and the company was renamed warnerelektraatlantic wea for short which was renamed warner music in  the word group was added after the formation of aol time warner wea was an early champion of the heavy metal rock music several such bands including the three major pioneers led zeppelin black sabbath and deep purple were all signed to weas labels at least in the united states among the earliest american metal acts to be signed to wea were alice cooper montrose and van halen up to this point the kinneyowned record companies had relied on licensing deals with overseas record labels to manufacture distribute and promote its products in other countries concurrent with the establishment of its new distribution arm the company now began establishing subsidiaries in the other major markets beginning with the creation of warner bros records australia in  soon followed by branch offices in the uk europe and japan in july  the new inhouse distribution company was incorporated as warnerelektraatlantic distributing corp wea and branch offices were established in eight major us cities joel friedman a onetime billboard writer who had been the head of warners advertisingmerchandising division in its early years was appointed to head weas us domestic division and ahmet erteguns brother nesuhi was appointed to oversee its international operations neshui ertegun originally a turkish native like his brother displayed a global perspective and independence from its us counterpart by successfully promoting international acts in their target markets worldwide ertegun headed wea international until his retirement in  a de facto committee of three senior marketing executives—dave glew from atlantic ed rosenblatt from warner bros and mel posner from elektra—oversaw the integration of each labels marketing and distribution through the new division but each label continued to operate totally independently in ar matters and also applied their own expertise in marketing and advertising on july   following the pattern set by similar joint ventures in canada and australia the warner labels entered into a partnership with the british arm of cbs records to press and distribute warnerreprise product in the united kingdom although this was undertaken as a cooperative venture rather than a formally incorporated business partnership the billboard article that reported the new arrangement also noted that despite their intense competition in the us market cbs continued to press warnerreprise recordings in the usa however the new uk arrangement was a major blow to warners previous british manufacturer pye records for whom warnerreprise had been their largest account with the scheduled addition of the uk rights to the atlantic catalogue which would revert to kinney in early  billboard predicted that the warnercbs partnership would have a – share of the uk music market in april  thanks mainly to the influence of ahmet ertegun the kinney group announced a major coup with its acquisition of the worldwide rights to the rolling stones new label rolling stones records following the expiration of the bands contract with british decca then separate from the american label and the acrimonious end to their business relationship with their former manager allen klein under the terms of the deal atlantic subsidiary atco would distribute the stones recordings in the usa with other territories mainly handled by warner bros international divisions one of kinneys wisest investments was fleetwood mac the band signed to reprise in the early s after relocating to the usa and the label supported them through numerous lineup changes and several lean years during which the bands records sold relatively poorly although they remained a popular concert attraction ironically after their transfer to warner bros in  and the recruitment of new members lindsay buckingham and stevie nicks the group scored a major international hit with the single rhiannon and consolidated with the best selling albums fleetwood mac rumours and tusk warner communicationsedit due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations kinney national spun off its nonentertainment assets in  as national kinney corporation and changed its name to warner communications inc in  the warner group acquired another rich prize david geffens asylum records the  million purchase brought in several acts who would prove crucial the warner groups subsequent success including linda ronstadt the eagles jackson browne joni mitchell and later warren zevon on the downside however it was rumored that warners was soon concerned about their possible liability under the california state labor code because of geffens questionable status as both the manager of most of the asylum acts and the head of the record label to which they were signed the sale included the asylum records label and its recordings as well as geffens lucrative music publishing assets and the interests in the royalties of some of the artists managed by geffen and partner elliot roberts geffen accepted a fiveyear contract with wci and turned over his  share in the geffenroberts management company to roberts and warners paid geffen and roberts  common shares worth  at the time of the sale plus  in cash and a further  million in promissory notes convertible to common stock although it seemed a lucrative deal at the time geffen soon had reason to regret it uncharacteristically he had greatly underestimated the value of his assets—within asylums first year as a warner subsidiary albums by linda ronstadt and the eagles alone had earned more than the entire value of the asylum sale geffens discomfort was compounded by the fact that within six months of the sale the value of his volatile warner shares had plummeted from  million to just  he appealed to steve ross to intervene and as part of a makegood deal ross agreed to pay him the difference in the share value over five years acting on jac holzmans suggestion that kinney should take asylum from atlantic and merge it with elektra ross then appointed geffen to run the new combined label in  warner gained a brief early lead in digital media when it purchased the atari computer company and in  it bought the franklin mint company wci also blazed the trail in visual music with mtv which it created

warnerelektraatlantic formed pacific records for their composers and distributed appropriately by atlantic records alan oday was the first artist signed to the label and the first release was undercover angel the song which he described as a nocturnal novelette was in february  within a few months it had become  in the country and has sold approximately two million copies it was also a hit in australia reaching  on the australian singles chart undercover angel also landed oday in an exclusive club as one of only a handful of writersperformers to pen a  hit for themselves and a  for another artist new signings in the late s placed wea in a strong position for the s a deal with seymour steins sire records label which warner bros records later took over brought in several major punk rock and new wave acts including the pretenders the ramones and talking heads and most importantly rising star madonna elektra signed the cars and warner bros signed prince giving wea several of the biggestselling acts of the decade weas labels also distributed a number of otherwise independent labels for example warner bros distributed straight records discreet records bizarre records bearsville records and geffen records the latter was sold to mca in  atlantic records distributed swan song records in  wea scored a major coup by signing a distribution agreement with island records which only covered the united states and select other countries for the next  years initially with warner bros until  then with atlantic afterward wea would distribute such artists as bob marley u robert palmer anthrax and tom waits this relationship ended when island was sold to polygram in  sedit a proposed  international merger between polygram and wea was forbidden by both the us federal trade commission and west germanys cartel office so polygrams halfowner philips then purchased a further  of the company from its partner siemens and bought the remaining shares in  the same year polygram divested its film and publishing operations closed polygram pictures and sold chappell music to warner for us million wea signed with mca records a distribution agreement of this discographic house outside us in  which lasted until  wea formed wea manufacturing in  in  wea took over the german classical label teldec and the british magnet label in  it was announced that warner

records japan in  sedit through the s time warner was the largest media company in the world with assets in excess of us billion and annual revenues in the billions of dollars by  warners music labels were generating sales valued at more than us billion with operating profits of  million and by  its music division dominated the us music industry with a  share of the domestic market acquisitions and corporate changes within the warner group of labels continued after the time warner merger—in  wea purchased french label carrere records wea was renamed warner music group in  leading french classical label erato  and in  wea bought the spanish dro records hungarys magneoton label the swedish telegram records brazils continental records and finnish label fazer musiiki also miguel tomas lucio was signed to the label atlantic launched two new subsidiary labels in the early s east west records and interscope records in  east west absorbed atco records and was eventually folded into elektra records in  interscope was purchased by mca music entertainment during  the warner music group faced one of the most serious publicrelations crises in its history when a major controversy erupted over the provocative warner bros recording cop killer from the selftitled album by body count a heavy metalrap fusion band led by icet unfortunately for warner the song which mentioned the rodney king case was issued just before the controversial acquittal of the police charged with kings beating which sparked the  los angeles riots and the confluence of events put the song under the national spotlight complaints escalated over the summer—conservative police associations called for a boycott of time warner products politicians including president george h w bush denounced the label for releasing the song warner executives received death threats time warner stockholders threatened to pull out of the company and the new zealand police commissioner unsuccessfully tried to have the record banned there although icet later voluntarily reissued body count without cop killer the furor seriously rattled warner music and in january  the label made an undisclosed deal releasing icet from his contract and returning the body count master tapes to him also in  the rhino records label signed a distribution agreement with atlantic records and time warner bought a  stake in the rhino records label the distribution agreement allowed rhino to begin reissuing recordings from atlantics back catalogue in  canadian beverage giant seagram bought a  stake in time warner and the warner publishing division—now called warnerchappell music – acquired cppbelwin becoming the worlds largest owner of song copyrights and the worlds largest publisher of printed music in  time warner made another dramatic expansion of its media holdings taking over the turner broadcasting system which by then included the turner cable tv network cnn and the screen production houses castle rock entertainment and new line cinema acquisitions that would bring huge profits into the warner group thanks to content assets like seinfeld and the highly successful the lord of the rings film trilogy by the early s senior warner staff like ostin and waronker had remained in their positions for several decades—a highly unusual situation in the american music industry—but the death of steve ross destabilized the time warner hierarchy and over the next few years the music group was increasingly disrupted by internal power struggles leading to a string of major executive upheavals in – which the new york times described as a virtual civil war the central conflict was between mo ostin and warner music group chairman robert morgado who had joined the warner group in the late s because of his political background he had been the chiefofstaff to former new york governor hugh l carey and his lack of music industry experience—especially compared to the widely revered ostin—morgado was viewed as an outsider at warner nevertheless he gained favour with ross and levin and was promoted in  to oversee the warner international music division after helping the company slash costs in its computer game sector since his appointment as head of wbr ostin had always reported directly to steve ross and rosss successor gerald levin but in late  when ostins contract came up for renewal morgado asserted his authority insisting that ostin should now report directly to him the tensions between them reached boiling point in july  when morgado appointed former atlantic chief doug morris to head the warner music group in the usa a decision that many saw as a deliberate move to hasten the departure of ostin and elektra head robert krasnow morgados new structure was announced in august  and bob krasnow resigned from elektra the next day within days after more than  years with the warner music group and more than  years as president and chairman of warner bros records ostin announced he would not renew his current contract and would leave warners when it expired on december   there was more negative publicity the following month when leading elektra act metallica launched a lawsuit against the label seeking a release from their contract and ownership of their master tapes and claiming that morgado had refused to honour a deal they had worked out with krasnow before he quit ostins departure marked a seismic shift in the corporate culture at wbr and the news was greeted with dismay by industry insiders and the many artists whose careers he had helped to nurture lenny waronker had agreed to take over as wbr chairman and ceo but in october  he announced that he would not be taking up the position he initially said that he would remain as president of wbr but by this time there was already widespread speculation that he would leave and he did so soon afterwards the following year he rejoined ostin and son michael as joint head of the newly launched dreamworks label beginning in august  morgado alienated morris by his clumsy handling of warners relationship with interscope records the successful label founded by ted field and jimmy iovine and partowned by warner morgado had resisted making a decision about increasing the warner stake in interscope which encouraged other companies to make overtures to the label in response morgado threatened to send ceaseanddesist notices to executives at several record companies demanding that they stop approaching interscope with buyout offers a move that reportedly infuriated iovine by late  morris was gaining the upper hand over his rival and media reports claimed that morris had moved to settle with metallica offering a deal that was reportedly even more generous than the one they had worked out with krasnow morgado now faced a showdown with morris who felt he was not being allowed to run wmg as he saw fit in october  morris and  other warner executives staged an unprecedented insurrection that nearly paralyzed the worlds largest record company this led to a climactic meeting between morris and gerald levin in late october at which morris reportedly threatened to quit if he had to continue to report to morgado morgado gave in to the demand that morris be granted autonomy to run the north american operations and he was forced to upgrade morriss position from chief operating officer to chief executive of warner music group usa morris promptly named danny goldberg former president of atlantic records to run wbr in defiance of morgado who had a different candidate in mind and levin also reduced morgados power to oversee warners mailorder record club division and its international operations morris then brought in sylvia rhone and seymour stein to stabilize elektra settled the metallica lawsuit and persuaded levin to purchase an additional  of interscope although this initiative proved shortlived the power struggle between morgado and morris reached a dramatic climax in may  when morgado was asked to resign by gerald levin following a welter of complaints from executives at the three major warner music labels who said that morgado was undermining morriss authority and damaging warners reputation among performers morgado was immediately replaced by hbo chairman michael j fuchs but the corporate upheavals did not end there in late june  fuchs abruptly dismissed doug morris saying that morris had been leading a campaign to destabilize warner music in an effort to seize control of the company as morriss strongest ally danny goldberg was also under threat he was initially told that he could stay on as president of wbr as long as he refrained from office politics and concentrate on the daytoday management of the label but he resigned as president of warner bros records soon after to pursue other interests and was replaced by wbr vicechairman russ thyret despite early success with dr dre and snoop dogg and morriss decision to increase warners stake to  by the mids interscope records was being seen as a liability for the warner group time warners board and investors had already been bruised by the damaging  cop killer controversy and now they were faced with renewed criticism about the gangsta rap genre in which interscopes associate imprint death row records was a key label in mid time warner refused to distribute the interscope album dogg food by tha dogg pound forcing the label to seek outside distribution and late in the year tw sold its stake in death row back to coowners jimmy iovine and ted field and soon after it sold off its share in interscope to mca music entertainment the upheaval at warner was beneficial to its rivals who picked up valuable executives who had left warner goldberg moved over to mercury records morris joined mca music entertainment group and led its reorganization into universal music group now the worlds largest record company in november  fuchs was himself sacked by levin leaving the company with a reported us million golden parachute and time warner cochairmen robert a daly and terry semel took over the running of the music division in  seagram boss edgar bronfman jr held talks aimed at merging seagrams universal music headed by morris with the venerable british recording company emi but the discussions came to nothing bronfman then oversaw universals takeover by vivendi wea meanwhile continued to expand its publishing empire buying a  stake in the italian recording and music publishing group nuova fonit cetra also in  time warner bought the remaining  of the rhino records label they did not own the rhino records retail store in los angeles was not included rhino then began reissuing the back catalogues of the warnerreprise and elektraasylum labels in  rhino launched rhino handmade which released limitededition reissues of lesserknown but stillsignificant recordings from the wea labels sedit in  time warner merged with leading american internet service provider aol to create aol time warner the new conglomerate again tried and failed to acquire emi and subsequent discussions about the takeover of bmg stalled with bertelsmann eventually offloading bmg into a joint venture with sony in  aoltw further consolidated its hold over the publishing industry buying  of music publisher deston songs from edel ag by the early s however the effects of the dotcom crash had eroded aols profits and stock value and in  the time warner board sidelined its underperforming partner by dropping aol from its business name looking to reduce its debt load time warner—the corporate successor to warner communications—sold warner music group in  to a group of investors led by edgar bronfman jr for us billion this spinoff was completed on february   in the  transition to independent ownership wmg hired record industry heavyweight lyor cohen from universal music group the result of the merger between the polygram and mca label families to attempt to reduce cost and increase performance contrary to common belief time warner no longer retains any ownership in wmg though it had the option to reacquire up to  of wmg for three years following the closing of the transaction wmgs current logo is the former warner communications logo originally designed by saul bass and is used under license by its former parent which retains full ownership and control of the warner trademarks once free of time warner wmg began cutting costs by offloading lossmaking or lowearning divisions like its rival emi warner reacted to the growth of the digital music market by making a historic change moving out of record production by closing or selling off discpressing plants particularly in territories such as the usa and the netherlands where production costs are high the us manufacturing operations were sold to cinram in  before the purchase from time warner in  the miamibased warner bros publications which printed and distributed a broad selection of

records which was a division of rival paramount pictures in order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies and to also capitalize on the music business warner bros records was created in  warner purchased reprise records which had been founded by frank sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings with the reprise acquisition warner gained the services of mo ostin who would be mainly responsible for the success of warnerreprise the canadian unit was opened in  as warner reprise canada ltd now called warner music canada co after warner bros was sold to seven arts productions in  forming warner brosseven arts it purchased atlantic records founded in  and wmgs oldest label until wmg completed its acquisition of parlophone in  as well as its subsidiary atco records this acquisition brought neil young into the company fold initially as a member of buffalo springfield young would become one of warners longestestablished artists recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the warnerowned atlantic atco and reprise labels as well as making five albums for geffen records during that labels period of warner distribution the geffen catalogue now owned by universal music group represents youngs only major recordings not under wmg ownership in  two years after being purchased by seven arts the warner brosseven arts company was sold to the kinney national company kinney later changing its name to warner communications combined the operations of all of its record labels and kinney ceo steve ross led the group through its most successful period until his death in  an earlier attempt by warner bros records to create an inhouse distribution arm in  didnt materialize so in  elektra records boss jac holzman approached atlantics jerry wexler with the idea of setting up a joint distribution network for warner elektra and atlantic an experimental branch was established in southern california as a possible prototype for an expanded operation atlantic its subsidiary atco records and its affiliate stax records paved the way for warners rise to industry prominence the purchase brought in atlantics lucrative backcatalogue which included classic recordings by ray charles the drifters the coasters and many more in the mid s atlanticstax had released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including booker t  the mgs sam  dave wilson pickett otis redding ben e king and aretha franklin but the sale led to stax leaving the atlantic fold because the new warner owners insisted on keeping the rights to stax recordings however atlantic also moved decisively into rock and pop in the late s and s signing major british and american acts including led zeppelin cream crosby stills  nash yes emerson lake  palmer average white band dr john king crimson bette midler roxy music and foreigner atlantic exerts autonomyedit it was soon apparent in  that atlanticatco president ahmet ertegün viewed warnerreprise president mike maitland as a rival maitland believed that as vicepresident in charge of the warner brosseven arts music division he should have final say over all recording operations and he further angered ertegün by proposing that most of atlantics backoffice functions such as marketing and distribution be combined with the existing departments at warnerreprise in retrospect ertegün clearly feared that maitland would ultimately have more power than him and so he moved rapidly to secure his own position and remove maitland maitland had put off renegotiating the contracts of joe smith and mo ostin the presidents of the warner bros and reprise labels and this provided ertegün with an effective means of undermining maitland when wexler—now a major shareholder—found out about the contract issue he and ertegün began pressuring eliot hyman to get smith and ostin under contract ostensibly because they were worried that the two executives might move to rival labels—and in fact ostin had received overtures from both the mgm and abc labels in  the wisdom of hymans investments was proved when kinney national company purchased warner brosseven arts for  million more than eight times what hyman had paid for warnerreprise and atlantic combined from the base of his familys funeral parlour business kinney president steve ross had rapidly built the kinney company into a profitable conglomerate with interests that included comic publishing the ashleyfamous talent agency parking lots and cleaning services following the takeover warners music group briefly adopted the umbrella name kinney music because us antitrust laws at the time prevented the three labels from trading as one ross was primarily focused on rebuilding the companys ailing movie division and was happy to defer to the advice of the managers of the companys record labels since he knew that they were generating most of the groups profits erteguns campaign against maitland began in earnest that summer atlantic had agreed to help warner bros in its efforts to establish its labels overseas beginning with its soontobeestablished warner bros subsidiary in australia but when warner executive phil rose arrived in australia he discovered that just one week earlier atlantic had signed a new fouryear distribution deal with a rival local label festival records owned by rupert murdochs news limited mike maitland complained bitterly to kinney executive ted ashley but to no avail – by this time ertegun was poised to make his move against maitland as he had with hyman ertegun urged steve ross to extend mo ostin and joe smiths contracts a recommendation ross was happy to accept ostin however had received overtures from other companies including mgm records and abc records and when he met with ertegun in january  and was offered maitlands job he was unwilling to resign immediately in response ertegun broadly hinted that maitlands days were numbered and that he ertegun was about to take over the recording division unlike the warnerreprise executives atlantics execs the ertegun brothers ahmet and neshui and wexler owned stock in kinney ostin was understandably concerned that if he accepted the position the warner bros staff would feel that he had stabbed maitland in the back but his attorney convinced him that maitlands departure was inevitable regardless of whether or not he accepted the post succinctly advising him dont be a schmuck on sunday january  ted ashley went to maitlands house to tell him he had been dismissed and maitland declined the offer of a job at the movie studio one week later mo ostin was named as the new president of warner bros records with joe smith as his executive vicepresident ertegun nominally remained the head of atlantic but since both ostin and smith owed their new positions to him ertegun was now the de facto head of the warner music division ertegun was given the formal title of executive vicepresidentmusic group maitland moved to mca records later that year and successfully consolidated mcas labels which he couldnt do at warner sedit during the s the kinney group built up a commanding position in the music industry in  kinney bought elektra records and its sister label nonesuch records founded by jac holzman in  for  million bringing in leading rock acts including the doors tim buckley and love and its historically significant folk archive along with the successful budget western classicalmusic label nonesuch records the purchase of elektranonesuch brought a rich back catalogue of folk music as well as the renowned nonesuch catalogue of classical and world music elektra founder jac holzman ran the label under warners for two years but by that time he was by his own admission burnt out after twenty years in the business kinney president steve ross subsequently appointed holzman as part of a sevenperson brains trust tasked with investigating opportunities presented by new technologies a role holzman was eager to accept the same year the group established its first overseas offices in canada and australia by that time the seven arts moniker was dropped from the warner bros name warner bros also founded the casablanca records subsidiary headed by neil bogart but several years later casablanca would become independent of warner bros worldwide distributionedit with the elektra acquisition the next step was forming an inhouse distribution arm for the coowned labels by this time warnerreprises frustrations with its current distributors had reached breaking point joe smith then executive vicepresident of warner bros recalled that the grateful dead were becoming a major act but the distributor was constantly out of stock of their albums these circumstances facilitated the full establishment of the groups inhouse distribution arm initially called kinney record group international by late  us antitrust laws had changed and the company was renamed warnerelektraatlantic wea for short which was renamed warner music in  the word group was added after the formation of aol time warner wea was an early champion of the heavy metal rock music several such bands including the three major pioneers led zeppelin black sabbath and deep purple were all signed to weas labels at least in the united states among the earliest american metal acts to be signed to wea were alice cooper montrose and van halen up to this point the kinneyowned record companies had relied on licensing deals with overseas record labels to manufacture distribute and promote its products in other countries concurrent with the establishment of its new distribution arm the company now began establishing subsidiaries in the other major markets beginning with the creation of warner bros records australia in  soon followed by branch offices in the uk europe and japan in july  the new inhouse distribution company was incorporated as warnerelektraatlantic distributing corp wea and branch offices were established in eight major us cities joel friedman a onetime billboard writer who had been the head of warners advertisingmerchandising division in its early years was appointed to head weas us domestic division and ahmet erteguns brother nesuhi was appointed to oversee its international operations neshui ertegun originally a turkish native like his brother displayed a global perspective and independence from its us counterpart by successfully promoting international acts in their target markets worldwide ertegun headed wea international until his retirement in  a de facto committee of three senior marketing executives—dave glew from atlantic ed rosenblatt from warner bros and mel posner from elektra—oversaw the integration of each labels marketing and distribution through the new division but each label continued to operate totally independently in ar matters and also applied their own expertise in marketing and advertising on july   following the pattern set by similar joint ventures in canada and australia the warner labels entered into a partnership with the british arm of cbs records to press and distribute warnerreprise product in the united kingdom although this was undertaken as a cooperative venture rather than a formally incorporated business partnership the billboard article that reported the new arrangement also noted that despite their intense competition in the us market cbs continued to press warnerreprise recordings in the usa however the new uk arrangement was a major blow to warners previous british manufacturer pye records for whom warnerreprise had been their largest account with the scheduled addition of the uk rights to the atlantic catalogue which would revert to kinney in early  billboard predicted that the warnercbs partnership would have a – share of the uk music market in april  thanks mainly to the influence of ahmet ertegun the kinney group announced a major coup with its acquisition of the worldwide rights to the rolling stones new label rolling stones records following the expiration of the bands contract with british decca then separate from the american label and the acrimonious end to their business relationship with their former manager allen klein under the terms of the deal atlantic subsidiary atco would distribute the stones recordings in the usa with other territories mainly handled by warner bros international divisions one of kinneys wisest investments was fleetwood mac the band signed to reprise in the early s after relocating to the usa and the label supported them through numerous lineup changes and several lean years during which the bands records sold relatively poorly although they remained a popular concert attraction ironically after their transfer to warner bros in  and the recruitment of new members lindsay buckingham and stevie nicks the group scored a major international hit with the single rhiannon and consolidated with the best selling albums fleetwood mac rumours and tusk warner communicationsedit due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations kinney national spun off its nonentertainment assets in  as national kinney corporation and changed its name to warner communications inc in  the warner group acquired another rich prize david geffens asylum records the  million purchase brought in several acts who would prove crucial the warner groups subsequent success including linda ronstadt the eagles jackson browne joni mitchell and later warren zevon on the downside however it was rumored that warners was soon concerned about their possible liability under the california state labor code because of geffens questionable status as both the manager of most of the asylum acts and the head of the record label to which they were signed the sale included the asylum records label and its recordings as well as geffens lucrative music publishing assets and the interests in the royalties of some of the artists managed by geffen and partner elliot roberts geffen accepted a fiveyear contract with wci and turned over his  share in the geffenroberts management company to roberts and warners paid geffen and roberts  common shares worth  at the time of the sale plus  in cash and a further  million in promissory notes convertible to common stock although it seemed a lucrative deal at the time geffen soon had reason to regret it uncharacteristically he had greatly underestimated the value of his assets—within asylums first year as a warner subsidiary albums by linda ronstadt and the eagles alone had earned more than the entire value of the asylum sale geffens discomfort was compounded by the fact that within six months of the sale the value of his volatile warner shares had plummeted from  million to just  he appealed to steve ross to intervene and as part of a makegood deal ross agreed to pay him the difference in the share value over five years acting on jac holzmans suggestion that kinney should take asylum from atlantic and merge it with elektra ross then appointed geffen to run the new combined label in  warner gained a brief early lead in digital media when it purchased the atari computer company and in  it bought the franklin mint company wci also blazed the trail in visual music with mtv which it created and coowned in partnership with american express in – warner rapidly divested many of these recent acquisitions including atari franklin mint panavision mtv networks and a cosmetics business in  warnerelektraatlantic formed pacific records for their composers and distributed appropriately by atlantic records alan oday was the first artist signed to the label and the first release was undercover angel the song which he described as a nocturnal novelette was in february  within a few months it had become  in the country and has sold approximately two million copies it was also a hit in australia reaching  on the australian singles chart undercover angel also landed oday in an exclusive club as one of only a handful of writersperformers to pen a  hit for themselves and a  for another artist new signings in the late s placed wea in a strong position for the s a deal with seymour steins sire records label which warner bros records later took over brought in several major punk rock and new wave acts including the pretenders the ramones and talking heads and most importantly rising star madonna elektra signed the cars and warner bros signed prince giving wea several of the biggestselling acts of the decade weas labels also distributed a number of otherwise independent labels for example warner bros distributed straight records discreet records bizarre records bearsville records and geffen records the latter was sold to mca in  atlantic records distributed swan song records in  wea scored a major coup by signing a distribution agreement with island records which only covered the united states and select other countries for the next  years initially with warner bros until  then with atlantic afterward wea would distribute such artists as bob marley u robert palmer anthrax and tom waits this relationship ended when island was sold to polygram in  sedit a proposed  international merger between polygram and wea was forbidden by both the us federal trade commission and west germanys cartel office so polygrams halfowner philips then purchased a further  of the company from its partner siemens and bought the remaining shares in  the same year polygram divested its film and publishing operations closed polygram pictures and sold chappell music to warner for us million wea signed with mca records a distribution agreement of this discographic house outside us in  which lasted until  wea formed wea manufacturing in  in  wea took over the german classical label teldec and the british magnet label in  it was announced that warner communications was to merge with time inc to form time warner a transaction that was completed in  following the merger wea continued acquiring independent labels buying cgd records italy and mmg records japan in  sedit through the s time warner was the largest media company in the world with assets in excess of us billion and annual revenues in the billions of dollars by  warners music labels were generating sales valued at more than us billion with operating profits of  million and by  its music division dominated the us music industry with a  share of the domestic market acquisitions and corporate changes within the warner group of labels continued after the time warner merger—in  wea purchased french label carrere records wea was renamed warner music group in  leading french classical label erato  and in  wea bought the spanish dro records hungarys magneoton label the swedish telegram records brazils continental records and finnish label fazer musiiki also miguel tomas lucio was signed to the label atlantic launched two new subsidiary labels in the early s east west records and interscope records in  east west absorbed atco records and was eventually folded into elektra records in  interscope was purchased by mca music entertainment during  the warner music group faced one of the most serious publicrelations crises in its history when a major controversy erupted over the provocative warner bros recording cop killer from the selftitled album by body count a heavy metalrap fusion band led by icet unfortunately for warner the song which mentioned the rodney king case was issued just before the controversial acquittal of the police charged with kings beating which sparked the  los angeles riots and the confluence of events put the song under the national spotlight complaints escalated over the summer—conservative police associations called for a boycott of time warner products politicians including president george h w bush denounced the label for releasing the song warner executives received death threats time warner stockholders threatened to pull out of the company and the new zealand police commissioner unsuccessfully tried to have the record banned there although icet later voluntarily reissued body count without cop killer the furor seriously rattled warner music and in january  the label made an undisclosed deal releasing icet from his contract and returning the body count master tapes to him also in  the rhino records label signed a distribution agreement with atlantic records and time warner bought a  stake in the rhino records label the distribution agreement allowed rhino to begin reissuing recordings from atlantics back catalogue in  canadian beverage giant seagram bought a  stake in time warner and the warner publishing division—now called warnerchappell music – acquired cppbelwin becoming the worlds largest owner of song copyrights and the worlds largest publisher of printed music in  time warner made another dramatic expansion of its media holdings taking over the turner broadcasting system which by then included the turner cable tv network cnn and the screen production houses castle rock entertainment and new line cinema acquisitions that would bring huge profits into the warner group thanks to content assets like seinfeld and the highly successful the lord of the rings film trilogy by the early s senior warner staff like ostin and waronker had remained in their positions for several decades—a highly unusual situation in the american music industry—but the death of steve ross destabilized the time warner hierarchy and over the next few years the music group was increasingly disrupted by internal power struggles leading to a string of major executive upheavals in – which the new york times described as a virtual civil war the central conflict was between mo ostin and warner music group chairman robert morgado who had joined the warner group in the late s because of his political background he had been the chiefofstaff to former new york governor hugh l carey and his lack of music industry experience—especially compared to the widely revered ostin—morgado was viewed as an outsider at warner nevertheless he gained favour with ross and levin and was promoted in  to oversee the warner international music division after helping the company slash costs in its computer game sector since his appointment as head of wbr ostin had always reported directly to steve ross and rosss successor gerald levin but in late  when ostins contract came up for renewal morgado asserted his authority insisting that ostin should now report directly to him the tensions between them reached boiling point in july  when morgado appointed former atlantic chief doug morris to head the warner music group in the usa a decision that many saw as a deliberate move to hasten the departure of ostin and elektra head robert krasnow morgados new structure was announced in august  and bob krasnow resigned from elektra the next day within days after more than  years with the warner music group and more than  years as president and chairman of warner bros records ostin announced he would not renew his current contract and would leave warners when it expired on december   there was more negative publicity the following month when leading elektra act metallica launched a lawsuit against the label seeking a release from their contract and ownership of their master tapes and claiming that morgado had refused to honour a deal they had worked out with krasnow before he quit ostins departure marked a seismic shift in the corporate culture at wbr and the news was greeted with dismay by industry insiders and the many artists whose careers he had helped to nurture lenny waronker had agreed to take over as wbr chairman and ceo but in october  he announced that he would not be taking up the position he initially said that he would remain as president of wbr but by this time there was already widespread speculation that he would leave and he did so soon afterwards the following year he rejoined ostin and son michael as joint head of the newly launched dreamworks label beginning in august  morgado alienated morris by his clumsy handling of warners relationship with interscope records the successful label founded by ted field and jimmy iovine and partowned by warner morgado had resisted making a decision about increasing the warner stake in interscope which encouraged other companies to make overtures to the label in response morgado threatened to send ceaseanddesist notices to executives at several record companies demanding that they stop approaching interscope with buyout offers a move that reportedly infuriated iovine by late  morris was gaining the upper hand over his rival and media reports claimed that morris had moved to settle with metallica offering a deal that was reportedly even more generous than the one they had worked out with krasnow morgado now faced a showdown with morris who felt he was not being allowed to run wmg as he saw fit in october  morris and  other warner executives staged an unprecedented insurrection that nearly paralyzed the worlds largest record company this led to a climactic meeting between morris and gerald levin in late october at which morris reportedly threatened to quit if he had to continue to report to morgado morgado gave in to the demand that morris be granted autonomy to run the north american operations and he was forced to upgrade morriss position from chief operating officer to chief executive of warner music group usa morris promptly named danny goldberg former president of atlantic records to run wbr in defiance of morgado who had a different candidate in mind and levin also reduced morgados power to oversee warners mailorder record club division and its international operations morris then brought in sylvia rhone and seymour stein to stabilize elektra settled the metallica lawsuit and persuaded levin to purchase an additional  of interscope although this initiative proved shortlived the power struggle between morgado and morris reached a dramatic climax in may  when morgado was asked to resign by gerald levin following a welter of complaints from executives at the three major warner music labels who said that morgado was undermining morriss authority and damaging warners reputation among performers morgado was immediately replaced by hbo chairman michael j fuchs but the corporate upheavals did not end there in late june  fuchs abruptly dismissed doug morris saying that morris had been leading a campaign to destabilize warner music in an effort to seize control of the company as morriss strongest ally danny goldberg was also under threat he was initially told that he could stay on as president of wbr as long as he refrained from office politics and concentrate on the daytoday management of the label but he resigned as president of warner bros records soon after to pursue other interests and was replaced by wbr vicechairman russ thyret despite early success with dr dre and snoop dogg and morriss decision to increase warners stake to  by the mids interscope records was being seen as a liability for the warner group time warners board and investors had already been bruised by the damaging  cop killer controversy and now they were faced with renewed criticism about the gangsta rap genre in which interscopes associate imprint death row records was a key label in mid time warner refused to distribute the interscope album dogg food by tha dogg pound forcing the label to seek outside distribution and late in the year tw sold its stake in death row back to coowners jimmy iovine and ted field and soon after it sold off its share in interscope to mca music entertainment the upheaval at warner was beneficial to its rivals who picked up valuable executives who had left warner goldberg moved over to mercury records morris joined mca music entertainment group and led its reorganization into universal music group now the worlds largest record company in november  fuchs was himself sacked by levin leaving the company with a reported us million golden parachute and time warner cochairmen robert a daly and terry semel took over the running of the music division in  seagram boss edgar bronfman jr held talks aimed at merging seagrams universal music headed by morris with the venerable british recording company emi but the discussions came to nothing bronfman then oversaw universals takeover by vivendi wea meanwhile continued to expand its publishing empire buying a  stake in the italian recording and music publishing group nuova fonit cetra also in  time warner bought the remaining  of the rhino records label they did not own the rhino records retail store in los angeles was not included rhino then began reissuing the back catalogues of the warnerreprise and elektraasylum labels in  rhino launched rhino handmade which released limitededition reissues of lesserknown but stillsignificant recordings from the wea labels sedit in  time warner merged with leading american internet service provider aol to create aol time warner the new conglomerate again tried and failed to acquire emi and subsequent discussions about the takeover of bmg stalled with bertelsmann eventually offloading bmg into a joint venture with sony in  aoltw further consolidated its hold over the publishing industry buying  of music publisher deston songs from edel ag by the early s however the effects of the dotcom crash had eroded aols profits and stock value and in  the time warner board sidelined its underperforming partner by dropping aol from its business name looking to reduce its debt load time warner—the corporate successor to warner communications—sold warner music group in  to a group of investors led by edgar bronfman jr for us billion this spinoff was completed on february   in the  transition to independent ownership wmg hired record industry heavyweight lyor cohen from universal music group the result of the merger between the polygram and mca label families to attempt to reduce cost and increase performance contrary to common belief time warner no longer retains any ownership in wmg though it had the option to reacquire up to  of wmg for three years following the closing of the transaction wmgs current logo is the former warner communications logo originally designed by saul bass and is used under license by its former parent which retains full ownership and control of the warner trademarks once free of time warner wmg began cutting costs by offloading lossmaking or lowearning divisions like its rival emi warner reacted to the growth of the digital music market by making a historic change moving out of record production by closing or selling off discpressing plants particularly in territories such as the usa and the netherlands where production costs are high the us manufacturing operations were sold to cinram in  before the purchase from time warner in  the miamibased warner bros publications which printed and distributed a broad selection of sheet music books educational material orchestrations arrangements and tutorials was sold to alfred music publishing although the sale excluded the print music business of wmgs word music church hymnals choral music and associated instrumental music on may   wmg apparently rejected a buyout offer from emi then wmg offered to buy emi and it also rejected the offer in august  emi was purchased by terra firma capital partners talk of a possible wmg acquisition of emi was fanned once again in  after wmg executed a bond offering for  billion which brought to light wmgs relatively strong financial position which was contrasted with the weakened and debtladen state of emi the same year wmg acquired rykodisc and roadrunner records on december   warner announced that it would sell digital music without digital rights management through amazonmp making it the third major label to do so in  the new york times reported that wmgs atlantic records became the first major record label

together with the orchard licensed their full back catalogs to the new concept of spotify in order to fight piracy with a legal way of music streaming however in february  wmg announced that it would no longer be licensing music for spotify and other free streaming services claiming that they were clearly not positive for the industry in  warner music took over its southeast asian and korean
