they entered their fathers firm gained experience at whiteheads topmaking and spinning business and acquired an outstanding technical knowledge of wool like their father they were to profit by setting up testing plants in woolselling centres to estimate the clean value of the product about  james established a branch of j w mcgregor  co in sydney concentrating on the markets there and in brisbane his technical and trading skills enhanced by contacts with whiteheads and other overseas buyers soon made him wealthy on  december  he was appointed wool appraiser for the new south wales committee

presbyterian church sydney on  august  he married alice constance taylor a stenographer they were to remain childless with harold he set up companies in the channel islands to control the firms substantial topmaking interests in europe though they held their australian interests separately after their fathers death in  james centred his business on his wellknown office in bond street sydney and travelled abroad regularly renowned for his expertise he again played a leading role including framing the table of limits in the central wool committee which was reestablished in september  to control wartime wool disposal its chairman praised him in  for his almost superhuman efforts in peacetime mcgregor traded extensively expanding his activities and offices during the korean war wool

australian english and french artists friendly with sir william ashton sir lionel lindsay sir daryl lindsay and adrian feint he extended patronage to several artists and donated works to galleries in

the church of scotland harolds business flair and attention to detail together with rising wool prices enabled him to do well his skill in judging wool led to his appointment as controlling appraiser

most significant being balquhidder in south australia and glenalpine and toonambool in victoria he also held interests in real estate in adelaide and other businesses like james he played a leading role in the australian council of woolbuyers and was a discerning collector of art but in temperament he was more reticent and no bon vivant respecting the scottish traits of quiet service and private giving and having often needed hospital accommodation himself when beds were short harold took up the cause of adelaides st andrews hospital a private institution associated with the presbyterian church he organized a family donation of £ to its building fund in  and gave large sums of money himself he harried a reluctant government to help advising it that he was somewhat weary of digging deep into my own pocket and pressing my family and friends to give and he guaranteed personally and anonymously the hospitals large mortgage for its new building in  as board chairman  he worked tirelessly for the expanding hospital as it assumed a large training role for many years he was an elder of adelaides scots church to which he and james gave an outstanding set of stainedglass windows by lawrence lee in memory of their parents as a young man harold had been a competent yachtsman ill health dogged his final years survived by his wife son and two daughters he died on  january  at st
