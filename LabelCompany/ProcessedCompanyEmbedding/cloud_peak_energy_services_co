early actions of the trump administration and congress have brought some welcome regulatory relief for the industry the overturning of the stream protection rule using the congressional review act and the recent executive orders that directed a review of the waters of the us rule and the clean power plan the lifting of the federal coalleasing moratorium and halting of the associated programmatic environmental impact statement will help us coal producers the suspension and reevaluation of the  federal coal valuation rule is also a positive change for the company’s export logistics business as the department of the interior reverts to the previous longstanding methodology during this reevaluation and removes the complexity and uncertainty that the new rule would have introduced these actions are important and welcome serving to add predictability and eliminate new and unnecessary costs for mining operations looking forward the company is optimistic that congress and the current administration will support the development and commercialization of advanced coal technology as well as establish a regulatory framework that gives utilities the confidence to invest in the nation’s critical coal power plant fleet which provides safe reliable and affordable electricity across the us domestic outlook mine shipments to domestic customers for the first quarter were  million tons in line with customer schedules and reflecting the usual seasonal suspension of shipments on the great lakes with natural gas prices around  per mmbtu utilities have maintained their consumption levels of prb coal and are taking their contracted coal the latest data from the us energy information administration “eia” shows that natural gas inventories have declined by  bcf or  percent due to winter heating demand and reduced production compared to  levels energy ventures analysis “eva” estimates that prb coal inventories at utilities were  million tons as of the end of the first quarter of  a decline of  million tons from first quarter  levels unfortunately the very mild winter prevented prb stockpiles from declining further resulting in continued elevated levels full year shipments will largely depend on the level of summer cooling demand natural gas prices and associated coal burn these factors will dictate the level of third quarter coal buying and shipments utilities require in preparation for winter for  the company is currently planning to ship between  and  million tons with current commitments to sell  million tons which includes  million tons with export customers of this committed production  million tons are under fixedprice contracts with a weightedaverage price of  per ton the approximately  million committed tons for  that the company priced during the first quarter of  were at an average price of  per ton in line with the prevailing prices at that time the company is currently contracted to sell  million tons in  all to domestic customers of this committed production  million tons are under fixedprice contracts with a weightedaverage price of  per ton utilities continue to delay new coal purchases due to their elevated stockpiles after the very mild winter while this maximizes their flexibility it could lead to some price support for coal during periods of increased natural gas prices and electricity demand “the current outlook for us thermal coal producers is a lot brighter than it was at this time last year after good first quarter shipments many of our customers are indicating that they will continue to take their contracted tons and will buy more coal for inyear delivery if summer demand is elevated we remain optimistic that the prb could see yearoveryear demand grow by approximately  million tons or more if natural gas prices remain above  per mmbtu and we have a normal summer” said marshall international outlook international thermal coal prices remained solid during the first quarter of  as china continued to manage its domestic production levels and increase imports this left international coal supplies better matched to demand disruptions to australian coal producers caused by cyclone debbie in late march are forecast to impact the rail system until early may while metallurgical coal prices have risen rapidly newcastle thermal coal prices have stabilized above  per tonne it will take some time for the full impacts of the disruption from cyclone debbie to work their way through the system as buyers wait for supply to resume or find alternative coal sources sustained international prices have allowed the company to book export sales of  million tons for delivery throughout  strong demand should allow total  export sales volumes of approximately  million tons dependent on the capacity of the rail and port system to increase shipment rates the company continues to receive strong interest from asian customers for its spring creek coal and will seek to layer in sales for the remainder of  as opportunities arise  guidance – financial and operational estimates “first quarter shipments showed a marked improvement over the first quarter of  with solid demand from both domestic and international customers although the early end to winter and export rail challenges negatively impacted our performance we are now looking ahead to steady summer demand and normalized export rail performance while  will hold plenty of challenges including a traditionally soft second quarter the actions we took in  to control our costs and improve our financial position mean we are well placed to successfully manage through the current environment and prosper as it improves” commented marshall as explained in the february  earnings call reaching the top of the adjusted ebitda range would have required an increase in the price of export sales from then prevailing levels to reflect yeartodate sales made since then the company is lowering the top end of its adjusted ebitda guidance range

required by law nongaap financial measures this release and our related presentation include the nongaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis and for our reporting segments adjusted ebitda is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “us gaap” a quantitative reconciliation of historical net income loss to adjusted ebitda is found in the tables accompanying this release ebitda represents net income loss before  interest income expense net  income tax provision  depreciation and depletion and  amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda as further adjusted for accretion which represents noncash increases in asset retirement obligation liabilities resulting from the passage of time and specifically identified items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations for the periods presented herein the specifically identified items are  adjustments to exclude noncash impairment charges  adjustments for derivative financial instruments excluding fair value marktomarket gains or losses and including cash amounts received or paid  adjustments to exclude debt restructuring costs and  noncash throughput amortization expense related to payments made to amend the bnsf and westshore agreements we enter into certain derivative financial instruments such as put options that require the payment of premiums at contract inception the reduction in the premium value over time is reflected in the marktomarket gains or losses our calculation of adjusted ebitda does not include premiums paid for derivative financial instruments either at contract inception as these payments pertain to future settlement periods or in the period of contract settlement as the payment occurred in a preceding period in prior years the amortization of port and rail contract termination payments were included as part of ebitda and adjusted ebitda because the cash payments approximated the amount of amortization being taken during the year during  management determined that the noncash portion of amortization arising from payments made in prior years as well as the amortization of contract termination payments should be adjusted out of ebitda because the ongoing cash payments are now significantly smaller than the overall amortization of these payments and no longer reflect the transactional results because of the inherent uncertainty related to the items identified above management does not believe it is able to provide a meaningful forecast of the comparable gaap measures or reconciliation to any forecasted gaap measure adjusted ebitda is an additional tool intended to assist our management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations adjusted ebitda is a metric intended to assist management in evaluating operating performance comparing performance across periods planning and forecasting future business operations and helping determine levels of operating and capital investments periodtoperiod comparisons of adjusted ebitda are intended to help our management identify and assess additional trends potentially impacting our company that may not be shown solely by periodtoperiod comparisons of net income loss consolidated adjusted ebitda is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers and others we believe adjusted ebitda is also useful to investors analysts and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance from period to period and comparing our performance to similar operating results of other relevant companies adjusted ebitda allows investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense taxes depreciation and depletion amortization and accretion and other specifically identified items that are not considered to directly reflect our core operations our management recognizes that using adjusted ebitda as a performance measure has inherent limitations as compared to net income loss or other gaap financial measures as this nongaap measure excludes certain items including items that are recurring in nature which may be meaningful to investors as a result of these exclusions adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to net income loss or other gaap financial measures as a measure of our operating performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies cloud peak energy inc unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in thousands
