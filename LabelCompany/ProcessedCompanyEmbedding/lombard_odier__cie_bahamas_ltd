robinsonblair like its yearold parent company lombard odier  cie bahamas ltd knows all too well that selfpreservation is key to wealth preservation one of the best capitalized banks in the world the swiss private bank lombard odier darier hentsch is geneva’s oldest and second largest wealth manager click here to read or browse this feature using turnpageezine mode with no external debt and  billion in assets under management in  the independent bank seemingly has the financial wherewithal and superior global wealth management expertise to weather any economic storm its yearold bahamasbased operation is doing well to follow in its footsteps the bahamas arm of the business was established in  as a small bank functioning mainly as a booking centre with assets managed out of switzerland since then the business has continued to add on services and has operated without interruption says marc lopez lombard odier group’s managing director “initially the bahamas office was born out of european efforts” says lopez who joined lombard odier in  and was appointed a limited partner in  he is also a member of the private clients management board “the jurisdiction continues to be very attractive for us” as lombard odier seeks to expand its footprint into latin america the bahamas which presently provides a range of services in wealth management for private and institutional clients has a new and vital role to play in the swiss bank’s strategy “we intend to utilize the bahamas to expand our services throughout the caribbean basin” says renaud vielfaure managing director of lombard odier bahamas the bank he says has its own “strong base” of clients which has fuelled its growth in size and performance over the decades building on this the bahamas operation’s strong team is being called upon to help support expansions in panama which commenced in  and in another location in south america yet to be publicly announced “the nassau office will provide logistic investment and technology support to our efforts in central and south america” adds lopez “the bahamas will continue to be even more important for the group given our expansion in latin america” wellplaced highquality team the bahamas’ “highlevel” of human resources coupled with market opportunities are just a few of the reasons why lombard odier remains committed to the jurisdiction says managing partner christophe hentsch “the bahamas can be a hub it has a good background the right people and the right knowledge” adds the swiss economist who joined lombard odier in  after running the global custody department and having major responsibilities within the private clients unit hentsch was appointed managing partner in  “it’s not enough to want to serve your clients you need local quality people and we have found them if you have a stable highquality team you are well placed to serve your clients” this is becoming increasingly important in a complex dynamic global private banking environment long gone are the days when investing was easy says hentsch in the past investors could buy a few stocks and wait for the value to climb but today it is much more complicated with certain zones developing at a much slower pace he says to provide clients with uptothe minute financial advice lombard odier not only draws on the expertise of its local team but also that of a larger network of economists analysts and highlevel asset managers in geneva new york and london “we can safely say we match the highest international standards in terms of our offering of products and services” says vielfaure after  years in the jurisdiction lombard odier says it’s vested in the bahamas “we consider ourselves as a local player” says lopez “not only for the bahamas itself but for the caribbean” family ethos not many family businesses made  million in consolidated profit last year but across its main business lines lombard odier did the group is organized around three main areas of activities private clients business asset management and technology and banking services with a network of  offices in nearly  countries employing  people the business strategy behind the seventh generation wealth management firm originates from its eight owners and managers of which hentsch is one his father and grandfather before him played an active role in the company’s management “don’t underestimate the importance of independence” he says “this allows us to take a longterm view if you have outside shareholders if you borrow money if you have to publish high level results every three months then inevitably your only strategy can be to maximize profits on the expense of your clients” hentsch a seventh generation owner says his priority is not solely concentrated on turning a profit rather it is also about developing and preserving lombard odier to pass it on to the eighth generation of owners “we have developed and constantly adapted well because we are a family business we have a company within families within close families there are common values and a common approach” says hentsch “our strategy is not what is going to happen in three months for immediate profit the planning model is what’s going to happen for the next generation” that family ethos also accounts for how the global wealth management firm attracts and retains its clients in an ongoing fight to secure market share lombard odier taps into new business through membership in key family business associations such as the family business network international fbni a network which encompasses over  family members in more than  countries lombard odier is also a member of les henokiens an association which brings together dozens of prominent european and japanese family businesses noted for their longevity at least  years in existence and robust financial health “the biggest majority of companies in the world are in fact family businesses they all have the same question that anybody has when they have wealth ‘how can you transmit the company or the wealth to the next generation’” says hentsch “we have commissioned and published research about this this is a way of creating the network and getting your market share in a very targeted way we use very narrow channels to go to different types of clients we are not in the retail business at all we don’t target masses of clients” securing market share a clientcentred approach to doing business excellent fund performance and staking out a strong leadership role in financial technology helps to distinguish the company from its competitors according to the lombard odier executives “securing market share is the reason why we get up every morning and we go to the office” says hentsch “happy clients bring more clients we love what we do we love this company” with a clientcentred approach to business the private bank works to keep abreast of clients’ needs and any changes to those needs as clients become more sophisticated when it comes to analysing their portfolio’s performance transparent reporting is crucial “clients seek transparent types of investment and a clear approach they want to understand exactly what is done and how it’s done and where the performance came from” says hentsch “we have adapted to have an extremely accurate reporting method for our clients an extremely fine way of tracking their performance and risks in their portfolio and we only recommend investment for our clients that we understand and would be prepared to invest in ourselves” with an extensive wealth and estate planning team based in geneva lombard odier keeps the expertise unified and provides support to private bankers in other parts of the world good public visibility comes directly and indirectly to lombard odier whether through its funds performing extremely well hosting informative presentations funding studies or publishing books collectively it all works to further cement the company’s role as an industry leader and innovator the board says “we have such a high level of technology that a number of banks have decided to fully rely on the systems of lombard odier … to be powered by lombard odier” says hentsch “because we have this very good technology and very efficient back office with very reliable people there are some companies that have asked us to do their it work that is a way of gaining market share and financing research and development for the platform” when it comes to nurturing client relationships lombard odier stands out says lopez adding that it does not carry any conflict of interest within itself it also boasts a very low rate of staffturnover which helps to develop trust clients often stay with the firm for well over a generation as lombard odier’s interests are aligned with that of its large and family clients who are concerned with stability and the preservation of wealth for generations to come although an established independent family bank lombard odier says it offers investment services and products rivalling those offered by the largest modern conglomerates “it is the old world and the new world coming together

styles of wine the distinction between old world wine regions and new world wine regions is particularly important as a sweeping generalization old world regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven while new world regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity for example cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in france will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors while cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in california will likely produce wines that are more fruitforward but different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes for example within france bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from cabernet sauvignon merlot and cabernet franc grapes while burgundy is associated with red wines made from the pinot noir grape use this page to find toprated wines from wine regions throughout the world and learn about each region’s winemaking profile europe france alsace bordeaux
