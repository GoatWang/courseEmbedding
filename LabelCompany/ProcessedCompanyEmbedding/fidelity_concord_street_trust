another index if that index is deemed more representative of the performance of us common stocks the fund may not always hold all of the same securities as the sp  geode may use statistical sampling techniques to attempt to replicate the returns of the sp  statistical sampling techniques attempt to match the investment characteristics of the index and the fund by taking into account such factors as capitalization industry exposures dividend yield pe ratio pb ratio and earnings growth the fund may not track the index perfectly because differences between the index and the funds portfolio can cause differences in performance in addition expenses and transaction costs the size and frequency of cash flows into and out of the fund and differences between how and when the fund and the index are valued can cause differences in performance geode may lend the funds securities to brokerdealers or other institutions to earn income for the fund in addition to the principal investment strategies discussed above geode may use various techniques such as buying and selling futures contracts swaps and exchange traded funds to increase or decrease the funds exposure to changing security prices or other factors that affect security values if geodes strategies do not work as intended the fund may not achieve its objective description of principal security types equity securities

issuers within an industry or economic sector or geographic region or the market as a whole issuerspecific changes changes in the financial condition of an issuer or counterparty changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect a securitys or instruments value the value of securities of smaller less wellknown issuers can be more volatile than that of larger issuers in response to market economic political or other conditions geode may temporarily use a different

notice to shareholders spartan us equity index fund normally invests at least  of its assets in common stocks included in the sp  valuing shares the fund is open for business each day the new york stock exchange nyse is open the funds net asset value per share nav is the value of a single share fidelity normally calculates the funds nav as of the close of business of the nyse normally  pm eastern time however nav may be calculated earlier if trading on the nyse is restricted or as permitted by the securities and exchange commission sec the funds assets are valued as of this time for the purpose of computing the funds nav prospectus to the extent that the funds assets are traded in other markets on days when the fund is not open for business the value of the funds assets may be affected on those days in addition trading in some of the funds assets may not occur on days when the fund is open for business the funds assets are valued primarily on the basis of market quotations or official closing prices certain shortterm securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost if market quotations or official closing prices are not readily available or do not accurately reflect fair value for a security or if a securitys value has been materially affected by events occurring after the close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded that security will be valued by another method that the board of trustees believes accurately reflects fair value in accordance with the boards fair value pricing policies for example arbitrage opportunities may exist when trading in a portfolio security or securities is halted and does not resume before the fund calculates its nav these arbitrage opportunities may enable shortterm traders to dilute the nav of longterm investors securities trading in overseas markets present time zone arbitrage opportunities when events affecting portfolio security values occur after the close of the overseas market but prior to the close of the us market to the extent the fund invests in other openend funds the fund will calculate its nav using the nav of the underlying funds in which it invests as described in the underlying funds prospectuses the fund may invest in other fidelity funds that use the same fair value pricing policies as the fund or in fidelity money market funds a securitys valuation may differ depending on the method used for determining value fair valuation of a funds portfolio securities can serve to reduce arbitrage opportunities available to shortterm traders but there is no assurance that fair value pricing policies will prevent dilution of the funds nav by shortterm traders while the fund has policies regarding excessive trading these too may not be effective to prevent shortterm

compensation plans  plans frequent purchases and sales of fund shares can harm shareholders in various ways including reducing the returns to longterm shareholders by increasing costs to the fund such as brokerage commissions disrupting portfolio management strategies and diluting the value of the shares of longterm shareholders in cases in which fluctuations in markets are not fully priced into the funds nav accordingly the board of trustees has adopted policies and procedures designed to discourage excessive or shortterm trading of fund shares however there is the risk that the funds policies and procedures will prove ineffective in whole or in part to detect or prevent frequent trading the fund may alter its policies at any time without prior notice to shareholders there is no minimum holding period and shareholders can sell their shares at any time shareholders will ordinarily comply with the funds policies regarding excessive trading by allowing  days to pass after each investment before they sell or exchange from the fund the fund may take action if shares are held longer than  days if the trading is disruptive for other reasons such as unusually large trade size the fund reserves the right but does not have the obligation to reject any purchase or exchange transaction at any time in addition the fund reserves the right to impose restrictions on purchases or exchanges at any time or conditions that are more restrictive on disruptive excessive or shortterm trading than those that are otherwise stated in this prospectus excessive trading activity is measured by the number of roundtrip transactions in a shareholders account a roundtrip transaction occurs when a shareholder buys and then sells shares of a fund within  days shareholders are limited to two roundtrip transactions per fund within any rolling day period subject to an overall limit of four roundtrip transactions across all fidelity funds over a rolling month period transactions of  or less systematic withdrawal andor contribution programs mandatory retirement distributions and transactions initiated by a plan sponsor will not count toward the roundtrip limits for employersponsored retirement plans only participant directed exchanges will count toward the roundtrip limits prospectus shareholders with two or more roundtrip transactions in a single fund within a rolling day period will be blocked from making additional purchases or exchange purchases of the fund for  days shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions across all fidelity funds within any rolling month period will be blocked for  days from additional purchases or exchange purchases across all fidelity funds any roundtrip within  months of the expiration of a multifund block will initiate another multifund block for an day period for repeat offenders fmr may but does not have the obligation to impose longterm or permanent blocks on purchase or exchange purchase transactions in

may still be invested in the fund qualified wrap programs will be monitored by matching the advisers orders for purchase exchange or sale transactions in fund shares to determine if the advisers orders comply with the funds frequent trading policies additions to and withdrawals from a qualified wrap program by the advisers client will not be matched with transactions initiated by the adviser therefore if the adviser buys shares of a fund and an individual client subsequently sells shares of the same fund within  days the clients transaction is not matched with the advisers and therefore does not count as a roundtrip however client initiated transactions are subject to the funds policies on frequent trading and individual clients will be subject to restrictions due to their frequent trading in a wrap account excessive trading by an adviser will lead to fund blocks and the wrap program will cease to be a qualified wrap program if the wrap program is blocked from making additional purchases or exchange purchases of a fund because of excessive trading by the adviser the wrap program will no longer be considered qualified and any transaction whether initiated by the adviser or the client will be matched when counting roundtrips commencing no later than march   wrap account client purchases and sale transactions will be monitored under the funds monitoring policy as though the wrap clients were fund shareholders a qualified wrap program is i a program whose adviser certifies that it has investment discretion over  million or more in client assets invested in mutual funds at the time of the certification ii a program in which the adviser directs transactions in the accounts participating in the program in concert with changes in a model portfolio and iii managed by an adviser who agrees to give fmr sufficient information to permit fmr to identify the individual accounts in the wrap program the funds excessive trade monitoring policy described above does not apply to transactions initiated by the trustee or adviser to a donoradvised charitable gift fund qualified fundoffunds or other strategy funds or omnibus accounts trustees or advisers of donoradvised

that its investment strategy will not lead to excessive trading strategy funds must commence monitoring for excessive trading no later than march   omnibus accounts are maintained by intermediaries acting on behalf of multiple investors whose individual trades are not ordinarily disclosed to the fund shortterm trading by these investors is likely to go undetected by the fund and may increase

historical performance you can look at the total percentage change in value the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical  investment total return reflects the change in the value of an investment assuming reinvestment of dividend income and capital gains the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value if fidelity had not reimbursed certain fund expenses the total returns would have been lower cumulative total returns periods ended february   past  past  life of year years fund spartan us equity index fund    sp registered trademark    sp  index objective funds average   na cumulative total returns show the funds performance in percentage terms over a set period  in this case one year five years or since the fund started on february   for example if you had invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year you would have  for comparison you can look at the performance of the standard  poors  index  a widely recognized unmanaged index of common stocks to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the sp  index objective funds average which reflects the performance of  mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by lipper analytical services inc over the past one year both benchmarks reflect reinvestment of dividends and capital gains if any and exclude the effect of sales charges average annual total returns periods ended february   past  past  life of year years fund spartan us equity index fund    sp     sp  index objective funds average   na average annual total returns take the funds cumulative return and show you what would have happened if the fund had performed at a constant rate each year note lipper calculates average annual total returns by annualizing each funds total return then taking an arithmetic average this may produce a slightly different figure than that obtained by averaging the cumulative total returns and annualizing the result  over life of fund                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            over life of fund lets say hypothetically that  was invested in spartan us equity index fund on february   when the fund started as the chart shows by february   the value of the investment would have grown to   a  increase on the initial investment for comparison look at how the sp  did over the same period with dividends and capital gains if any reinvested the same  investment in the sp  would have grown to   a  increase understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow the stock market for example has a history of growth in the long run and volatility in the short run in turn the share price and return of a fund that invests in stocks or bonds will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money but if you can ride out the markets ups and downs you may have a gain checkmark fund talk the managers overview an interview with jennifer farrelly portfolio manager of spartan us equity index fund formerly fidelity us equity index portfolio q how did the fund perform jennifer a for the month period that ended february   the fund had a total return of  that compares with the  return of the standard  poors  index for the same period of course the funds total return is slightly lower than the index due to expenses additionally the sp  index objective funds average as tracked by lipper analytical services returned  for the month period q what have been some of the major developments in the market recently a throughout the past  months the market has been able to shake off brief downturns and rebound strongly for example in early december  federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan caused markets to tumble worldwide when he hinted at the irrational exuberance of the stock market however sentiment toward stocks remained optimistic because the economy posted slow but steady growth with relatively low inflation for most of the period investors took heart that the economy wasnt growing so fast that it might spawn a rise in interest rates that could erode corporate profits at the end of february however greenspan noted in his semiannual congressional testimony that the fed might be inclined to raise shortterm interest rates modestly in the first half of  as a preemptive strike against possible inflation caused by a tight labor market q in such a strong market earnings reports must have been solid    a yes they were in  both third quarter and fourth quarter earnings came in stronger than expected nevertheless there were some concerns that corporate earnings might begin to show some weakness for one thing the dollar remained strong raising the costs of american goods abroad for another a tight labor market raised the potential for increased wages and lower profits presently companies have very little pricing power making it very difficult for them to pass on higher employment costs in the form of price increases q largecapitalization stocks continued to be the market leaders why is that a what weve witnessed this year is what investors call a flight to quality where largecapitalization companies are sought because of their stable earnings growth and liquidity as the market climbs higher and higher it becomes more difficult for portfolio managers to pick stocks that will outperform therefore many managers have moved to larger companies with established track records as a way of keeping up with the market some largecap stocks also are considered defensive because they are not influenced by the vagaries of the economy in the past few months investors sought defensive stocks  such as food or personal care companies  because they offer steady earnings growth in an environment where it can be difficult to discern the strength of the economy q technology proved to be one of the market leaders why was that a among the many factors that drove this sector was strongerthanexpected personal computer sales  up  in  from  this demand buoyed many companies with pcrelated products for example memory chip maker intel posted very strong earnings gains microsoft also continued its dominance of the software business in february  however the technology sector faltered largely because the groups valuations were very high and some companies reported earnings slowdowns for example the distribution channels that sell personal computers  a leading indicator of technology demand  reported mediocre results q financial companies also performed well    a yes they did bank stocks thrived helped by steadily improving earnings strong balance sheets and a greater emphasis on feebased businesses additionally banks enjoyed a relatively benign interest rate environment brokerage firms also continued to reap the rewards of a booming stock market q what were the main drivers behind the strong performance of energy stocks a the price of the underlying commodities  oil and natural gas  shot up in  due to a positive supply and demand dynamic and the stocks followed suit however since the beginning of  the price of oil has dropped about  and energyrelated stocks have suffered q were there any sectors that proved to be laggards a utility stocks struggled the sector underperformed the broad market due to concerns about how deregulation would affect utility companies especially telephone and electric companies also utility stocks tend to trade up and down with bonds and the bond market underperformed the stock market significantly the one positive area of the sector was natural gas which benefited from the higher energy prices i just described q whats your outlook a one major wild card is the effect of possible fed interest rate increases and their influence on corporate earnings in addition investors should understand there is still a great deal of uncertainty given the stock markets historically high valuations and the questionable sustainability of future corporate earnings growth the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions fund facts goal seeks a total return which corresponds to that of the standard  poors  index start date february   size as of february   more than  billion manager jennifer farrelly since  manager spartan market

annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical  investment total return reflects the change in the value of an investment assuming reinvestment of dividend income and capital gains the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value you can also look at the funds income as reflected in the funds yield to measure performance if fidelity had not reimbursed certain fund expenses the total returns and dividends would have been lower cumulative total returns periods ended february   past  past  life of year years fund fidelity us bond index    lehman brothers aggregate bond index   na intermediate us government funds   na average cumulative total returns show the funds performance in percentage terms over a set period  in this case one year five years or

performance of the lehman brothers aggregate bond index  a market value weighted performance benchmark for investmentgrade fixedrate debt issues including government corporate assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities with maturities of at least one year to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the intermediate us government funds average

    over life of fund lets say hypothetically that  was invested in fidelity us bond index fund on march   shortly after the fund started as the chart shows by february   the value of the investment would have grown to   an  increase on the initial investment for comparison look at how the lehman brothers aggregate bond index did over the same period with dividends and capital gains if any reinvested the same  would have grown to   an  increase understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow bond prices for example generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates in turn the share price return and yield of a fund that invests in bonds will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money

talk the managers overview an interview with jennifer farrelly portfolio manager of spartan us equity index fund formerly fidelity us equity index portfolio q christine how has the fund performed a even though the fixedincome markets were volatile throughout the year the funds performance closely tracked the lehman brothers aggregate bond index just as it is designed to do for the year ending february   the funds total return was  and the lehman brothers aggregate bond index returned  the funds total return is slightly lower than the index due to operating expenses for another comparison the intermediate us government funds average returned  as tracked by lipper analytical services q how did individual sectors of the taxable bond market fare a throughout the past year the nongovernment sectors  including mortgagebacked assetbacked and corporate securities  were the best performers their performance was driven by tightening yield spreads  which means that the difference in yields between treasury securities and other sectors of the market became quite narrow that tightening reflected a consistent increase in demand for higheryielding securities together with moderate new issue activity q turning to the fund what accounted for its performance a individual security selection helped the fund somewhat offset expenses and transaction costs and perform closely in line with the index since the index is made up of more than  individual securities its impractical for the fund to own everything in it in choosing the funds investments i use a technique known as statistical sampling this process entails assembling a portfolio that replicates the characteristics of the index  which can include duration sector maturity credit quality and others  by investing in representative issues q lets begin with your choices in the mortgage sector    a mortgagebacked securities typically are very sensitive to changes in interest rates because they are subject to prepayment risk  the risk that mortgage holders will refinance or pay off their mortgages before maturity even though interest rates fluctuated throughout the year they remained in a broad range never falling low enough to trigger a large new wave of mortgage refinancing activity in this environment i focused on current coupon mortgages  those issued at or near current interest rates  because i felt that they were attractively priced relative to other mortgage securities even though current coupon bonds are highly sensitive to falling interest rates this strategy benefited the fund because prepayment trends turned out to be close to market expectations by the end of the period the funds mortgage holdings were fairly evenly distributed among various coupon mortgages replicating the aggregate bond indexs composition q what was your strategy within the corporate sector a i increased the funds holdings in yankee bonds which are dollardenominated bonds issued in the united states by foreign banks corporations and governments and maintained a modest overweighting in bank securities relative to the index yankee bonds make up one of the fastest growing sectors of the fixedincome markets and during the year the sector offered many attractive opportunities since some investors dont invest in foreign issues these securities often offer higher yields i underweighted bonds issued by industrial concerns including manufacturing and consumer product companies my continued emphasis on banks was a plus for the fund as many banks capitalization profitability and asset quality improved or remained strong whats more mergers and acquisitions within the banking sector continued and many banks involved emerged as stronger entities q with interest rates volatile did you emphasize the shortermaturity treasury securities since they are less sensitive to interest rate moves a no i didnt it is important to remember that the fund does not make interest rate timing bets rather i structure the fund to replicate the distribution of the indexs duration  a measure of interest rate sensitivity  across the various maturities available however i did choose individual treasury securities that i felt offered value and the potential to outperform others for example i generally favored older treasury securities while avoiding morerecently issued securities newly issued treasuries have a higher amount of liquidity meaning they are more actively traded for that reason their prices tend to be higher and their yields lower than older treasury securities with comparable maturities because the funds treasury positions are core holdings the fund doesnt necessarily require additional liquidity of the newest issues q whats your outlook for the fund a as always the funds returns will be determined primarily by the direction of interest rates because valuations across sectors and between individual security types are very compressed there is less room to differentiate performance based on a security selection than in the past in this environment with the fund positioned to closely replicate that of the lehman brothers aggregate bond index its performance is expected to track that of the market as represented by this index the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions fund facts goal to provide returns consistent with those of the lehman brothers aggregate bond index start date march  size as of february   more than  million manager christine thompson since  manager fidelity intermediate bond fund since  comanager fidelity global bond fund since  fidelity target timeline funds since  joined fidelity in  checkmark christine thompson on changes to the lehman brothers aggregate bond index market indexes are not static the index providers  such as lehman brothers  often add new securities to their indexes as there are innovations in the markets recently lehman has added a couple of new types of securities to its aggregate bond index the first are capital securities which are issued primarily by banks as securities into a trust and the trust in turn issues certificates to investors by the end of the period about  of these issues were included in the index and the category is growing quite quickly lehman also added treasury inflation index notes commonly referred to as inflationindexed treasuries i chose to invest in some capital securities before their official inclusion because i thought their prices were attractive relative to other corporate securities on the other hand i didnt immediately add inflationindexed bonds because i felt that their inclusion in the index wasnt material enough to affect the performance of the index investment changes quality diversification as of february   moodys ratings  of funds  of

associated with securities lending transactions  applicants request relief to permit a the adviser and the subadvised funds to hire subadvisers and materially amend the subadvisory agreements without shareholder approval b the lending funds to use cash collateral to purchase shares of the investment funds and the investment funds to redeem shares from the lending funds and c an agent to receive fees based on a share of the revenue generated by the securities lending activities of a lending fund applicants legal analysis a relief to hire subadvisers and materially amend subadvisory agreements  section a of the act provides in relevant part that it is unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company except pursuant to a written contract that has been approved by the vote of the companys outstanding voting securities rule f under the act provides that each series or class of stock in a series company affected by a matter must approve such matter if the act requires shareholder approval  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision of the act or from any rule thereunder if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy start printed page and provisions of the act applicants request an exemption under section c of the act from section a of the act and rule f under the act to permit the adviser and the subadvised funds subject to approval by the board to enter into and materially amend subadvisory agreements without shareholder approval the requested relief would not extend to any subadviser that is an affiliated person as defined in section a of the act of the company the subadvised fund or the adviser other than by reason of serving as a subadviser to one or more of the subadvised funds “affiliated subadviser”  applicants assert that investors expect the adviser and the board to select one or more subadvisers for the subadvised funds and look to the adviser when they have questions or concerns about the subadvised funds management or investment performance applicants contend that the role of the subadviser from the perspective of the investor is comparable to that of the individual portfolio managers employed by other investment advisory firms applicants also contend that requiring shareholder approval of subadvisory agreements would impose expenses and unnecessary delays on the subadvised funds and could prevent the prompt implementation of actions deemed advisable by the adviser and the board applicants note that the advisory agreements will continue to be fully subject to section  of the act and rule f under the act b investment of cash collateral by the lending funds in the investment funds  section da of the act provides in relevant part that no registered investment company may acquire securities of another investment company if such securities represent more than  of the acquired companys outstanding voting stock more than  of the acquiring companys total assets or if such securities together with the securities of other acquired investment companies represent more than  of the acquiring companys total assets section db of the act provides that no registered openend investment company may sell its securities to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than  of the acquired companys voting stock or if the sale will cause more than  of the acquired companys voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally  section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction from any provision of section d if and to the extent that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors applicants request relief under section dj to permit the lending funds to invest cash collateral in the registered investment funds in excess of the limits in sections da and b  applicants represent that the investment funds will be designed as vehicles to be used specifically in connection with securities lending transactions applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not result in inappropriate layering of either sales charges or investment advisory fees shares of the investment funds sold to the lending funds will not be subject to a sales load redemption fee assetbased distribution fee or service fee applicants further state that since investment advisory fees are calculated on the net rather than the total assets of the lending funds and since cash collateral does not increase net assets the lending funds would not pay duplicative advisory fees with respect to investments made with cash collateral applicants also state that each investment fund will be operated for the purpose of providing the necessary liquidity to satisfy the demands of the lending program and therefore will not be susceptible to control through the threat of large scale redemptions finally applicants state that an investment fund will not acquire securities of any other investment company in excess of the limits contained in section da of the act except to the extent permitted by condition  of the conditions regarding participating in a lending program below for these reasons applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not give rise to the abuses that sections da and b were intended to prevent  section a of the act makes it unlawful for any affiliated person or principal underwriter of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person “secondtier affiliate” acting as principal to sell or purchase any security to or from such investment company section a of the act defines an affiliated person to include any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person as well as any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person and in the case of an investment company its investment adviser the adviser is an affiliated person of each lending fund under section a because the lending funds share a common investment adviser the lending funds may be deemed to be under “common control” and therefore affiliated persons of each other in addition a lending fund could own more than  of the outstanding voting securities of an investment fund as a result each lending fund and the investment fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons or secondtier affiliates of each other lending fund as a result applicants request relief from section a under sections c and b to permit the sale of shares of the investment funds to the lending funds and the redemption of the shares by the lending funds from the investment funds  section b of the act authorizes the sec to exempt a transaction from section a if the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general policy of the act  applicants submit that the requested relief satisfies the standards for relief in sections c and b applicants state that the lending funds will be treated like any other shareholders in the investment funds and purchase and sell shares of the investment funds on the same terms and on the same basis including price as all other shareholders of the investment funds applicants assert that the proposed transactions comply with each lending funds investment restrictions and policies applicants state that cash collateral of a lending fund that is a money market fund will not be used to acquire shares of any investment fund that does not comply with rule a under the act applicants further state that the investment of cash collateral will comply with all present and future commission and staff positions concerning securities lending applicants also state that the private investment funds will comply with the major substantive provisions of the act including the prohibitions against affiliated transactions leveraging and issuing senior securities and rights of redemption  section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit any start printed page affiliated person of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company or any secondtier affiliate acting as principal from effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit sharing plan in which the investment company participates rule d permits the sec to approve a proposed joint transaction covered by the terms of section d in determining whether to approve a transaction the sec is to consider whether the proposed transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the participation of the investment companies is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants  applicants state that the lending funds by purchasing and redeeming shares of the investment funds a subadviser by managing the portfolio securities of the subadvised funds while at the same time acting as agent for the lending funds an agent by acting as lending agent investing cash collateral in the investment funds and receiving a portion of the revenue generated by securities lending transactions and the investment funds by selling shares to and redeeming shares from the lending funds could be deemed to be participants in a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement within the meaning of section d of the act and rule d under the act applicants submit that the proposed investments by the lending funds in the investment funds meet the standards of rule d for the reasons discussed above particularly that the lending funds will invest in the investment funds on the same basis as any other shareholder c payment of fees by a lending fund to an agent  as noted above section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit joint transactions involving investment companies and their affiliated persons unless the sec has approved the transaction applicants state that an agent may serve as a subadviser for certain series of a particular company while other series of that company could be advised by entities that are not affiliated with the agent each series of the company could be deemed to be under common control and thus an affiliated person of each other series the agent thus could be deemed an affiliated person of any series for which it acts as subadviser and a secondtier affiliate of those series for which it does not act as subadviser moreover an agent that is a bank may own more than  of the voting securities of a lending fund in a fiduciary capacity and thus be an affiliated person of that lending fund and a secondtier affiliate of those series of a company in which it does not own a  interest further if a lending fund acquired more than  of the outstanding voting securities of an investment fund advised by the agent the agent could be deemed a secondtier affiliate of the lending fund as a result the prohibitions of section d and rule d would apply to activities involving the series and the agent including the agents activities as lending agent and the receipt of a share of the revenue from the series lending activities applicants request relief to permit an agent acting as lending agent to a lending fund to receive a percentage of the revenue generated by the lending funds participation in the lending program each agent will have an established securities lending program with numerous other unaffiliated institutional investors participating as lenders in the agents program  applicants propose that each lending fund will adopt the following procedures to ensure that the proposed fee arrangement and the other terms governing the relationship with the agent will meet the standards of rule d a in connection with the approval of the agent as
