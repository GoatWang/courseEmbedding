companys website now i will turn the call over to dr hartnett dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you mike and good morning to all net sales for the first quarter fiscal  were  million versus  million for the same period last year an  increase our aerospace markets increased  on a yearoveryear basis and our industrial markets increased  for the first quarter fiscal  sales of industrial products represented  of our net sales with aerospace products at  adjusted gross margin for the first quarter fiscal  was  million or  of net sales compared to  million or  for the same period last year this difference is mainly attributed to mix last year only two months of sargent were represented adjusted ebitda for the period was  million versus  million last year a  improvement adjusted eps for the quarter was  in this quarter we saw a larger component of our sales from the sargent businesses than the same quarter last year these sales are normally at lower margins than the classic rbc products and we are working to improve that and well talk about that later in addition there were a few higher margin aftermarket sales as a result of order there were fewer higher margin aftermarket sales as a result of order timing this will be reversing later in the year this market is lumpy and we can distort the normal cadence of profitability from one quarter to the next but it should even out for the year looking at components of our aerospace and defense business this period we saw aerospace oem up a strong  offset by defense oem which was up  yielding up positive  for this sector of our business the defense component weakness is all attributed to delayed shipment of a complex electromechanical assemblies from a sargent plant and support of added testing by one of our customers this should catch up with itself in the second quarter were seeing exciting customer acceptance of the rbc sargent companies in the market leading to a substantial number of large opportunities for the business these opportunities fit well into our warehouse and provide an excellent path for oem aerospace growth in future years as a magnitude of new aircraft systems reached substantial build rates on a consolidated basis the above market components yielded the aforementioned  expansion for aerospace and defense side of the segment in the first quarter lets now turn to our industrial businesses overall they were up  for the quarter there are a lot of moving parts in the industrial franchise and ill explain what were seeing we see strength in market demand for marine producers of semiconductor equipment ground defense auto and industrial gas turbines and train were also seeing explore on demand for mining products with a steady demand for those products having been demonstrated over several quarters weakness in demand was experienced in the markets of heavy truck and oil and gas the stronger markets are offsetting the weaker ones to show the growth that we mentioned earlier by far the weakest demand is from the oil and gas sector i expect a little improvement here this year on margin improvement initiatives underway at the sargent company we are on track as i discussed in our last call the four sources of improvement are insourcing evolving sargent purchases to rbc plants improvement of planning and manufacturing methods of sargent plants mixed management and of course continued improvements of rbc core gross margins resulting from maturing and new cost reduction projects ill talk a little bit about fiscal  today were seeing an increase in demand on the second half of our year this is driven mainly by aerospace and defense sector and is also in part governed by lead time considerations aircraft build rate increases and in response to customer demand customer required dates of shipment regarding our second quarter were expecting to see sales in the second quarter fiscal  in the neighborhood of  million to  million compared to  million last year ill now turn the call over to dan who will provide more details on the financial aspects daniel a bergeron  chief financial officer director  vice president thanks mike since mikes already covered sales and gross margin ill jump down to sga sga for the first quarter of fiscal  was  million compared to  million for the same period last year as a percentage of net sales sga was  for the first quarter of fiscal  compared to  for the same period last year excluding the onemonth impact of the sargent acquisition of  million sga yearoveryear increased  million which was mainly due to  million stock compensation expense and  million in other miscellaneous items other operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal  was expense of  million compared to expense of  million for the same period last year for the first quarter of fiscal  other operating expenses were comprised of mainly  million in the amortization of intangible assets operating income was  million for the first quarter of fiscal  compared to operating income of  million for the same period in fiscal  on an adjusted basis operating income would have been  million for the first quarter fiscal  compared to  million for the same period last year adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales would have been  for the first quarter of fiscal  compared to  for the same period last year for the first quarter of fiscal  the company reported net income of  million compared to net income of  million for the same period last year on an adjusted basis net income would have been  million for the first quarter of fiscal  compared to net income of  million for the same period last year diluted earnings per share was  per share for the first quarter of fiscal  compared to  per share for the same period last year on an adjusted basis diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal  would have been  per share compared to a diluted eps adjusted of  per share for the same period last year turning to cash flow the company generated  million in cash from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal  compared to  million for the same period last year capital expenditures were  million in the first quarter of fiscal  compared to  million for the same period last year in the first quarter of fiscal  the company paid down  million of debt and repurchased  million worth of companys stock the company ended the first quarter of fiscal  with  million of cash on the balance sheet i would now like to turn the call back to the operator to begin the qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of kristine liwag of bank of america kristine tan liwag  bank of america merrill lynch hey guys good morning dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning daniel a bergeron  chief financial officer director  vice president good morning kristine kristine tan liwag  bank of america merrill lynch a couple of quick questions first i was looking at your sga in the quarter and i was wondering whether or not this is kind of a new run rate of sga we should expect going forward or do we go back to the  range that you had before sargent daniel a bergeron  chief financial officer director  vice president yeah i think last year weve finished the year at  and so for the first quarter we were at  and our goal is to continue to work and get a little more leverage out of that number and get it back closer to that  range over the next  months to  months kristine tan liwag  bank of america merrill lynch great and then the defense weakness that you highlighted in the quarter can you provide a little bit more qualitative information and what drove that dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer could you ask that again kristine you broke up a little bit kristine tan liwag  bank of america merrill lynch is this better for the defense weakness that you highlighted in your press release can you talk a little bit more about what drove that and maybe give us a little bit more qualitative details dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean – well it has two components i mean there is the defense oem and then there is the defense aftermarket in the defense aftermarket they only buy products when they need them and its hard to predict in any given quarter when theyre going to buy those and we took in – a fairly nice amount of orders in the first quarter for those products which we cant deliver – theres a lead time associate with those orders so those products will come out later in the year and those are for sort of traditional systems that weve been sourced down for more than a generation from the basis of the current defense aircraft business the oem component is – a lot of the new oem systems that are coming out defense oem systems are early in their cycle theyre extremely complex products electromechanical hydraulic assemblies that – theyre very sophisticated and so theres a great deal of care required and oversight required in order to make sure that that system once its shipped performs exactly as it was designed and so – and its really a learning curve maturity thing and were right at the beginning of that learning curve and we see the – you can see that the jsf joint strike fighter numbers really start picking up in terms of production rates in the next few years and we have a substantial part of that business and so thats what were working on kristine tan liwag  bank of america merrill lynch great and maybe lastly for me can you discuss your gross margin progress and three facilities that you had previously mentioned from sargent that they were kind of below overall company margins in miami canada and torrance is there an update for those facilities and are they closed now to company level gross margins dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i think on those three facilities miami has made great progress and were very optimistic about what theyre doing down there and the progress that they are making and its a little beyond – its definitely beyond what our expectations were for that business at this stage so were very encouraged by what we see in miami canada really weve just begun working on the canada project in a serious mode here in the last quarter and so we dont have – we havent changed the results of canada yet at all and torrance is on the bubble right now and so were trying to study how to bring torrance – how to improve torrances margin another  over the next  months and i think we have a pretty good line of sight on how to do that and so thats currently in the works torrances margin i believe has increased the acquisition somewhere around  or  and i think there is probably another  to  in there and so weve targeted the next  kristine tan liwag  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of steve barger of keybanc capital markets steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc hi good morning guys dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning steve daniel a bergeron  chief financial officer director  vice president good morning steve steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc were hearing from some other companies through the reporting season that the aero aftermarket supply chain is still having some disruption could you tell us what the most recent activities are there and any changes that youre seeing in order or payment patterns dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer i have to do a little research there that supply chain for us in terms of shipments in the quarter was definitely down but its in no way alarming because of – its an up again down again kind of business profile for them and it has been for years theres been a lot of management changes in that sector over the past  months and i think the new management is really just getting into the saddle and learning the business so i suspect that some of that up and down has been a result of order patterns that were delayed and shouldnt have been so thats kind of what were seeing steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc so you dont think theres anything structural going on you think this will work itself out dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer well i think structurally whats going on is the boeing tfs is having an impact on that sector people cant afford to be buying from some of the distributors are trying to go to the oem direct and buy around what used to historically be the distributor channel so i think theres some – theyre facing some headwinds and i cant tell you that i understand the amount of headwinds that theyre facing we are seeing a pickup in our oem business that here and there would normally come through the distribution channel so there is definitely some shifting going around steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc right but the net effect isnt too negative for you dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer no i mean what we dont pick up on the distributor channel we pick up from the oem so theres no negative impact steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc and so no effect really on working cap in terms of either inventory or payables as you work through that dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer none that were aware of steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc okay most industrial companies are coming in light on revenue across most end markets any particular bright spots or areas of weakness that you want to highlight dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer well i think ill just kind of go over what i said earlier i think that kind of summarizes it but the bright spots are definitely as we classify marine and semiconductor industrial gas turbines is certainly a bright spot a floor for mining products mining is an important part of what we do and seeing a nice solid floor there is good for us and ground defense has been fairly steady so those are the strong parts the weak point parts are heavy truck which is sort of backing off a little bit i think everybody kind of knows the profile of whats going on in the heavy truck business right and new orders are down  build rates are down  so thats not completely unexpected and oil and gas i mean today no one is making a profit pumping energy from the ground in the united states theres a tremendous supply demand imbalance and it began inventory overhang and fracking has completely changed the game and an overcorrection is inevitable theres too much capacity has been liquidated in that entire oil service industry to support a normal steady state run rate in the oil services – in the oil business so youre going to see oil in the  to  a barrel range spiking as soon as imbalance is created its not going to stay there but theres going to be a big supply imbalance and of course everybody will be rushing for the bar for a free drink on that one but the future is really going to revolve around fracking and the economics of fracking and can offshore oil compete with the economics of fracking i dont know if id want to be in transocean business and can the tar sands compete with fracking economics i dont think id want to be in suncors business so there is going to be some big changes afoot and right now were trying to study exactly how to position our product lines for the other side of this when supply and demand become balanced and fracking is the flywheel of the economics behind oil so thats how we see oil and gas and right now on the oil service equipment side nothing is going on steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc right no i think thats good point in terms of thinking about how to position and i guess that just from a broader sense can you talk about new quoting activity that you have out there and how quote conversion is running for new product lines that you may be trying to get into dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer for the industrial aerospace or both steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc both dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer both well for the aerospace side were seeing really substantial demand for products that will be shipping  and beyond and actually its requiring us to do a capacity demand analysis by plan and we call that kind of a layer cake analysis here were going to definitely need to have capacity expanded in some of our plants were trying to determine given the build rates what weve acquired in terms of contracts where we are highly likely – have been told were highly likely to receive major new contracts exactly what capacity additions were going to need in which plants in order to service this business in  and beyond so build rate increases and increase in mix and some shuffling going on in the aircraft supply chain on whos going to make which product for boeing and airbus is – we seem to be a big beneficiary of that right now i think on the industrial side i think for the shortterm its probably going to be more of the same and i think for the longer term we have some really big projects that will come into commercialization in the late    timeframe which by that could add revenues in the low eight figures for us so steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc  dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah weve had some really nice projects that weve been either awarded or primary on that we have a high confidence we will be awarded so the industrial has got longterm good and in shortterm its more of the same steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc so just to followup on a couple points there one where your beneficiary of the mix and build rate exposure can you tell us what are those different bearing product lines that youre taking from another oem are they related products that are coming through the sargent acquisition just where are you seeing that increased content dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer both theyre bearing products that weve been supplying for a long time for these systems and build rate increases thats in excel spreadsheet project right steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc right dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer weve got so much content for plane for bearing size and how many planes and what does that mean for – what the plant produced last year what kind of produce in  whats the delta look like and do we have enough horsepower to get our leg over the wall on that delta or do we need to do something about it so thats the layer cake analysis that were going through its a fiveyear analysis by plan so were seeing more volume as a result of the build rate increases on bearings were seeing more volume as a result of new bearing product lines that weve introduced over the last five years that are part of the contract that werent part of previous contracts and were seeing more demand from some of the sargent areas because of – the relationship between rbc and the aircraft majors is really beneficial to sargent and so a lot of that sargent product is being endorsed and absorbed by the big aircraft builders so steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc so when you say – sorry go ahead dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer so we have a lot of pots boiling right now steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc yeah no it sounds good the new bearings are they truly new products to you that are engineered into brand new applications are they new product lines to you and youre becoming an alternative supplier dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer theyre both there are new products for the aircraft that are introduced to solve certain technical problems that the existing product lines by the existing suppliers were unable to satisfy and their new products that to us that our existing products to others that weve achieved approvals on and have secured contracts on steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc got it and my last question on the industrial side when youre talking about adding revenue in the low  figure range is that for traditional machinery whether its construction equipment or mining equipment or where are the end markets that youll be serving dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer thats probably going to be in the auto and heavy truck area steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc okay dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer there may be some construction business there and thats substantial too and its too early to tell we have a new product line thats very well tested and endorsed by some of those people but we really havent put any numbers around or contracts around it yet steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc all right thats great detail thanks so much operator and our next question comes from the larry pfeffer of avondale partners lawrence r pfeffer  avondale partners llc good afternoon guys dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning larry lawrence r pfeffer  avondale partners llc good morning so on the gross margin side and i know last quarter you talked about  basis points of improvement for the full year i know its been a long held annual goal how do you look at that playing out over the course of the year i mean obviously some of these are lumpy margin improvement programs but i guess just from a modeling standpoint how would you anticipate gross margins moving over fiscal  dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer well we ended last year at  so our internal target this year is to hit  and its definitely going to be more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year lawrence r pfeffer  avondale partners llc okay and then looking at the aero ramp in the second half of the year how do you think about that in terms of airframe versus engine dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer well i mean its coming from both areas you mean you want a percentage of what how much is airframe how much is engine lawrence r pfeffer  avondale partners llc yeah i guess i was trying to get a feel for the magnitude of increase on both of them in the second half dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i cant say that i know that number id say its biased heavily to airframe though lawrence r pfeffer  avondale partners llc okay and then dan just kind of a housekeeping question what would be the organic revenue growth has been just on the core rbc in the first quarter daniel a bergeron  chief financial officer director  vice president for total sales organic wouldve been around  to about  but its again to that point where when youre merging product lines together these two divisions its hard to get to a good number lawrence r pfeffer  avondale partners llc right daniel a bergeron  chief financial officer director  vice president and you talk on one month here between the two years lawrence r pfeffer  avondale partners llc yeah okay well thanks for questions guys operator our next question comes from the line of sam eisner of goldman sachs nick stuart  goldman sachs  co hey guys this is nick stuart on for sam thanks for taking my questions dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer hey nick nick stuart  goldman sachs  co just piggybacking on that last question can you break out what organic was in the aero and industrial markets for core rbc ex the sargent acquisition daniel a bergeron  chief financial officer director  vice president yeah for total industrial the growth for the quarter was  and classic rbc which is going to be a little while but this is the number were using because we merged some product lines here is down  and sargent is up  nick stuart  goldman sachs  co got it and then on the aerospace side daniel a bergeron  chief financial officer director  vice president on total aerospace its up  and organic is  classic rbc around  and sargent  nick stuart  goldman sachs  co great super and helpful and then dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer once again theres a lot of movement now between plants so nick stuart  goldman sachs  co understand dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer probably not as good a number as we would have given you last year number when  on a quarterly basis nick stuart  goldman sachs  co got it and then i just wanted to dig into the mining comments you made earlier about finding a floor there is that primarily mining oe or mining aftermarket or whats driving the resilience there dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer its mining aftermarket nick stuart  goldman sachs  co got it dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer there is not very much happening on the oe side nick stuart  goldman sachs  co okay and then to – my last question on the oil and gas comments that youve made obviously still a lot of weakness in that end market but have you seen any early indications just given that rig counts have sort of bottomed there potentially increasing sequentially have you seen any improvement in that end market at all dr michael j hartnett  chairman president  chief executive officer no nick stuart  goldman sachs  co got it thats helpful thats it for me thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of david goldsmith of baron capital david goldsmith  baron capital management inc hi guys you called out costs associated with acquisition activity in the quarter can you just frame the pipeline of acquisition opportunities what youre seeing out there thanks daniel a bergeron  chief financial officer director  vice president well we see a continuous flow of acquisition candidates coming from the banking houses that are trying to make their way in the world and so – and we have a little of a flow from some internal sources that we use we dont have anything thats going to close in the next  days but we have – we do have businesses that were active on we are visiting were bidding and were in basically some early stages of that now with things that are in the  million to  million revenue ranges whether it – if we succeed in the bid and whether we succeed in the diligence theres a lot of slips between the cup and lip right david goldsmith  baron capital management inc thanks operator thank you and im showing no further questions in the queue at this time id like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks dr

leader in the precision manufacturing of bearings and highly engineered components for the aerospace and defense industryi started in this plant as a manufacturing engineer he said pointing around at the aircraft products facility in torrington at the time the place belonged to his former employer the torrington co a subsidiary of ingersollrand inc working at his fathers factory was not an option – the business had been unsuccessful and his familys financial constraints meant he had to get a job quicklywhile at the torrington co hartnett earned a phd in applied mechanics from the university of connecticut and built his reputation in the field of tribology – the study of friction eighteen years later he was looking for a changei needed that next step in my career and i didnt see it at

forking out  of his own money the rest was put in by aurora capital group a private equity firm in los angeles which exited in hartnett moved rbc – originally the roller bearing co of america when it was founded in   to connecticut because of the states reputation for a skilled workforce the state was a heartland of the bearings industry in the mids with big players such as trw and skf there were half a dozen plants in torrington alone he said we have employees who worked for every one of those companies rbc currently has about  employees of which  are in connecticut harnetts son and daughter are also in the businesswhen hartnett joined rbc revenue was  million for the fiscal year ending march  net revenue stood at  million rbc went public in august  at  per share and is trading at close to  currently the majority of that growth was driven by acquisitions – more than two dozen to date the company has engineering centers and  plants in the us mexico france switzerland and poland we continue to look to acquire businesses in the us and make at least two to three bids every month hartnett said the most recent acquisition dover corps sargent aerospace  defense for  million is expected to align well with the rest of rbc when we bought sargent it was a  million gross revenue company and  million was spent on purchase materials alone hartnett said rbc made the materials that sargent purchasedthe second quarter adjusted gross profit margin of  percent which includes sargent is among the strongest in the industry however sales of  million and operating profit of  million were below analyst expectationswe have revenue constraints in some of the sargent plants hartnett said when dover was working on selling sargent they got behind now were trying to get them to catch up and they wont be fully caught up until april of next yearseventy percent of the companys sales which accrued from aerospace were offset by weakness in the defense and industrial segments – mining oil and gas there was a mining bubble hartnett said now were seeing a steady state demand for mining products principally driven by the after marketcurrently a half of rbcs revenue is from proprietary designed bearings for which no other supplier is approved in the other  percent of our business we compete on service levels hartnett said providing quality service and building strong business relationships make it difficult for new overseas competitors from asia to compete in the us hartnett saidwe work with a chinese company that has very good technology and manufacturing but they dont know the us market and thats a barrier hartnett said they dont have people on the ground here they dont have the reputation how do they get boeing or ge to talk to them they dont know how to start because their access to the market is undeveloped it takes time and money and thats why they want to partner with usthe company has routinely received supplier of the year awards from boeing co and embraer aircraft despite its strong position rbcs top competitors – rexnord corp minebea co ltd skf ab and new hampshire ball bearings inc – make for a vigorous marketplace hartnett said rbcs orders from united technologies corp for instance amount to  million whereas the companys target is  million despite the highly competitive marketplace the future offers promise according to the freedonia group the global demand for ball roller and plain bearings is projected to rise from  billion to  billion between  and walter liptak an analyst at global hunter securities said rbc is well positioned
