sell a product three methodsshowing enthusiasm for the productconnecting with the buyerselling products as an owner salespersoncommunity qa selling a product doesn’t have to be complicated at its most basic level a sales program is defined principally by what you sell who you sell it to and how you sell it beyond that sales involves staying focused on the details of your product and customers as a sales program continues you will want to keep paying attention to changing trends and the needs or desires of your customers by observing these changes you will be able to adjust your program and keep your sales strong steps method  showing enthusiasm for the product  study your product if you are able to convey knowledge about the product and to answer questions that customers may have then they will understand that you really care about the product if you find the product worthwhile they are more likely to as well it is absolutely vital to know your product inside out if you do not know something a customer asks of you try saying something like “i don’t know the exact answer for that but i’ll be happy to look into it and get back to you right away what’s the best way to contact you when i find the answer”  emphasize the perks of the product to customers as well as getting good product information to the right people it is important to translate the products features into benefits this makes it easier for the customer to see why they should purchase the product think about things like will the product make the customer’s life easier will the product create a sense of luxury is the product something that can be enjoyed by many people is the product something that can be used for a long time  ensure that the product has been adequately explained if you are not doing direct persontoperson sales then you will need to ensure that good product information is supplied via retail packaging pointofpurchase displays and any marketing materials even if you are selling products directly or making a pitch having good product information on display will help you convince customers make sure that all product information is informative true and complete make sure that the language on product packaging and marketing materials is clear direct and easy to read invest the time and money to ensure that your product packaging and marketing materials look good—highquality photos vivid colors etc method  connecting with the buyer  share your love of the product a good salesperson believes in the product that is being sold and transfers this enthusiasm to the customer there are numerous ways to show your love of a product don’t neglect body language and tone you will convey energy and enthusiasm if you speak clearly about a product and show expression when discussing it on the other hand if you mumble when customers ask questions about a product or cross your arms over your chest then it will appear like you are distant and don’t care about the product be prepared to discuss how you use the product or how other satisfied customers have specific stories about the product make it relatable to customers for instance if you’re selling a shampoo you can tell a customer something like “my hair is usually so frizzy but ever since i’ve started using this it’s been as smooth and straight as it is right now”  anticipate your customers’ motivations you want to be able to answer any questions that customers may have about a product but even more importantly you want to anticipate those questions this shows that you understand customer needs make sure that you are able to connect emotionally with customers by addressing those needs think about your typical customers what motivates them what needs do they have are they young single wealthy do they have families once you have an idea of your customers in mind think about how your product can help them meet their needs or reach their desires  practice breaking the ice with customers if you are working in direct sales the way you connect with people is critical instead of asking the closeended question may i help you” ask the more positive openended questions like are you looking for something for yourself or a gift for someone special in addition be ready to make remarks about your product that will interest customers and start deeper conversations for instance if you are in clothing retail you might say “you know ugly christmas sweater parties are really popular right now have you ever been to one”  convert the customers motivations into the products characteristics in marketing this is known as positioning and it consists of equating the product with the customers hopes and desires a number of factors are important when positioning a product position the product in the best spectrum of the market possible don’t pitch the product too high or too low in terms of affordability and luxury position the facts about the product according to the person youre selling it to you may have a handful of different facts but its up to your skill to know which of those facts best serve each individual sale dont fudge facts or lie outright product positioning is about perception not deception position the facts so that they transcend the product itself this means that the desirable positive values associated with the product are what sell it companies that excel at this include cocacola apple and many designer goods or labels think about how your product will connect with a customer’s lifestyle or values and not simply serve a function for instance if you are trying to sell a relatively highend minivan to a wealthy older person you might mention its luxurious features do this by saying things like “take a look at that wood trim—it’s just beautiful and those soft leather seats—they’re so comfortable they’re perfect for taking a nice sunset drive” if you were trying to sell the same minivan to a family with three children however you would emphasize its more utilitarian features for example you could say things like “the third seat adds lots of room for carting friends around it also folds down when you need room for hauling groceries sporting gear and things like that and did i mention that side air bags and antilock brakes come standard”  be honest about your product longterm lovers of your product will only come about if youve been honest with them this means being transparent in your delivery of product information and also admitting your own lack of knowledge or mistakes youve made dont be afraid of honesty it builds trust if you ever are not able to answer customers’ questions or supply them with what they need offer to follow up with them later as soon as you are able to make sure customers know they can come back to you later if they have questions or concerns if it ever turns out that a product isn’t right for a customer be honest about it and help the customer find what he or she really needs even if you don’t make the sale today your honesty and generosity will be remembered and can translate into future sales for instance if you are trying to sell a sports car to customer who eventually tells you that he has five young children who he drives to school everyday you could say something like “well maybe you’d be better off with a good minivan or suv but if you’re ever in the market for a second vehicle come back and talk to me and i’ll help you get a good deal”  close the sale there are many styles and methods of closing a sale but one of the most effective has the mnemonic abc always be closing as you confirm your prospective buyers interest in the product put forward trial closes like does this sound like the product you want or “so what do you think will this meet your needs”  give customers time to consider appearing overly pushy is a turnoff for many buyers they may want to go home and do a quick online search for more information let them do so with your enthusiastic and supportive pitch in mind if youve been truthful helpful considerate and enthusiastic and the information youve given them matches with what they read online they are likely to come back to your product sometimes it pays to let your customers take the lead give them time to consider and keep quiet while they do only offer more information when they request it don’t let customers get away without knowing how to contact you if you are working in a store or on site make sure customers will know how to find you again especially if you will be moving around make sure to tell customers something like ill be right here at the counter if you need me or just ask any sales associate to page me if you have any questions you can also give customers your contact information so they can get in touch with you if they have questions or want more information slip the customer your business card or other contact information and say something call me anytime if you have questions and you can also find me right here in the store on weekdays use your instincts if you think a customer is close to buying stay nearby without being intrusive you’ll want the customer to be able to find you quickly the last thing you want is for a potential buyer to decide to purchase and then be unable to find you method  selling products as an owner salesperson  familiarize yourself with all aspects that feed into the end sale of a

customers experiences that will have the biggest roi for your business register now » we are creatures of habit american families on average buy the same  products over and over again which make up  percent of their household needs according to research out of harvard business school so how can you get people to take a chance on your new business and become loyal customers the trick is helping customers overcome their initial hesitation and making your new item speak to customers in a relatable way here are five ways to help your product sell itself in a crowded marketplace  broadcast your advantage what makes you better than everyone else in the industry be clear with customers from the start perceived advantage is built on factors like greater prestige more convenience superior effectiveness or better value for the money even cleaning products the most mundane of all consumer necessities can win using this theory for example mr clean magic erasers solved the problems that previous sprayon liquid cleaners claimed to with the added advantage of not damaging the paint on walls as competitors products did the brand made this ability to remove touch marks without damaging walls clear through a tv ad campaign that demonstrated the product at work this provided positive reinforcement to consumers before they made their purchase  fit into your customers routine how much effort is required for customers to make the transition from a current product to yours if the cost is more than its relative advantage most people wont try the new product febreze seems like one of those success stories  and it is  but even pg can make mistakes with their branding as was the case with febreze scentstories in  the company launched a  scent player that was reminiscent of a cd player with five scent discs that changed every half hour consumers were confused they couldnt tell if the product played music freshened air or did both not knowing how or why they would use it they didnt  work right out of the box when building new products dont add work for the buyer make your product work as intended the first time out and every time thereafter a kinkfree garden hose for example should be kink free the first time and the hundredth time a childrens toy should be easy to assemble and you should never expect a busy mom to spend more than five minutes figuring out how to use a new slowcooker   make benefits easy to spot the more evident the perceived advantages the more your product will market itself for example the clear plastic packaging of ms command line of removable hooks allows you to see and understand how the product enables you to hang and remove a hook without leaving a hole in the wall  let customers try it out tea bags were first used as giveaways so that people could sample tea without buying large tins vastly improving the trialability of brewed tea and eventually tea bags samples giveaways and store demonstrations are triedandtrue techniques for riskfree experimentation if you cant afford to give your product away offer a tempting discount or buy one get one deal depending on your product and core customer you can use sites like giltcom or travel zoo to make enticing offers local products or services benefit from actual social interaction an informal gathering in a home where guests can play with the product or try the service a farmers or openair market where consumers can touch and taste what youre selling and meet you the easier something is to try the faster customers will want to buy it   debra kaye debra kaye

experienced sellerscommunity qa selling on ebay is a great way to sell or auction off items you no longer need it allows you to reach more people than holding a simple garage sale if you want some tips on how to sell on ebay then this wikihow is for you  second summary  click on sell in my ebay or on the main page  enter a title for your listing  add pictures of your item and a description  set your price and the duration of your auction  doublecheck everything and save steps part  getting started on ebay  explore the site a bit to find ebay simply use your favorite search engine and type in ebay ebay tailors its site to countries all over the world so make sure that you are looking at your countrys ebay site for people in the united states it is wwwebaycom check out ebays seller information pages these pages thoroughly discuss ebays selling policies experiment with ebays search features and browse a few listings knowing how ebays search function works will help you make better listings try changing the search results by changing the options in the sort menu keep a good eye on listings that appear at the top of the search results and those that appear to be receiving many bids  decide on a good account name ebay can provide you with a name but if you come up with an attractive name it can increase the chances of selling avoid anything that is offensive or lowers the value of items you are selling per ebays username policy ebay usernames must have at least two characters and cannot contain symbols such as the at sign ampersand  apostrophe parentheses or lessgreaterthan signs nor can they contain spaces or successive underscores ebay usernames also cannot begin with a hyphen period or underscore ebay does not allow the names of websites or email addresses as user ids nor does it allow anything with the word ebay or the letter e followed by several numbers this avoids abuse by users who want to pose as ebay employees or redirect customers to other less reputable sites via ebay dont use a trademarked name such as a brand unless you are the owner of it names like iselljunk or chickmagnet seem unprofessional and can repel buyers names that are hateful or obscene can be blocked by ebay since so many people are already on ebay spend some time checking that the name you want is actually available and come up with alternatives when your preferred name is already in use you can change your user id later however you can only do this once every  days and if frequently done your repeat customers may be lost  create an ebay account go to ebays main page and look for the sign in link near the top of the page enter your name and a valid email address and choose a password must have  characters and contain at least one letter and one symbol you will be asked to choose a username after you do this ebay will send an email to the address you provided follow the instructions in the email to confirm your account if you have an existing business you can also sign up for a business account on the sign up page click the link at the top of the registration page that says start a business account you will be prompted to enter your business name and some additional contact information  set up your payment method accepted payment methods vary by country in the united states sellers are required to accept paypal or to have a merchant credit card account set up your paypal account following the links from the ebay website or visit wwwpaypalcom check ebays accepted payments policies to find out what is allowed   build your reputation by buying a few small items one important way that ebay maintains itself as a safe marketplace is by encouraging buyers and sellers to leave feedback about each other buyers look at sellers feedback ratings and buying a few items is the quickest way to add positive ratings to your profile try buying small items that you want or need anyway and pay immediately to get good feedback as a buyer dont worry about buying things you can resell the main thing is to establish yourself as a reliable member of the ebay community potential buyers who see a new seller without feedback can be very wary that youre a flybynight seller and they may hesitate to buy from you  set up your profile page its not necessary to have a very elaborate profile if you are just selling small items but adding a picture and some information can help reassure buyers that you are a legitimate seller for selling more expensive items adding more information about yourself is more important especially if you are a new seller people do read these to try to find out more about you so its a good place to explain your credentials such as being a collector a retailer a person with knowledge of particular items etc part  choosing what to sell  sell what you know ebay started out catering to hobbyists and collectors and continues to be a great place to show off your stuff if you are good at finding bargains or rare items in a particular category consider specializing in items that you know a lot about  know what you cant sell obviously illegal and hazardous items like human body parts drugs live animals and illicit services are not allowed other items may be sold but are restricted such as those sold in the adults only category check ebays policies on banned and restricted items to avoid having your account suspended or even permanently banned  minimize risk by selling what you already have or by starting small ebay places selling limits on new sellers typically five items per month if youre not sure what to sell its risky to build up inventory without conducting a few sales first try listing a few small items to get a feel for what sells and the logistics involved you can start by selling things you have around the house that you are no longer using or by picking a few items to experiment with that you can either return or keep for yourself its important to experiment before loading up on too much inventory you may not be able to sell your items at a high enough price to make a profit or you could end up with a lot of extra inventory thats hard to move if you already have some inventory from your existing collections or business youre ready to go making a few sales can help you figure out the best approach to selling your goods on ebay  consider how you will source your items often what you sell is determined by what you can find it can take time and effort to source things for ebay so its important to find a sourcing method that you enjoy and that youre comfortable with ebay itself can be a good place to find bargains some people look for items that are underpriced badly presented or have misspelled titles if you enjoy thrift stores or garage sales this is a great place to start just remember that you usually cant return what you buy so you may end up with items that cannot sell discount warehouse and outlet stores are good places to find bargains and often have a return policy you can take advantage of if your items dont sell  consider how long you will spend listing each item remember you have to take pictures write descriptions and figure out how to ship every single item you sell this takes time so its more efficient to sell similar items and items that are easy to photograph and describe try to find things in bulk or with similar features that way you can create listing templates for yourself or even just create one listing for multiple items look for items that are easy to describe photograph and ship look for items that you can easily ship in the same manner so that you can pack things quickly and get bulk discounts on shipping materials  consider shipping and storage logistics bulky and heavy items can be difficult to make a profit on because they can be expensive to ship and take up a lot of space buyers look at the total cost of the item including shipping so the shipping cost always has to be factored in when considering if an item can be sold at a reasonable price think about space as an important issue working from home selling things can reduce overheads but if your stock starts taking over the space your life wont be the same do you have room for your products and room to wrap pack and store purchased items  consider how quickly you can move your inventory and how long you are willing to wait be aware that trends can pass quickly leaving you with stale stock for other items you might have to wait longer for the collector or other interested buyer to turn up  know whats hot obviously the more popular an item is the more people will be searching and bidding for it this requires a certain knack and often successful sellers are people that intuitively know what will sell however ebay does have some tools for pinpointing what is popular check out ebays hot items page  items commonly listed here include brand name clothing electronics gold jewelry fashion accessories and football shirts look at completed listings this allows you to see how many of a particular item has sold when they were sold and how much they sold for if you have the ebay app on your mobile device this can be particularly useful if youre at a store or garage sale and are unsure about whether to buy something type your query into ebays search box then check the boxes next to sold listings or completed listings in the show only section of the menu on the left of the page for the mobile app enter your search words then tap refine check completed listings or sold items only under search refinement options you can use products built specifically for seller research but youll need to pay for these popsikecom is a free version dedicated for music sellers be aware that if something is popular there will be many sellers selling the very same things as you it can be difficult selling in a category that is already saturated because its so easy to get lost in the sheer number of search results and prices are already so cheap that its nearly impossible to make a profit as a small seller also your low feedback rating puts you at a disadvantage popular items attract scammers who prey on inexperienced sellers who do not know how to protect themselves part  creating listings that sell  research your market search ebay for items like those you want to sell and read the listings especially completed listings which have sold for a good price or current listings that have attracted a lot of bids take note of what sort of information or photos you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer – the same type of information will be helpful to your potential buyers consider what makes you think a seller is trustworthy and how you will manage to convey that same sense of trustworthiness through your sales and profile  log in and go to sell either in my ebay or through the main page at the top  enter a title for your listing the title is the front line in getting your auction noticed a good title will not only give potential buyers enough information to know whether the listing is worth their time to look at it will also attract people searching for your items include all relevant words and spell them correctly insufficient information in a title will attract a far smaller number of potential buyers andor bidders consequently such an item will either not sell or go for a much lower price than it would otherwise keep the words relevant exclude fluff such as cool or excellent you have very little space so use it for what people are searching for nobody is going to be searching ebay for items titled lk or awesome include alternative spellings and phrasings if you have space for example if youre selling an ipod put mp player in your title however ebays search will automatically account for variant phrasings it will also sometimes check category names in addition to the auction title do a search on specific terms and look at the titles of the auctions that come up  take good photographs of your item photographs which clearly illustrate the item to be sold can make a listing bad photographs can actually repel customers get a cheap digital camera or a camera phone if you dont have one already you are required to include at least one photograph with your listing and having more than one photo definitely boosts buyers confidence you can have up to  photos per listing use good lighting where possible turn off your flash and use natural light go outside or take a photo by a window rotate or crop any photos that might need it for a better appearance and use photo editing software or ebays photo editor to improve the picture get as many photographs as your buyers will need take photographs of your item from every angle that you think someone will find useful ebay offers  free photos on each listing get photographs of any unusual feature any defects and so on the extra confidence that this will give buyers is almost always except on the lowestvalued items worthwhile of course some items only need one photo use your judgment here dont use a distracting or dirty background and get rid of any nearby clutter a simple sheet of white paper may be used to provide a clean neutral background for smaller items dont copy photographs from other listings or anywhere else on the internet ever apart from being dishonest and fraudulent this will almost always be copyright infringement nearly everything on the internet and elsewhere is copyrighted whether it has a copyright notice or not see how to take better product photos for free for more ideas on producing good photos for ebay sales  enter a description for your item include any and all relevant information this includes things like the manufacturer compatibility for items intended to be used with something else size weight color condition measurements and so on be careful when adding too much information a buyer can skim through information they do not need to know but will likely hit the back button if they dont see the information they want extra information can also help search engines find your listing put the most important information at or very near the beginning of the listing keep the design simple if you see the need to design a listing at all some sellers clutter their listings with unrelated elements that that it makes the listing itself more difficult to read and display improperly on mobile devices let the pictures and your text speak for themselves choose moderately large easy to read text fonts for your listing and dont overdo animation clashing colors and other distractions remember some buyers have poor eyesight and prefer large print think of large print books as an example of text size be clear about any defects in the item buyers will find this out anyway so let them decide for themselves what is a significant problem and what is not clearly describing an items flaws helps protect you from significantly not as described snad claims however if your item has flaws consider not selling it at all on ebay you dont want to get a reputation for selling junk on negative feedback can seriously hurt or even destroy a small seller  pick a selling format you can choose whichever is convenient for you and best suited to your item the online auction auctions last from  days and can sometimes allow you to get a higher price for your item because it encourages buyers to become competitive with each other and enjoy the thrill of winning an item as much as the item itself this is good when you have something to sell that people frequently search for and seem inclined to fight over such as a rare piece of sports memorabilia the auction format is also useful when youre uncertain as to what price you should sell at and can help you determine the price for similar items in the future buy it now items are fixedprice items they allow the buyer to buy something and have it shipped to them immediately rather than having to wait for the auction to end this is great for items that people either buy routinely or on impulse or for items where the supply already outstrips the demand and where you want to offer a competitive price items which people need immediately are unlikely to attract many bids in an auction  set your price according to how much you paid for the item your time ebay fees and how much it costs to ship remember that once someone buys an item from you or the auction ends it constitutes a binding agreement to sell and it is difficult to get past this unless both parties agree to cancel the sale see how to determine what to price your ebay items for more details you can change the price at any time with fixedprice items or before the first bid is placed for auction items lower starting bids attract more bidders and interest in your item and may well result in your item selling for more but if an item doesnt generate enough interest or isnt visible enough you may get a very low final selling price there is an option to set a reserve price for your item while offering a low starting bid but ebay charges extra for this and some buyers find it annoying dont overcharge for shipping and handling while its sometimes helpful to tweak the shipping price a bit to be able to offer a lower price and account for handling and supplies most buyers will be put off by obviously inflated shipping charges these days buyers expect free shipping and ebay boosts items visibility in the search if they offer free shipping unless your item is particularly heavy increase your opening bid or buyitnow price and offer free shipping keep an eye on the invoices that ebay sends you and be a timely payer you will owe commission fees and other fees over time from listing and you need to make regular full payments in order to be able to continue listing your items for sale while the fees might initially surprise you treat them as very much a part of your business expenses and soon youll remember that these need to come off the costs of your products and efforts  choose when to start and end your auction auctions end     or  days after you start them when the auction ends and how long it lasts can make a difference in how much your item sells for by scheduling your auction to end at a peak buying time you can often get a higher selling price auctions ending on weekends tend to catch high traffic therefore increasing the chances of better end prices for your items many items are also seasonal and so there are better times of the year to be selling these than other times of the year for example beach gear does better in summer while skis will do better in winter you can check out ebays planned promotions for certain categories pagesebaycomsellresourceshtml here check this out and plan your sales for when these categories will be highlighted  keep a friendly tone many sellers seem to go to extra efforts to intimidate potential customers they seem to think its essential to leave scream threats invariably in huge colored fonts to report nonpaying bidders and so on dont do this you wouldnt want to buy from a brickandmortar store wherein the owner watched you every move nor would you want to shop at a store wherein the sales clerk complained about other customers the internet is no different its insulting to your potential buyers to treat them as potential thieves or wrongdoers drop the bad faith approach if you must include additional information on your policies ensure the length is shorter than your item description consider offering a return policy not only does this help you to qualify for discounts on ebay some sellers believe it makes buyers more likely to commit to buy very few buyers actually return their purchases so you are likely to profit more from letting buyers feel secure than to lose money from returns on the other hand the discounts ebay gives to top rated plus sellers who offer discounts is small enough that a single return can cost more than the monthly discount for small sellers if you offer a return policy all buyers are allowed to return everything they buy from you for any reason you can never refuse a return even for buyers remorse if you officially dont offer returns you can still take them on a casebycase basis answer questions from your buyers as the auction runs its course be prompt about it and always be patient clear professional and friendly buyers dont like to see unanswered questions and it impacts your professionalism so dont hesitate to respond  doublecheck everything before saving be sure that when youre done with everything at the end youre at the overview page to double check and press submit if you dont press submit it wont be entered youll then get an email confirming that your product was placed on ebay check your spelling this wont make up for a bad listing in other respects but it still goes some way proper capitalization and punctuation makes listings much easier to read fix any mistakes you can continue to fix mistakes in an auction until the first bid has been placed after which it is what it says part  completing the transaction  watch the auction youll get an idea of interest by watching the counter change and if few people are looking you might need to make adjustments to the auction to make it more appealing to those browsing about the site learn by observing what works and does not work and apply changes as needed  end an auction if needed you have the ability to end an auction up to  hours before its due to end this should be used very sparingly though as watchers may well have been excited about making bids and will be disappointed to see this as habitual keep it for exceptional circumstances such as broken lost or stolen items once you have listed products for sale keep them in a safe place lower the reserve price prior to the last  hours of an auction its possible to lower the reserve price if you find that youre not getting bids keep an eye on buyers it is possible to block some buyers for certain reasons such as buyers who dont have paypal buyers who are in countries you dont ship to and buyers with two or more unpaid item strikes and you can also set up approved buyers lists that automatically allow some buyers to bid  when the item sells and has been paid for be ready to ship promptly  package your items neatly and securely if items are fragile improper packaging can result in broken items and unhappy customers conversely excellent packaging can really improve a buyers impression of the sale  its a good business practice to leave positive feedback for fastpaying customers you can also use it as a promotional opportunity by saying something like thanks for shopping at my ebay store please come back soon part  promoting your listings  if youre selling original art or handmade goods of any kind participate in ebay groups for your product collectors join these groups as often as artistscrafters and many artistscrafters are also buyers some hobbyists sell in order to fund their purchases read threads be pleasant and friendly dont engage in flame wars and compliment anything you like its a good way to make friends and get involved in a thriving niche community  use the power of social networking to promote your listings blog about your listings for example especially if youre an artist or crafter share them on facebook and twitter  include the shipping price in the total price or minimum bid people will look at things that have cheap or free shipping which in turn may make them more inclined to buy  sell inexpensive items to build up your feedback your feedback score is an oftoverlooked component of buying and selling on ebay buyers deciding between identical or near identical listings will usually opt for the one whose seller has a higher feedback rating boosting your feedback rating as a result is very important  after you have become an established seller consider opening a store or shop on ebay this may be attractive if you want people to be able to search via your own distinct url on search engines you want to group sales items together under unique categories of your own making and if you want to build a really interesting profile for your regular and other buyers  finished part  tips from experienced
