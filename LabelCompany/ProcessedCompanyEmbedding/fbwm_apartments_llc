apartment therapy facebook pinterest instagram email search  ikea products every renter should know about  ikea products every renter should know about carrie mcbride mar   renters solutions home share pin it email share email share email image credit ikea two monumental things happened to me in june  my son was born and an ikea opened a mile from my apartment any new yorker whos stood in line in the bowels of port authority to take the shuttle bus back and forth to the elizabeth nj ikea will understand that these events were nearly on par with each other im a lifelong renter and ikea products have come to the rescue for many of my rental conundrums over the years here are in my opinion the most renterfriendly ikea products out there to know about schottis pleated shade  image credit ikea schottis shades are an easy and cheap way to get your windows covered fast theyre great for privacy when youve just moved into a new place or like me youre taking your sweet sweet time deciding on more permanent window coverings the shades attach with an adhesive strip so you dont have to drill into the wall you can cut them to size to fit windows  or less ikea has just come out with a similar shade in blue called sommar pax wardrobe in white with hasvik doors  image credit ikea one of the most challenging renter woes and one ive faced in my last few apartments is the lack of closet space ive lived in apartments with tiny closets as well as one with only a small broom closet but no bedroom closets each time ive ameliorated the problem with pax wardrobes theyre large and highly customizable both in function and look depending on the options you choose they can be expensive so youll want to really think through what you need since the pax wardrobes are so large and heavy id only recommend them if youre planning on staying put a few years check out some of the smaller lighter and cheaper wardrobe options if you tend toward a more transitory life image credit ikea if a pax isnt what youre looking for to solve your small or nocloset situation take a look at the algot system part of the system is wallmounted if youre allowed to screw into your walls and is super customizable — check out the version apartment therapist nancy created in her small nyc studio if you prefer or your landlord prefers something freestanding theres a plethora of frame and basket options the tall ones with hanging options will still need to be secured to the wall but require far fewer holes than wallmounted options but the shorter ones like shown above are truly freestanding new to the  ikea catalog is another closet system called elvarli — slightly more expensive and slightly more attractive in my opinion than the algot — but perhaps not as useful to renters as it must be either secured to the wall or the ceiling but worth checking out if screws in the walls are ok in your rental garnes overthedoor mirror  image credit ikea forget worrying about mounting a fulllength mirror or worse standing on the toilet to try seeing your outfit in the bathroom mirror the garnes hooks over any door and can be taken to your next apartment there is also a shorter version with hooks for  less other renterfriendly options for a fulllength mirror are the standing karmsund or ikornnes floor mirrors or the knapper or isfjorden which also have a hanging bar behind for clothing stugvik series image credit ikea for renters with bare bones bathrooms the stugvik series — intended for use on tile or glass — uses strong suction to attach to walls and can really beef up the storage opportunities in a bathroom with a hanging rail hooks and bins as well as accessories like a mirror soap holder and toilet paper holder similarly the immeln series also uses suction and includes hooks shower baskets and a mirror losjon hangers image credit ikea also with a lot of potential for the bathroom these plastic hangers can be fastened to the wall with screws or renterfriendly selfadhesive tape the colors are on the juvenile side but id love to see someone paint them for a more mature look runnen floor decking  sq ft or  for a wood version image credit ikea runnen floor decking offers an affordable and noskillsrequired option for enhancing outdoor space in a nonpermanent way the plastic tiles snap together to fit your space ive even seen them used indoors in bathrooms and mudrooms decorative stickers    image credit ikea although youll find more selection at other places like etsy ikea has started to offer a small range of removable wall stickers to decorate rental walls without a single nail shown above are the klätta wall collage frames blåvik wall lamp  image credit ikea the blåvik led lamp comes in blue red or white and can be mounted using suction a selfadhesive backing or if its okay with your landlord screws for a few dollars more theres a version with a builtin mirror hemnes coat  hat stand  image credit ikea dont think you cant have an organized entryway if you cant nail hooks into the wall ikea has several standing coat racks my favorite being the powdercoated steel hemnes with hooks on two levels and adjustable feet in case like every rental ive ever lived in your floors are slightly uneven ragrund chair with towel rack  and ragrund sink shelves  image credit ikea renters with a pedestal sink especially with exposed plumbing may lament a lack of undersink storage if this is you — try two ragrund sink shelves pushed together to fit around your plumbing and voila instant storage if you have space for a chair the ragrund chairs high back serves as a towel rack — one less screw in the wall another holeless towel rack solution is the standing grundtal towel rack ranarp spotlight  image credit ikea rentals are notorious for having poor or harsh overhead lighting floor and table lamps can go a long way to remedy this but a sconcelike lamp like the ranarp is handy to have in your arsenal too it can attach to the wall with screws or used wherever you like when clamped onto a surface another clampon lighting option is the smaller jansjö perfect as an accent light for showcasing art or books
