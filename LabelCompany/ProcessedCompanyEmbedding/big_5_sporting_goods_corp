log in     sunnyvale saratoga rdsunnyvale ca    needed to get a tent for an upcoming camping trip did some research online and found a tent that i liked on big s website called the store to see if they had it in stock and they did sean grabbed it and kept it by the front desk a half hour later i showed up and bought the tent didnt even have to walk past the cashiers desk sean was super friendly and helpful the customer service was horrible except for anthony who was helpful in answering questions thanks anthony upon arrival the woman at the register didnt catch her name but she was tall heavyset and never smiled didnt acknowledge us we had to roam around the messy store to find someone who could help us find an allterrain wagon finally anthony was able to help us he was the only helpful person in the store upon checkout the cashier just did the basics rung our items totaled us out handed the receipt no did you find everything ok or thank you have a great day while in the parking lot we took our wagon out of the box and noticed there was dirt on the wheels so it was clearly used we returned to the store to let the unfriendly cashier know and she looked at us dumbfounded then called the manager over the manager norahad a similar attitude as the cashier but was even worse by giving us attitude there was no apology for selling us a used item or having to come back to the store to return it they didnt have another item in stock and nora basically had a take it or leave it attitude we had already spent nearly an hour in the store waiting for someone to help us and dealing with a used item plus we had plans for the day so i told her well take the used one if we can get it discounted nora seemed irritated bc we already used a coupon and it seemed that we inconvenienced her by asking to receive a discount on their used item that they sold to us she literally said you guys already used a coupon ok ill just give you  off but its final sale theres a difference between leadership and management this store clearly has no leadership or direction they also lack any ounce of customer service no wonder their reviews are so negative seriously the worst customer service ive ever experienced in my life wish that were an exaggeration when i walk in i was greeted gloomily by someone at the main entrance she didnt ask me if i needed help so i just kept walking i go straight to the shoes nobody is around i try to look for soccer cleats and they are nowhere to be found i walk back to the clearly unhappy with her job cashier to as for assistance to her response go back there and nothing else no please no ill call someone just a minute i go back to footwear and no one is still around i wait for a couple minutes and all i can hear is a bunch of employees behind the employees only door horsing around and cursing really loudly someone finally comes out looking confused i asked him for some cleats and he looks at me and says we probably dont have those i guess in an attempt to not have to go to the back and search for them i just left this was the worst experience ive ever had id be happy to speak to a manager about this tldr  dont come here after work on a weekday nobody is around and nobody wants to help you my partner and i came inside with  in cash ready to buy a kayak and other equipment and i needed to use the restroom facilities so i asked excuse me sir where are the restroom facilities he says no public bathroom in a very rude tone so my partner says shes about to spend good deal of money here the least you can do is let her use the restroom their selection was also quite terrible and most kayaks lacked price tags and the employees couldnt be bothered to help these guys lost a customer first thing you notice about this big  is that its a pretty basicjenky looking store in the middle of a jenky looking parking lot all things considered though this place is always great for deals and quantity i came here recently to check out good bargains on camelbaks and hydration packs and i noticed that this big  had everything i was looking for in stock thats a huge plus especially when places are always out of items business is pretty slow here and so you might not see many customers or even employees however if you catch one he or she will probably help you out gladly tldr this is a decent store to buy your sporting goods and outdoor activity gear its not the nicest looking shop but it has what you need shop well and prosper overpriced sporting goods i spent over  on little league pants socks  belts for two kids i had to hunt someone down to find things because their store has really small signs they could organize their store better or put bigger signs of categories also the guy who worked the cashier stand wasnt very friendly and seemed distracted there isnt too many sporting goods stores now a days so i am limited they also seem to have a lot more team apparel than anything else so warrior fans plenty of gear here since they closed the sports authority in sunnyvale we have to shop at this store now and it is very disappointing  customer service is awful as if the people working their do not want to be there or be bothered in our recent visit to this store we were not approached by any of the staff and when i finally asked for help the staff member answered very rudely and walked away  this store is disappointing overall minimal sports items no variety what so ever and horrible customer service the selections here are huge you could literally find anything for great deals not much womens shoes though i found sweat pants for under  the store is well organized and dont miss their clearance section clothes equipments and shoes this place was a dump and filthy went to try and buy shoes stuff was thrown all over nothing where it should be and a big mess looked like a decent size store but could not bring myself to walk around it since i need a tetanus shot this store really needs to improve the customer service especially the manager he gave a very bad attitude to me today because i asked him to help me to find an exchange for the not working helicopter i bought in this store on thanksgiving day i dont feel he try to help customers at all and he doesnt care either i will never step into this store this is a tuckedaway store on sunnyvalesaratoga and el camino in sunnyvale its definitely not a supersporting store but they have a lot of merchandise and clothing the store sometimes has sections that are in disarray or being rotated with signagepricing stacked up on displays when ive been here being that the store is already jampacked full of stuff it can look a bit unruly in areas like some of the others have written the shoes keep some of us coming back i look though the clothing and the shoes when im here for deals staff is nice very helpful theyll leave you to your shopping but if you have a question theyre not hard to locate big lot one side of its not too busy so parking is easypeasy horrible staff and manager called over the phone to have staff check for life vests and i was told they dont have any i went in the store anyways to check for myself and the first thing i saw hanging was life vests exactly the one i wanted i told the manager and she did not care at all i work across the street and i will def make sure none of my friends go here tim in the shoe section not only helped us find the perfect pair of shoes for my husband and i but he found the ones that we needed on sale excellent customer service so very helpful in finding the exact shoes that we need we will be shopping here from this point on i have made three visits to this store in the last month all three have been to make ammunition and gun cleaning kit purchases in the firearm department the city of sunnyvale requires fingerprinting for simple ammunition purchases so that already in and of itself creates a tense strange privacy encroachment situation that and their overpriced ammo i was willing to let slide for the convenient location however there is a thinmoustached dude that works in the firearms deptartment there who has an annoyingly condescending and judgemental attitude that is frankly pissing me off on my third and last visit there he seemed to be bothered andor had a weird badcop unfriendly and confrontational attitude hey ive had it i am simply not going to ever shop there any more and deal with his egotistical condescending and suspicious raising bullshit period im taking my business some place else you all need to remember that you need good customer service skills in order to attract repeat customers and run a succesful business having jerks like these as salesmen is not helping you have a good life guys decent selection horrible customer service big store clothes all over needs to be cleaned up this is a good store to find quality sneakers when your teens outgrow them every two months but search for sales and dont pay full price find the  off coupon online and print it before you go in just type in bigfivesportinggoodscoupons the weekly coupons only pertain to either cyber purchases or sales of that week sometimes they have bins of shoes on sale which is worth checking out expect to pay  on good sneakers join their mailing list and keep up with upcoming sales i am very pleased with the customer service i received while looking for new walking shoes i recently sold my car and now walk just about everywhere i went through three shoe returns to find the shoes that were perfect for me i chose two different styles of asics and they are so comfortable but i really want to give shout outs to mike tim sandra omar and gino for all of their professional assistance and patience with my questions and shoe returns i definitely would refer friends to this store and for a very good reason a happy customer  not even worth the trip the clothing selection was terrible there was basically nothing even worth looking at and an even more abysmal sale i was looking for nike pro shorts nortsyes this is a thing to add to my recently started collection what big  is actually good for maybe

though they were sold out of his size in a particular running shoe the employee had located his size at the big five on blossom hill and that hed called and asked that location to hold the shoes for

in     el camino realmenlo park ca    weve always had good luck shopping here finding needed items at great prices and even getting competent customer service parking is easy the cashiers friendly and the overall shopping experience is greater than at must discount stores but less than at nordstrom i guess things have changed last time i bought an airsoft gun there was about  years ago and it was a pretty normal experience i went to buy a gun today and felt like i was  years old again the sales guy that helped me was clueless and slightly arrogant will find another place to buy my toys awful just awful this white small guy trying to act tuff ask me if i was from around their lol wtf that have to do with be buying shoes so i bought a pair of coleman lagoon sandals late last year and never wore them until this june yes i know i should have known better it turns out that they were worse than a piece of junk  after wearing them about five times the footbed padding had compressed so badly that the plastic rim ended up cutting my heels and no im not overweight the left one was cut so deeply that it bled and got inflamed the day before leaving for a vacation lucky i guess because i was going to bring those sandals after i got back from my vacation i tried to return them if youve read previous reviews you can guess that the manager was less than interested and less than polite needless to say i still have both the scar on my heel and the sandals i cant wear them and i dont want to give them away even though theyre barely worn note to self do not buy cheap sandals or at least do not buy them at big  two stars for some cheap stuff if you must buy it there just be totally absolutely sure that it fits and doesnt injure you and dont buy coleman lagoon sandals anywhere ever ive been to big sporting places and small buying winter stuff summer shoes ammunition gym clothes and so much more  and i somehow always seem to find it  this big  store i went there one time on a lark my glasses kept running down the bridge of my nose and i was looking for those band  not really sure what to call them etc etc one i talked to to clerk and viola truly horrible service from the management i wanted to get a replacement for shoes i received as a gift for sizing i was told that i could get a replacement by a few workers these associates let me try a bunch of shoes out and were very polite i was going to check out and was being rung up by a manager he proceeded to tell me that i had to pay an extra  to replace the shoes i was taken back by this because i was told otherwise by the other workers when he saw my response he started nagging me about not having a receipt he tried to look something up got distracted by something else then went back to me after a few minutes to nag me some more its a horrible customer service practice to nag your customers especially when you dont know their circumstances like the fact that i received these as gifts and dont even bother to explain your exchange policy i didnt experience any rudeness at another store which is good because i know that there are other big  stores that wont treat me like a disappointing soninlaw it doesnt look like much from the outside but this little store has it all we have bought countless sports shoes usually marked down knee pads balls athletic wear ski clothes ball pumps camping gear you name it we probably go in there once a month on average and someone at the front always greets us and instantly directs us to the location of our item there is always a good selection more than one brandtype to choose from and we walk out with what we need so refreshing after walking aimlessly around sports authority where no one makes eye contact with you and the racks have limited sizescolors i was fumbling through a rack looking for shorts in my size saw the girl at the counter look at me then look back down thanks for nothing after walking past her i realized she had been doing her homework so she didnt have time to help me or acknowledge me wont be returning just like the big  close to home this store has great service and a nice selection of running shoes they always have good sales too i found a nice pair of new balance trail runners for   bargain hubby bought two pairs of shoes and a couple of trinkets easy parking too the management at this big  knows how to handle customer service i have grown up with this store and somehow they are able to keep up with my changing needs a great store and a great team they have a lot of stuff that is the nicest think i can say prob ok if you know exactly what you wantnot ok if you need any helpadvice and if you dont need helpadvice than i dont know why you are not just shopping online in the first place very few associates to help the associate i could find did not know how childrens shoe sizing worked did not seem very confident in helping me fit a  yr old there were no loaner socks to try and when i asked that he bring a few diff brands for us to try he brought one  i am almost certain the most expensive not on sale one we left without buying shoes  no one noticed that sums it up extraordinary selection with constant sales of heavilydiscounted items i routinely find excellent deals on shoes sleeping bags etc customer service is generally very good you may occasionally have to hunt for an employee but they are very helpful otherwise good store representing a great company this place was really good to me  i needed to buy  soccer balls as the prize for the winners of my soccer camp and they were so nice i couldnt carry them all and the manager helped me up to the register as we as out to my car thanks guys i really appreciate it  i really like this place it doesnt seem like as many people go here as some of the other busier big s like say the one on stevens creek which means that when there are sales there is always more selectionsurplus here then some of the other stores oops maybe i shouldnt have said that but its the truth so there you have it  stars for  absolutely amazing friendly service  the most unbelievably cheap sporting goods ever coming to big  you have to set your expectations straight this is no rei so you wont be seeing every variety of every product on their shelves no road bike gloves and shorts no world cup  official fifa soccer balls what you will find are unbeatable prices for basic running and hiking shoes great prices on assorted goggles and tennis rackets even cheaper than those on sale at sports authority tons of brand name athletic clothes on sale among other things like bocce balls while this location isnt as big as some others they are one of the friendliest big  is the trader joes of sporting good stores love it i just had the worst customer service experience here unfortunately i had to enter this establishment and will not be returning if i need any of the odd items this store carries i will now be taking my business online even though i am a true shop local person i can not continue to support a business with no pulse im not a sportytype so i havent needed to come in that many times both visits for something particular were successful in part due to good service i just bought new shoes for kickboxing my running shoes werent cutting it and i got some advice from the fitness instructor a sales associate quickly asked if i needed help and when i explained my problem he said the same thing that my instructor did answers my questions well and quickly got me the shoes i was interested in he was also helping other customers during this time when i was done he pointed out where the socks were if i was interested last year i went in for softball mitts i had to seek out an employee who was helping many other customers too but was able to get good help on choosing a mitt they had some great sales and im very happy with what i bought the store itself is relatively dingyold and doesnt have a huge selection for any one item since they carry so much in a different less connoisseur area this place would seem great but if you expect a palo alto or menlo park type of store you might be disappointed i love this place all the employees are very nice and helpful never had a bad experience here and iv been going here since i was a baby to buy shoes and sporting equipment unlike target they actually have a boxingmartial arts section and for me its the most convenient sporting goods store this area seems kind of light on them surprisingly the prices are fair at least for what i bought  for lady boxing handwraps this would be my first stop for any sort of sports equipment or apparel my dh purchased a ladder golf corn hole set approx  month ago the product cost was  after very little use stored outside but in a covered patio the thing fell apart i went to the store with the intention of alerting their buyer that the product was of poor qualitythat they ought to stop selling it i did not have a receipt and was not expecting a refund as i was in line an older gentleman behind the counter yelled at me if you dont have a receipt we cant do anything for you it was incredibly rude i tried to tell him that i only wanted to show them how bad the product and that they shouldnt sell it he would not let me get a word in and just kept repeating that if i dont have receipt he cant do anything ugh it was such a poor customer

log in     walnut stredwood city ca    i dont know what it is about the big  newspaper ad that compels me to read it  i rarely shop there but theres something about that ad that draws my attention like a tractor beam its not the biggest sporting goods store on earth  if youre looking to go clothes shopping id go elsewhere but when your kids need cleats helmets mitts etc theyve got you covered with pretty reasonable prices too ive been back here for more stuff which went pretty good but today i was getting a little piss listening to this asian lady in the front being snappy at a customer if the sale from the previous week is over take the damn tags down its not the customers fault you didnt do your job i dont know if the asian lady is a manager or not but someone needs to have a talk with her about acting like one this lady is pissing off people who want to spend their money there if it wasnt for my kids really wanting this thing i bought i wouldve walked out  i want to feel welcome at a store not come to find someone with a bitchy attitude i was in a hurry to pick up a pair of running shoes and steven was friendly and courteous with assisting me in getting the right shoes at the register i had a few more questions and the store manager was willing to stop what he was doing and help i appreciate the quality of service and felt compelled to write this review good service deserves recognition i used to work nearby and the storefront was along the path i would take when i needed to take a short walk to stretch my legs and i would duck in there and look around if my schedule permitted the staff was always friendly and were willing to help and answer my dumb questions about store policies and coupons the managers rotate from one store to another and are still are able to keep track of your face and pick up conversations from where you left off three weeks ago i was overwhelmed from the moment i walked in this store is extremely disorganized and messy looked at some sweaters and not only is their selection sparse but found many items with defects broken zippers thread coming loose etc shoes all over the place and barely any room to walk i saw one employee and he looked very stressedoverwhelmed i remember this store being way more organized and pleasant when i was younger will not be returning good place and great sales picked up a bike helmet on sale and a frisbee no problem with service the place is a little small need more inventory i never particularly like shoes from big  so i stay away from these id rather spend more money on comfort and durability they have a clearance section for athletic wear although i think ross has better deals lots of room for parking overall good service great prices this place is just okay honestly i go here to kill time when the family is at kohls next door the staff is friendly i can usually get at least two people to acknowledge me but it is a super small store and id be offended if no one asked me if i needed assistance or at the very least say hello went in againshould have known better looked around for some crabbing gear didnt see any then asked the cashier she was knowledgeable and was aware that there were none in stock however she walked with me over to the fishing section and physically confirmed they were out of stock what this tells me is that they are aware they are out of stock and likely several people have asked for them and they have made no attempt to order more i think theyre a great go to for your kids better quality gear than kmart or walmart staffs always helpful i go there for jump ropes theyve a good selection the great thing about big  is they are all over relatively speaking and it seems whoever was hoarding all the ammo has slowed down their roll if my local big  is out a particular caliber a nearby store may have it in stock most times they even call for me isnt that nice a far as the rest of the store goes they have a pretty good selection of various sporting goods despite the small size of the store face it you are never going to confuse this place with a cabelas or bass pro all in all the folks who run this store do it very well i am always greeted at the door and i appreciate the job that adam does managing the store i pretty much despise big  but ill give them an extra star for providing a decent choice of family tents for excellent prices i picked up a coleman person tent here for only  well lend it out for others who have school trips and to everyone we know and it may be trashed in a couple of years but thats ok for this price otherwise this big  is not an impressive place it has a very small store footprint small selection and terrible service i got zero help other than someone pointing in the general direction of the camping section the tent prices were unmarked and the lazy counter dude didnt have a clue so he made me lug the damn thing all the way up front so he could scan it good thing i scored on my first try disastrous experience here had a defective bat that i tried to return  twice  and was blown off  twice the two managers i spoke to told me they would follow up and showed me the door actually first they offered my  year old and i an opportunity to wait at the gun counter no thanks i wont be shopping here again doug was the sales guy to help me and he was awesome i was asking for snow gear and its not out yet instead of telling me its not in stock he goes and brings out boxes and got me everything i needed and asked for he was great  would come back again very small store poorly organized no clear signs open boxes in aisles with no one around small riflegunshop area but no one behind the counter to help prices are not anything special even on the clearance rack same complex as kohl toys r us and babies r us will go somewhere else for my sporting gear this is a really good big  they reminded me of my email coupons and scanned it from my phone i needed some stuff that was totally hard to reach and they were jumping to help me everyone was on point taking care of business had to review because i dont get the two stars really bad customer service from the assistant manager brandon would not recommend this place horrible service with the exception of the nice older gentleman everyone else is rude and refuses to help there is never enough people staffing the store and even when i do find someone to ask a question they dont know the answer they dont know their own products big  is a great store they always have great weekly sales and you can always find decent athletic shoes at fantastic prices this big  is next to kohls in the part of the shopping center that faces the freeway bad servicemy advice to big  managers is learn california laws when it comes to selling firearms i walked in the store with my fiancé asked to see a shotgun store manager handed it to me i looked at it passed it on to my fiancé asked her if she liked itshe says yes so then i told manager we will take it manager asked who was gonna do paper work i said she was he then denied us both the sale its not illegal for my girlfriend to have someone go along with her to purchase a firearm or to ask for his opinion after denied sale like that we felt like criminals we went to another big  in san mateo and they were notified that we may be going their next and were also denied they really maid me upset big  did not stop us from getting what we wanted ohh we got it but never again will we attempt to buy firearms from big   learn youre california laws really managers sitting around chatting and laughing at some i am sure sorry story me and poor register guy waiting for him to say yes my  bill is real i ask the kid at the register if i should just walk the bill up to him he responded i wish you could top off the whole thing manager grabs bill from kid looks and then throws it on top of the register no respect for the guy working the register who must

events talk log in     stevens creek blvdsan jose ca    ive been coming to big  since i was a lil kid always had a good experience decent pricing friendly staff and always loved there gun section hehe great athletic equipment also i came here with my fsc and all documents on hand ready to purchase a rifle the store didnt seem busy and i was greeted at the front register i walk directly to the firearm area and looked for a few rifles i wanted to take a look at after spending about  minutes browsing as i waited for someone to come by and help me i decided to leave the store empty handed i was disappointed that no one ever came by to ask if i needed any help even though i noticed employees walking from the front to the back of the store multiple times clearly i could have went off to seek for help but isnt it a standard to check up on customers every few minutes i felt like they wanted to avoid helping customers and just get through their shift with doing as little work as possible sadly i dont think id come back to this store again this is my go to place when i need sporting supplies fast and at a decent price i would give it  stars but most the time the help their doesnt really want to give you the time of day if you know what youre looking for run in and get and run out customer service sucks at this location young crew that just stand out in the front and talk smack about other coworkers no greet or help very displeased especially at this location  am selection here is decent and prices are competitive its one of the few places i can get firearm supplies outside of bass pro we were just looking for hand warmers when we walked in they welcomed us to the store we asked the employees and they located them for us quickly they were friendly and helpful what more could we ask for checkout was fast stevens creek has the best and friendliest people we shopped there recently before a camping trip and previously for soccer equipment good prices and decent selection for such a small store i hope it outlasts all the construction in the area we really like this place unbelievably worst experience ive ever had at a sporting goods store the manager austin told me he could not get my pingpong table i wanted to buy because he was the only manager and couldnt leave the store to go in the back and get it even though there were other employees present i dont know how someone walks into a store wanting to spend  and is told im sorry i cant help you absolutely incredible have to add one more for no customer service we went in needing to buy bats and bat bags while we shopped our daughter needed to use the bathroom we were told it was through a back door in the shop we stood at the locked bathroom door thinking someone must inside an employee was there with her feet kicked up looking at her phone she knew we were there and said nothing i finally walked out and my husband took her to use the bathroom he asked the employee if there was a key to get in and she ignored him  times they were in a very small space she could hear him he finally raised his voice higher than he needed to and she said the key was at the front he

while on a bike ride we decided to stop here and check out some items but there was no bike rack outside to lock up our bikes is it just me or should a sporting good store have a bike rack i like big  i find their prices comparable to other stores in the area and they do have great email coupons dont ride your bike here if your looking for name brand cheap shoes come here just understand what you see is what you get there is no overstock great place to find camping stuff sporting goods and guns my son and husband and son can spend shours here and still not want to leave they have some really good sales on tents sometimes and lounge chairs i know you dont know me but trust me do yourself a big favor and dont go here unless if you want to ruin your day love the weekly shoe sales they offer ive bought many pair of sneakers here over the years we need to get some sleeping bag for our kids for our relay for life event which was coming up very soon i seen in an ad that they were on sale here at big  i know i have gotten some great deals in the past so decided to give big  another try to my surprise the lady at the counter as we entered was very friendly and helpful so we took a look around and asked her if somebody can meet us within the sleep bag or camping section she call and right away somebody was there to help us we found exactly what we were looking for and went to pay for it after a quick stop at the racquetball area for my  year old to get something to throw at home lol we were in and out within  minutes without anybody trying to sell us something we did not need but instead of something we asked for and they were more than helpful to get for us we are looking forward to our next trip here and get more supplies for our next event or camping trip received awesome customer service by maria and a very polite gentleman sorry do not recall his name they went above and beyond with a can do attitude this store did not have the coleman instant shelter canopy i wanted but maria made sure i left happy by calling other stores to locate one for me she had them put it on hold with my name on it campbell big  pulled it and had my name on it ready for me as i walked in the door both store employees on on the ball and i appreciate that thank you maria and the rest of the gang who helped me out i told her i was going to yelp herhere it is ladykeep doing what your doing horrible customer service i had the worst experience here and i am still kicking myself for making my purchase and not just walking out i stopped by to purchase a pair of swimming goggles simple enough i walk up to the cashier with my goggles and said hello the cashier let out the biggest exhale and groan yes she was multitasking and i didnt mean to interrupt but what was i suppose to do the cashier never looked up never acknowledge my greeting and the only words spoken was  ironically the st time i had been to a big  was about a year ago when i was purchasing nonetheless wait for it swimming goggles since then i considered myself a regular shopper purchasing camping equipment clothing and the random airhorn sorry big  but i am going back to rei and sports basement if you value your time dont come here what a terrible customer service experience coming to this big  was what was supposed to be and in and out trip turned into a  minute wait we came for a sleeping bag found the one we were looking for in  minutes they dont have them boxed up ready to grab  you need a sales associate to get you one from the back okay thats not a big deal wrong its not a big deal if it doesnt take you  minutes just to track someone down then wait  mins for them to come to you then another  mins for them to bring you said item thats exactly what happened when we went on a non busy afternoon i really wanted to walk out after  mins of waiting but my patient husband made us stick around after waiting  mins my husband heard a sales associated go to someone by the shoe dept and ask if they needed help  he went over and said a manager had said someone would be with us next the guy looked confused the manager heard and apologized to my husband and told his employee that we were indeed next as we had been waiting for a while had my husband not overheard him going to another customer we may have had to wait  mins ridiculous i hated the fact that we gave them our business and will never go back for anything overall i like big sporting goods i have bought a number of items over the years hiking boots sunglasses swim suits and goggles snow gear camping gear watches etc i would recommend the store for the value of the item they sell and they actually most of the time have items that i like and fit for a good price especially so when on sale in general these stores are of smaller size and fun for me to visit they tend to be a little messy but cozy still i have found items that i was not able to find at bigger store such as sport basement i read several complaints about the staff i did not have problems with it on my visits but did not have many questions for them either or expect that they would know everything about they items they sell in the store one more big plus is their multiple locations in the bay and their website that list their products and can help getting research done before visiting the store too their ad format is nice as well happy shopping  i was at this store and i saw a man who i think is the manager being extremely rude to one of his sales clerks being very loud and in front of a lot of customers it seemed very disrespectful and inappropriate to be doing in front of customers i dont know if i will be coming back here so one star for prices nothing more i came in looking for shoes after a short search i came up with a couple possibilities i scan the floor for a salesman just to catch the only employee i see kicking open the stockroom door and disappearing behind it being fully aware he could be assisting another customer i wait my turn after a ten minute wait i catch a young lady heading back into the same room i ask her if anyone is working in the shoe department she tells me shell get someone for me and disappears also a few minutes later she comes back out and walks away i catch her and ask her if she found someone to help me i tell her nobody has assisted me still she goes into the stockroom only to immediately run back out ducking and dodging me to run to the front where i find her chatting with another employee again i follow her and ask if i can please get some help she waves her hand toward the shoe department and informs me theres like three people over there with a big huff theres still nobody in the department so at this point the assistant manager patrick i believe walks over and i am not embellishing asks every customer in the department except me hovering near the stockroom door if they need help and proceeds to walk back to the front obviously at this point i was tired of standing around holding shoe displays and being ignored so i dropped the shoes and left not too quickly to overhear the manager complaining to another associate that the customers really need to start

log in     w campbell avecampbell ca    hmm im bit perplexed by the really bad reviews with respect to customer service maybe management has cleaned up since the bad reviews nonetheless ive been here on multiple occasions being the gym rat that i am and am in the process of turning my garage into a home gym ive bought rubber mats dumbbells and other things in the past there was one time in which i didnt have the receipt for a return but the items were not opened and they had no problem with me exchanging it to the people who are complaining on returning opened items well it must suck even if its only been a day or two but most retail stores in general will not make an exception on opened products thats just the way it goes big  has always had good prices and they often mail me discount coupons ex  off  bucks off orders more than  etc cant beat that a smaller big  branch one thing i always appreciate about big  is their super cheap prices for brand names like adidas nike and under armour with that said i came in looking for kneepads they had a selection of volleyball kneepads and i was able to find what i was looking for after searching around the store the merchandise layout is a little confusing and some directional signage would be incredibly helpful for customers navigating the store customer service could have been better no one asked me if i needed help even though i spend several minutes actively looking until approached a staff member the cashier was pretty curt too this is a smaller big  but i kind of like that because its easier to get in and out quickly and is still has everything i need i came in to buy hiking boots and there was enough selection and the workers were really nice and helpful they were able to give advice on different types of hiking boots and the benefits of each upon checkout i was next in line with one other person behind me and they were nice enough to open another cash register for me im giving a  star due to the awesome customer service i had in case management reads its cashier  who you should thank normally when i return and cant find my receipt bad habit i get such a look and given grief she was patient and asked if o knew when how much etc i was able to pull the info up and thankful as it was just above  she went to the back and was able to pull the receipt and give me a full refund she could have said no rolled her eyes given me a hard time but didnt i commend her and will be more than happy to shop here in future due to her customer service note i was able to pull up my back info to show date amount and card i understand without this this could have been a different situation but since i was she was able to assist my kids just started basketball camp this week and we needed a new ball for the backyard hoop admittedly i usually buy online but was in the plaza for other shopping needs so decided to drop in the store manager austin was extremely patient and helpful dude is very knowledgeable and we spent several minutes discussing the best basketball option for my kids ill certainly reconsider buying online as my first thought and will definitely be stopping by big  first next time thanks austin i went in looking for pink soccer cleats they didnt have any but i found the cutest pink nike shin guards and pink adidas socks then after shopping around everywhere big  was the last store in my list and found everything needed exempt my shoes david and eddie helped me out they are the reason im giving them  stars i was very grateful they helped me out i will defiantly be coming back for more soccer supplies was in the area and needed to replace my nike duffle bag while in the store i was overlooking the shoe section when i observed an employee continuously disrespecting another employee who was actually working and trying to clean up the area he just kept trying to instigate and pry at the employee clean upwork on the shoe area the shit talking employee was not doing shit pushing his way in front of the other employee to help customers it was like watching a bad episode of high school bullying the shit talker looked like a low self esteem meth head avoid this store if they cant take care of their own employees what makes you think they can take care of you trust me they wont horrible experience and wont be backever plenty of better places to buy things with non bullying workcustomer environments stopped by to check out some duffel bags asked a sales person if there were other colors available and he became rude and condescending saying they are all the same and starting tossing bags towards me even though they werent the right size the store manager apologized for the others guys rudeness when i complained so much for trying to support our local stores i left without purchasing the bag i dont think i will be returning anytime soon based on the other reviews it does not look like big  is going to change their customer service policy anytime soon just walked in  manager and  associates no hello or offer to ask for help decided id make my purchase elsewhere warning the return policy here sucks they dont allow returns on anything that has been opened at all yesterday i came to this store to look for some free weights they didnt really have any small ones for women they had some weights but they werent what i was looking for the closest thing that they had to a light fee weight was this as seen on tv shaker that was so light there was no way that thing would ever get me toned at all on the plus side there is a decent selection of other items such as stuff for tennis sports apparel for men women and kids basketball camping stuff shoes and more the issue with finding free weights wasnt the main problem though i settled on almost buying this strange looking pilates thing that comes with two ropes attached to the base that claimed it was good for toning everything as well loosing inches i also almost bought a pilates mat to go with it anyways i was skeptical buying the pilates contraption thing since it looked like something that i might end up getting tangled in or something like that so i asked the cashier what their return policy is and if i could return it for a refund if i dont like it she then told me no but then when i said sorry i dont want it anymore she said that i can bring it back if its still in selling condition i almost bought it then but then the manager of the store happened to be in the area and he overheard most of everything i think that she asked him about their policy too and he said that it cant be returned if its been opened so i almost ended up wasting almost  on that product alone im so glad that i asked about their return policy i dont like stores that have this kind of policy i think thats to strict and a huge inconvenience to customers i wont be coming back there again the worst customer service ever we walked in looking for a specific sized pop up canopy and the  lazy cashiers told us to walk into the back employees only room and find one ourselves what when we decided on which one we wanted  brett our cashier was so irritated that we had the nerve to even ask for a carry out really will not be shopping here ever again please fix your customer service big  its lacking today i went in on my lunch about pm to look at firearms that were on sale i was greeted with an unenthusiastic hello from the cashier i went over to the firearms department and waited for any sort of associate to appear another gentlemen joined me and after about  minutes of waiting had better sense than i to cut his losses there and find a new store while leaning over the counter to get a better look at prices i had an older man who i can only assume was in a managerial role force his way buy me open the employee door and quickly retreat into a back room which out so much as a hello or how can i help you or any even marginal attempt at customer service i will never go here again and from other reviews from people looking to purchase firearms neither should you they have a decent selection of a variety of just enough items to find a median quality version of whatever youre looking for the coupons sent to you are a motivatir at times to shopand selective sales items are a deal at times ive been here  timesthe only draw back is they typically are under staffed and you will wait for help and to check out so give yourself some extra time to shop so i need a new pair of running shoes and since my son also wanted a new pair of skater shoes i came to our neighborhood big  now mind you i live about  blocks away and actually frequent this particular store due to my  year olds never ending need for new shoes so i walk in after a bit of shopping at nob hill and an appointment at ewc and am greeted by a really sweet female cashier i go to the shoe section and find a pair of my sons usual skater shoes and begin to check out the running shoes the whole time there are not  but  guys working in the shoe department now im the only customer there as of this time so of course im expecting some level of customer service ummmm no greeting no eye contact no anything total avoidance is what i received now i dont think im at all intimidating at  but perhaps im wrong as i continue to stand and test the flexibility of the shoes an elderly woman of another persuasion comes and begins to look at the shoes next to meso please tell me why both of the sales associates greet her and ask if they can be of assistance really now i know for a fact that i dont look to be impoverished nor do i look as if i am just a window shopper so what gives anyway the younger of the two assists her while the balding gentleman continues to straighten the shoe display on the wall mind you they were already straight so i take it upon myself to greet him and ever so kindly ask him to retrieve  pairs of shoes from the back he does so with a sigh whatever basically the only reason im giving  stars is because of the great customer service and the  discount i received from the cashier i wish i had asked her name big  has all the usual stuff a sporting goods store should have today i stopped by to pick up some paper bbs i use them in my bb handgun to shoot targets the store is very nice and staff waited on me efficiently try it out lots of other stores around here also limited supply of air guns large supply of different kinds of ammo im writing to let you know how disappointed i am with the customer service quality given by the management at the big  sporting goods at  w campbell ave campbell ca  i came there seeking to purchase a firearm and was handled with disrespect and a lack of quality in customer service both encounters with management had the ability to process firearms the first encounter with a manager on duty a woman on  night shift was rude and had a demeanor that she did not want to help me or be there she was also rude in answering questions this poor customer service made me come back another day to purchase the firearm the second encounter was today older man  morning shift was also rude as he gave off a demeanor that he was not interested in helping me he also wasnt careful with the firearm as i watched him hit the rails when placing it back i understand that the firearm shotgun will attain such cosmetic wear but he had no regard in keeping my firearm from further damage as i was processing my dros he was rude and it felt that i was hassling in doing the process by this time i became upset and decided to take my id away from him and do my business elsewhere this lack of customer service will deter me from this store and not recommend it to anyone in the best interest of your company please retrain them in quality customer service i just want everyone to know to stay leery from this one i know this may be my first review but keep in mind it isnt my first time with customer service hope this helps the service at this big  in campbell is hit or miss meaning that it can be good here and there but other times it isnt normally i dont stop in the store unless i really need something it has the usual assortment of sporting goods that any other similar retailer should have prices may be okay but like the service it can be hit or miss though sometimes they may run sales on select items this stores return policy inspires me to spend my money at one of the other big s next time around picked up a pair of reeboks here wore them for two days got a blister did a thorough job cleaning them up but the manager wouldnt give a refund because you can already see the crease near the toes i know its less than optimal but sheesh isnt that going a bit overboard especially considering i was returning it for what is arguably a defect the menlo park and sunnyvale big s just to name two are far more generous the rankandfile staff here are quite cool though i bought my son a lr rifle here for his birthday the manager was fairly well educated on guns the buying process and everything involved it was relatively simple of a process however the front staff could be trained better on how to deal with pickups and purchasing firearms i walked into this big  a while back and have never been back being somewhat of a fitness noob i heard about kettlebells as a good fitness tool i walked into big  hoping someone could help me find one there were three employees hanging around the front when i walked in i asked them if they had any kettlebells they all looked at me like i was an alien one guy said do you meankettleweights and i hadnt necessarily heard that term in reference to the kettlebells so i shrugged and said yes i suppose he looked baffled making me feel like an idiot he walked me over to the weights and there were several boxes every single one of the brands said kettlebells not one said kettleweights i then turned around to walk out and said to the remaining guys up front that all of the boxes said kettlebells and left terrible unfriendly service and i havent been back since big  sporting goods unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed by the owner or a

lots of other stores around here also  limited supply of air guns  large supply of different kinds of ammo was this review … useful  funny  cool  mitch s campbell ca  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow mitch s stop following mitch s  im writing to let you know how disappointed i am with the customer service quality given by the management at the big  sporting goods at  w campbell ave campbell ca   i came there seeking to purchase a firearm and was handled with disrespect and a lack of quality in customer service both encounters with management had the ability to process firearms  the first encounter with a manager on duty a woman on  night shift was rude and had a demeanor that she did not want to help me or be there she was also rude in answering questions  this poor customer service made me come back another day to purchase the firearm the second encounter was today older man  morning shift was also rude as he gave off a demeanor that he was not interested in helping me he also wasnt careful with the firearm as i watched him hit the rails when placing it back  i understand that the firearm shotgun will attain such cosmetic wear but he had no regard in keeping my firearm from further damage  as i was processing my dros he was rude and it felt that i was hassling in doing the process by this time i became upset and decided to take my id away from him and do my business elsewhere this lack of customer service will deter me from this store and not recommend it to anyone  in the best interest of your company please retrain them in quality customer service i just want everyone to know to stay leery from this one  i know this may be my first review but keep in mind it isnt my first time with customer service hope this helps was this review … useful  funny  cool paul n honolulu hi  friends  reviews  photos elite ’ share review embed review compliment send message follow paul n stop following paul n  the service

my money at one of the other big s next time aroundpicked up a pair of reeboks here wore them for two days got a blister  did a thorough job cleaning them up but the manager wouldnt give a refund because you can already see the crease near the toes  i know its less than optimal but sheesh isnt that going a bit overboard especially considering i was returning it for what is arguably a defect  the menlo park and sunnyvale big s just to name two are far more generousthe rankandfile staff here are quite cool though was this review … useful funny  cool nick v san jose ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow nick v stop following nick v  i bought my son a lr rifle here for his birthday  the manager was fairly well educated on guns the buying process and everything involved  it was relatively simple of a process  however the front staff could be trained better on how to deal with pickups and purchasing firearms was this review … useful

reference to the kettlebells so i shrugged and said yes i suppose  he looked baffled making me feel like an idiothe walked me over to the weights and there were several boxes every single one of the
