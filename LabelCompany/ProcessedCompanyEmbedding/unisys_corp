products inc email  print  comments  no  view case cited cases citing case  fd   unisys corporation plaintiff appellee v dataware products inc and william j cunningham defendants appellants united states court of appeals first circuit heard may   decided june   attorneys appearing for the case robert s potters with whom ladonna j hatton and potters  sands pc boston mass were on brief for defendants appellants william n berkowitz with whom william a mccormack sarah m morison and bingham dana  gould boston mass were on brief for plaintiff appellee before coffin bownes and torruella circuit judges coffin circuit judge this appeal challenges both the capacity of the district court to issue and its discretion in issuing preliminary relief in a suit brought against dataware products inc dpi a successor corporation to dataware sources inc dsi a company involved in chapter  bankruptcy proceedings the case arose from the following circumstances in late  dsi became a nonexclusive distributor of computer hardware and software products for unisys corporation unisys successor to the burroughs corporation dsi is a massachusetts corporation as difficulties accumulated together with increasing indebtedness on the part of dsi to unisys the distributorship was terminated in july of  immediately thereafter according to the allegations of the complaint dsi its president cunningham and its treasurer vahey engaged in a conspiracy to defraud unisys by liquidating the assets of dsi and transferring them at sacrifice prices to customers or its successor corporation a lease and a line of credit in the name of dsi was transferred to dpi dpi received and obtained payments of receivables owed to dsi dpi reported to customers that it was an authorized distributor of unisys in september  the successor corporation dpi was formed with cunningham the sole stockholder suit was brought by unisys against dsi in michigan in  in march  judgment was obtained in may  on the day when cunningham was to be deposed in connection with attempts to enforce the michigan judgment dsi filed a petition in bankruptcy under chapter  the present suit by unisys against the successor corporation dpi was brought in october of  the theories of the suit are the following in count i unisys sought a declaratory judgment that dpi is the alter ego of dsi and liable to unisys on the latters judgment against dsi count ii alleged fraudulent conveyance and a conspiracy to defraud by means of transferring dsi assets to dpi and others while insolvent count iii invoked massgenl c a sanctions for dsis alleged deceptive acts count iv alleged unfair competition in the making of false representations that dpi was an authorized distributor of unisys in november  a hearing was held before the district court and evidence taken on unisyss motion for preliminary relief the court found that there was a spectre of fraud in the circumstances surrounding the founding of dpi and that one may draw an inference that the second corporation was created for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff unisys it also concluded that unisys would probably be able to establish the personal liability of cunningham finding it likely that unisys could establish a fraudulent scheme with significant participation by cunningham the court granted unisyss request for an attachment of cunninghams property the court reasoned as follows unisys may recover a sum in excess of  plus attorneys fees perhaps much more the property sought to be attached is located in westwood massachusetts and was bought about ten years ago for a sum in the vicinity of  it has no doubt appreciated in value but it is also encumbered to the extent of  dpis assets are insufficient to satisfy a potential judgment here being worth something in the vicinity of  hence they would be insufficient to satisfy a potential judgment mr cunninghams interest in the westwood property should be available to satisfy at least a portion of the remainder of the judgment the court thereupon issued a memorandum and order on application for preliminary injunctive relief and for an attachment it granted preliminary relief  enjoining dpi and its two officers cunningham and vahey from transferring any assets or stock other than in the ordinary course of business  requiring dpi to file an audited balance sheet with the clerk of the court and subsequently an accounting of corporate transactions every ninety days  ordering a writ of attachment to issue on real estate of cunningham and  enjoining dpi and cunningham from representing themselves as being affiliated with unisys on january   subsequent to the proceedings below the trustee in bankruptcy of dsi filed a notice of intention to abandon property of inconsequential value to the estate the property was described as including a few items of furniture nine computers and supplies trade accounts receivable of dsi and any claims of dsi against dpi cunningham or vahey arising out of the facts as alleged in a suit by unisys corporation against dpi cunningham and vahey objections later to be more particularly noted were filed by dsi and overruled by the bankruptcy judge on march   the first issue is whether the district court had jurisdiction to entertain unisyss request for preliminary relief dsi contends that the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code  usc § a deprives the district court of subject matter jurisdiction under counts i and ii this section states that a petition in bankruptcy operates as a stay of  any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or property from the estate it cites in re mortgageamerica  fd  th cir in that case the plaintiff obtained a judgment against mortgage america in state court and shortly thereafter filed another suit against the controlling officer alleging that he deliberately stripped the company of assets almost immediately the company went into bankruptcy the court ultimately held that the automatic stay of §  prevented the plaintiff from pursuing the companys officer since the causes of action were property of the companys estate as the court elaborated the automatic stay gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors and forestalls a race of diligence by creditors for the debtors assets id at  quotations and citations omitted moreover the strong arm provision of the current code  usc §  allows the bankruptcy trustee to step into the shoes of a creditor for the purpose of asserting causes of action under state fraudulent conveyance acts for the benefit of all creditors not just those who win a race to judgment id at  we find mortgageamerica inapposite the property sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the instant case was present assets of dpi there was no suggestion that substantial physical assets from dsi of any value remained more importantly unisys was the only creditor the only other possible claimant being a former stockholder of dsi and the trustee for the dsi estate in bankruptcy had specifically obtained permission to abandon any causes of action that dsi might have had against dpi or cunningham in fact dsi upon filing an objection to the trustees intended actions of abandonment in the bankruptcy court acknowledged that the trustee is the proper party plaintiff and the only party plaintiff to pursue claims of the debtor against its officers and directors and third parties for alleged fraudulent conveyence breach of fiduciary duty and other causes of action one can hardly imagine cunningham asserting a right on behalf of the debtor dsi to sue himself and his corporation for a fraud he helped perpetrate in the particular circumstances of this case we find anomalous dsis argument that even though the only person or entity other than unisys able to assert a right of action against dpi and cunningham for defrauding dsi — the trustee — has now given up that right the right nevertheless reverts to the debtor collier states abandonment constitutes a divesture of all interests in property that were property of the estate although section  does not specify to whom property is abandoned property may be abandoned to any party with a possessory interest in it citation to house and senate reports  collier on bankruptcy ¶  l king ed  it is clear to us that the right of action to sue dpi and its principal officers once abandonment by the trustee took place reposed in unisys free of any stay we therefore hold that the district court properly took jurisdiction of this matter this brings us to the merits of the decision of the district court in granting preliminary relief unisys argues that the relief given below was merely that of equitable attachment and that the requirements of fedrcivp  of a showing of irreparable injury and favorable balance of harms was not necessary unisys relies on anderson foreign motors v new england toyota  fsupp   dmass however it seems to us that the present case falls more in the mold of teradyne inc v mostek corp  fd  st cir in which we sustained a preliminary injunction restraining the transfer of assets in order to protect the damages remedy we think that the order was treated by the district court as including injunctive relief and that the combined requirements of filing an audited balance sheet submitting reports of financial transactions and confining stock transfers to the ordinary course of business were more than minimally coercive id at  and thus as in teradyne amounted to an injunction nevertheless even applying the requirements of planned parenthood league v bellotti  fd   st cir we think the necessary requirements have been met as to the pronouncements of the district court on the likelihood of success of the claims of unisys concerning conspiracy and fraud we have reviewed the record and cannot say that the district court committed either an abuse of discretion or an error of law even though the district court made no finding in haec verba regarding the irreparable harm that unisys would suffer absent relief we think the record amply indicates in the portion of the courts opinion that we have quoted that the measures taken were necessary to assure the presence of an adequate legal remedy see mesa petroleum co v cities service co  fd   n  th cir by the same token we feel that our own case of teradyne inc v mostek corp supra supports the courts action there has been a sufficient showing of irreparable harm to unisys as well as a balance of harms in favor of unisys see  fd   in short we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting preliminary relief affirmed comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit or
