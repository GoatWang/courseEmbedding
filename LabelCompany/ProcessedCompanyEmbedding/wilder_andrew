pft gear tickets buccaneers sign p andrew wilder posted by mike wilkening on march    pm edt apthe buccaneers have added a third punter to their offseason roster announcing a deal with andrew wilder on friday wilder  was not in the nfl in  a northern arizona product wilder joins chase tenpenny and michael koenen on the bucs’ punting depth chart it’s not unusual for clubs to carry an extra punter in the offseason and in training camp but three punters is uncommon koenen the buccaneers’ incumbent at the position is set to make  million in salary in each of the next two seasons and such compensation is relatively high for his position however koenen is an experienced presence at a position where clubs can be loathe to tolerate youthful mistakes and he has long blunted opposing return games with only of career punts returned share thisshare on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on twitter opens in new windowclick to share on tumblr opens in new windowclick to share on

expects to be ready for week one responses to “buccaneers sign p andrew wilder” rslibertarian says mar    pm this guy can really punt the ball with is foot i know a lot of people are down on the bucks but this is a great steal looks like belichick missed this value guy stillabucsfan says mar    pm thus why we suck luckgoat says mar    pm  punters lol bucs jerichox says mar    pm i know not to many people watched bucs games last year but koenen was highly unreliable last year coming off an injury the year before tampa also was laughed at when they cut conner barth and found a rookie in patrick murray to take over kicking duties at over  million a year for a punter that was highly inconsistent last year it is fully understandable that the bucs are looking to replace him id be surprised if koenen is on the team next year liner says mar    pm koenen makes more than most because he’s also a very effective kickoff specialists or at least he was he was an awful punter last year and ordinary on kickoffs i’d be shocked if he’s a buc in  dobe says mar    pm wow just wow that’s so lovie classiefreddieblassie says mar    pm they better find a good punter because he is going to get a lot of work next season with the potential of a rookie qb working behind an oline i could get a starting job on “ and out” is going to be a term tampa fans are going to hear a lot oldsombrero says mar    pm championship stevesmakal says mar    am people need to realize koenen is so over payed at a position which the bucs have used a lot of because they could never move the ball on offense they are looking at a possible franchise qb with the first overall pick in winston where they can nove the ball with three legitimate  ft plus recievers and tight end they can afford this move to find a suitable replacement for a third of the price great move with no risk stop hating on lovie and the staff they know more about football operations than the common blogger gobucs tampatwo says mar    am i remember reading that koenen was coached to punt for hang time last season yd average… instead of his normal near yd avg of course this could have been the company line if that’s the case yes save a

experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship

you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off
