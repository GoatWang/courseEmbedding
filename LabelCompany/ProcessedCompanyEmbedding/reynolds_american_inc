africanamericans to appeal to blacks seeking a less pronounced menthol taste similar to lorillards newport which was gaining share reynolds decided against using green on the packaging and instead used black and gold the colors of luxury european cigarettes narrowing the marketing further uptown cigarettes were to be packed with filters facing down the reverse of the usual arrangement  market research indicated that many blacks open packs from the bottom possibly to avoid crushing the filters it was later discovered that cigarette packs were opened from the bottom for a different reason this phenomenon traces back at least to world war ii when cigarettes were a valued commodity among soldiers often a soldier temporarily without cigarettes and without funds would bum a smoke from a fellow soldier it was impolite to refuse such a request however there were two occasions when a refusal was not considered impolite if there was only one cigarette left in the pack and if the pack was not yet opened a pack opened from the bottom and resting as it normally did in a shirt pocket would appear unopened therefore the soldier in possession of cigarettes would be able to avoid having to give too many away the promotional blitz was scheduled to begin on feb  and philadelphia was selected as the test market because of its large black population before it began the campaign came under

maintained that joes smooth character was meant only to appeal to adult smokers this criticism was reinforced by a  study published in the journal of the american medical association  showing that more children  and  years old could recognize joe camel than could recognize mickey mouse or fred flintstone coincidentally fred flintstone was also once used to sell rj reynolds winston cigarettes and alleged that the joe camel advertisement campaign was targeting children despite rj reynolds contention that the campaign had been researched only among adults and was directed only at the smokers

africanamericans to appeal to blacks seeking a less pronounced menthol taste similar to lorillards newport which was gaining share reynolds decided against using green on the packaging and instead used black and gold the colors of luxury european cigarettes narrowing the marketing further uptown cigarettes were to be packed with filters facing down the reverse of the usual arrangement  market research indicated that many blacks open packs from the bottom possibly to avoid crushing the filters it was later discovered that cigarette packs were opened from the bottom for a different reason this phenomenon traces back at least to world war ii when cigarettes were a valued commodity among soldiers often a soldier temporarily without cigarettes and without funds would bum a smoke from a fellow soldier it was impolite to refuse such a request however there were two occasions when a refusal was not considered impolite if there was only one cigarette left in the pack and if the pack was not yet opened a pack opened from the bottom and resting as it normally did in a shirt pocket would appear unopened therefore the soldier in possession of cigarettes would be able to avoid having to give too many away the promotional blitz was scheduled to begin on feb  and philadelphia was selected as the test market because of its large black population before it began the campaign came under
