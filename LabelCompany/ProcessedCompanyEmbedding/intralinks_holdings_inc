objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

corporation has grown to  properties and  guest rooms the company has relied on strategic transactions to fuel its growth and support its financial performance since its  ipo on the nyse  situation red lion hotels regularly evaluates acquisition and divestiture opportunities in the past sensitive financial and legal documents related to these transactions sometimes had to be scanned and emailed – an exercise that was timeconsuming and inefficient if files were too large to be emailed red lion would upload them to dropbox or physically mail them on a usb flash drive each of these options presented real security concerns and did little to help streamline or organize the process solution red lion’s strategic counsel decided to try intralinks intralinks is an advanced vdr that gives deal professionals – buyers sellers and advisors – the ability to easily and instantly share sensitive documents digitally with both external and internal parties while maintaining physical control and ensuring the security of all information at red lion this meant that participants in the deal process could also conveniently access information without suffering through the delays introduced by physically shipping materials around or having emails with large file attachments blocked by firewalls in addition deal participants were instantly and automatically informed when new information was added to intralinks which helped keep all parties engaged  as a member of the legal department for red lion julie langenheim director corporate services legal  asset management was charged with
