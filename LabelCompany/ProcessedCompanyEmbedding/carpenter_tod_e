president and chief executive officer and scott robinson chief financial officer this morning tod and scott will recap our third quarter performance the drivers of our increased guidance for fiscal  and provide an update on some of our strategic initiatives during todays call we may reference nongaap metrics such as adjusted earnings per share you can find a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap metrics within the schedules attached to this mornings press release also for reference this morning we posted a schedule on our investor relations website showing the yearoveryear sales change with and without the impact from currency translation i want to remind everyone that any forwardlooking statements made during this call are subject to risks and uncertainties the most important of which are described in our press release and sec filings now ill turn the call over to tod carpenter tod tod e carpenter thanks brad good morning everyone i want to begin by welcoming the hypro employees and their valued customers to donaldson company with their focus on stationary applications hypro is a strong complement to donaldsons mobile hydraulic business our two companies leverage product innovation and worldclass customer support to solve complex filtration problems were looking forward to combining our global footprint and technology with their application expertise to accelerate growth in the strategically important liquid business i also want to thank our donaldson employees worldwide for their contribution to our strong results they are doing an excellent job addressing demand and meeting our customers needs at the same time they are pressing forward on our strategic initiatives further strengthening our foundation for continued success i sincerely appreciate their hard work and commitment turning now to a recap of our performance we had another strong quarter on the top and bottom lines driven primarily by the engine segment we anticipate recent trends to continue so we increased our fullyear forecast for sales operating margins and earnings in total we see fiscal  sales up approximately  and adjusted eps up more than  scott will cover our guidance in a few minutes but first ill share some third quarter sales highlights total sales increased  with engine up  and industrial down  compared with recent trends our engine firstfit businesses performed very well last quarter in offroad sales grew  to  million representing the highest volume in  quarters a portion of this increase is due to an easy comparison from last year but there are a couple of other noteworthy drivers one factor is a mix benefit from the type of equipment being produced the largest mine haul truck for example have somewhere around x the dollar content of an overtheroad truck given that dynamic even a modest increase in production can accelerate our sales in addition to this mix impact we are also seeing benefits from our past program wins we have a strong win rate in both air and liquid and the firstfit fuel wins are almost all incremental to our business while the volume in firstfit fuel is still relatively small our select fuel offering which leverages our innovative synteq xp media grew more than  last quarter we saw a slight increase in onroad last quarter driven entirely by growth in the us while it appears this market is stabilizing its worth pointing out that third quarter last year was the lowest volume quarter that we had in almost six years the stability were seeing in our engine firstfit business is complemented by continued strength in sales of replacement parts total aftermarket sales were up  in the quarter and thats on top of  growth in the same quarter last year once again the strength in aftermarket was broadbased we had yearoveryear growth in all major regions and both channels additionally partmo added about  million to the top line and contributed to the  increase we saw in our latin america aftermarket sales sales in our aftermarket oe channel were up in the highsingle digits last quarter we had growth in both on and offroad products and sales of powercore were up in the low teens based on what we are hearing from our customers and seeing in our data the demand appears to be more about pullthrough than restocking however its tough to tell and were closely monitoring week to week ordering patterns in our independent aftermarket channel sales were up in the low teens our lube and fuel business was up in the low  range driven largely by the shortcycle program wins we have had in recent years we are also benefiting from increased activity in the mining and oil and gas industries sales to customers with exposure to the energy sector are up meaningfully driven by the higher amount of content required for setting up and operating these sites rounding out the engine segment aerospace and defense sales were up  last quarter reflecting growth in both commercial aerospace and defense while our engine businesses seem to be on firmer footing we still have some variability within our industrial segment total sales in this segment were down  driven entirely by gts the gas turbine market continues to be challenged by customer delays low demand for new projects and aggressive competition consequently sales into large turbine systems are below our forecast and last year we are confident that this market has value over the long term so we will continue to be selective in how we bid large turbine projects while pursuing growth in sales of replacement parts our industrial filtration solutions business is also facing soft firstfit demand the modest increase last quarter in ifs reflected a highsingledigit increase in sales of replacement parts that was offset by a commensurate decline in project sales on a positive side quoting activity in ifs continues to pick up in most geographies while orders are still slow to develop some of this pressure is being mitigated with our innovative product offerings such as lifetec filters for the food and beverage industry pleated bags that replace traditional baghouse filters and downflo evolution downflo evolution brings the razor to sell razor blade model into dust collection and it is being very well received by customers sales of this equipment were up more than  last quarter and we continue to gain traction outside the us in asiapacific where we launched about a year and a half ago sales were up  in special applications all the businesses contributed to the  increase but sales of disk drive filters were the biggest driver the growth in disk drives appears to be more of a temporary shift as hard disk drive storage is getting a shortterm benefit from challenges related to the availability of solid state storage that said for years we have been working on increasing share with major customers and getting extra content per drive the benefits from these efforts were magnified last quarter when the market headwinds moderated but we expect that pressure will resume in the near future ill now turn the call over to scott for a discussion of our third quarter results and outlook scott j robinson thanks tod good morning everyone as tod said we had another strong quarter ill briefly touch on the highlights and then ill cover the details of our increased sales and profit outlook third quarter total sales were up  or  in local currency total operating margin increased to  from  last year net earnings were up  and gaap eps grew to  from  in  as a reminder our prior year results included pretax restructuring charges of  million excluding the impact from restructuring in the prior year results third quarter  eps was up  and operating margin was up  basis points reflecting higher gross margin and expense leverage there were several moving pieces in our gross margin which was up  basis points on an adjusted basis we captured some benefits from cost reduction initiatives but higher than expected demand is creating a variety of incremental costs like premium freight and overtime in our plants the expense leverage last quarter was primarily driven by sales volume but the benefit was partially offset by higher incentive compensation our other income went down by  million with the difference attributable to a swing from a gain on foreign exchange last year to a loss this year our third quarter tax rate increased to  from  last year discrete benefits in the prior year accounted for nearly all the increase in terms of cash management we feel good about our working capital in light of the higher demand the increase in receivables and inventory levels contributed to the cash conversion rate that was below  but not out of line with where we expected it to be meeting our customers needs is always a priority and the increases were in line with the momentum in the business finally we returned  million to our shareholders last quarter through dividends and share repurchase which included buying back another  of our outstanding shares once again we are pleased with the solid third quarter results and we anticipate a strong finish to the fiscal year we raised our fiscal  sales forecast to plus  reflecting yearoveryear growth of  to  in engine combined with a decline of  to  in industrial compared with the midpoint of prior guidance our total sales forecast went up about  or  million all that increase is attributable to engine which includes an incremental benefit of  million from the acquisition of hypro the negative impact from currency translation also moderated over the third quarter resulting in a fullyear impact thats less than  point on total sales in engine the forecast came up for all businesses the strongest yearoveryear growth is coming from offroad and aftermarket which are both expected to be up in the low teens while the growth in offroad is encouraging our fullyear forecast puts us at about twothirds of the peak volume and it is still below where we were just two years ago the aftermarket forecast is a different story and very positive story based on growth of innovative products our geographic diversification and roughly  million of inorganic contribution from recent acquisitions we are forecasting aftermarket sales to be at a recordsetting level this year sales of onroad products are expected to be down in the low doubledigit range which is better than our prior forecast because of increased stability in north america lastly in engine we expect fullyear ad sales to be up in the midsingle digits a modest increase from prior guidance as we finetune the forecast our industrial sales guidance came down slightly driven by gts based on a strategic shift we made last year market conditions and competitive dynamics we now see gts sales decline in a  range we expect sales of special applications will be down low singledigits or as we are forecasting ifs sales up in the low singledigits we also raised the midpoint of our operating margin forecast by  basis points we now expect to deliver a margin of  to  the sales leverage on our fixed expenses is giving us some tailwind but pressures from a handful of items including the cost associated with meeting higher than expected demand and incentive compensation moderate the incremental gains based on the midpoint of our guidance the implied incremental margin for fy  is in the low  range reflecting an incremental rate of  in the first half and about  in the back half as a reminder the first half rate was driven up by a couple of factors with the most notable being a very easy comparison from the prior year additionally the faster than expected sales pickup in the second quarter gave us extra leverage as our associated expenses lag demand we feel that the back half rate is more typical of what wed expect over the longterm of course the incremental rate will vary from quarter to quarter and by fiscal year and its largely dependent on whats happening with the sales and our level of investment back into the company tod will provide an update on some of our strategic investments in a few minutes so let me hit on a few of the other metrics in our fiscal  guidance we expect a tax rate of  to  and our other income is now forecast between  million and  million we still see capex between  million and  million but we revised our cash conversion guidance down to  to  to account for the increased working capital needs we are still planning to repurchase between  and  of our outstanding shares this year altogether we now expect adjusted eps between  and  the midpoint of this range is  above last years adjusted eps and  of the midpoint of our prior guidance range as a reminder gaap eps includes a benefit of  from an escrow settlement in the first quarter so fullyear gaap results will be above adjusted eps by that amount in addition to tightening up our fy  forecast we are in early stages of planning fiscal  given the recent momentum we thought it would be helpful to share some of the items we are contemplating in the process i forewarn you that im going to keep my discussion and any answers to your questions at a high level well provide a detailed outlook when we release our fourth quarter earnings in a few months starting with sales our analysis of the engine end markets which is influenced by trends in our business thirdparty data and external customer forecasts suggest the recent stabilization should continue through at least this calendar year should that hold true its likely that both production and equipment utilization will be up in our fy  the degree of the increase will vary based on several factors including the type of equipment the geography where its being used or produced and the impact from used equipment already in the field above all economic conditions will drive the performance the outlook in our industrial markets is cloudier but forecast for durable goods manufacturing is positive and pmi has been trending over  for nearly a year what we have yet to see is a meaningful shift in global capex spending that stimulates project growth so we will be closely watching trends over the coming months we still have a lot of work to do on profit projections but i wanted to share a few of the items we are contemplating in our plan there are a handful of tailwinds for fy  operating margin including a lower incentive comp as we reset the annual bonus plans and some relief from the incremental cost associated with higherthanexpected demand we expect a portion of these benefits will be offset by salesdriving and technologyrelated investment its too soon to comment on the net effect these puts and takes will have on next years operating margin but we will be disciplined in our investments and our longterm commitment is to generate incremental profit on increasing sales we will also maintain a keen focus on our balance sheet next year i am pleased with the progress we made and i am confident in our employees ability to keep driving improvement as we continue to leverage our global erp and centralized key functions our cautious approach to planning this year left us in an excellent position to capture margin while minimizing the risk of reactionary costcutting we will take a similar approach next year to ensure we are investing for growth and generating the best returns on our invested capital with that ill turn the call back to tod tod tod e carpenter thanks scott we are encouraged by the stability in the engine end markets but the variability between our segments remind us that we are still in a mixed operating environment as we look forward we expect the recovery to be choppy especially in our industrial segment so we will plan cautiously at the same time we are making strategic investments in salesdriving initiatives expanding our technology portfolio and strengthening our infrastructure the most obvious investment to drive nearterm growth is adding sales staff to the businesses where we can grow firstfit andor replacement part sales additionally we are seeking to accelerate growth in some of our newer product offering such as venting solutions and the lifetec filters for the food and beverage industry we also began building an ecommerce platform this year we are complete with the design phase and our into the application build phase we expect to launch next fiscal year in select businesses this platform will make it even easier to engage with donaldson for new and existing customers in terms of our technology we will scale up our rd investment we have historically spent between  and  of sales and we expect to increase that to somewhere between  and  over the coming years we want to further widen our technology gap by developing bestinclass media innovative form factors and new filtration processes another technology focus is connectivity end users are looking for more ways to efficiently manage their equipment and we believe donaldson can play an important role in their quest we are very early in this process but one tactic to drive this strategy is leveraging our acquisition last year of epc and their filter minder brand this company brought a wellknown brand and it had a strong focus on sensors and indicators so we made it a center of excellence for our engine business we will look for ways to integrate this technology into the filtration solution as we believe our customers would value that option finally we are planning to strengthen our infrastructure for future growth by making peoplerelated and capacity investments in terms of our people we will begin work on a global hr system much like the business case for our global erp project we are confident that a single tool and consistent approach will advance us towards our goal of being a worldclass employer additionally we are looking to expand our production infrastructure by adding capacity to certain product lines with a particular focus on our innovative offerings like powercore and liquid every one of these broad priorities and the tactics associated with them supports our strategic objectives we will leverage our technology to drive firstfit revenue that drives sales of aftermarket products we will continue to focus on diversification both in terms of end markets and geographies and we will actively manage our ma pipeline to identify engage and acquire companies that help us accelerate the progress on our strategic objectives weve been executing on all of these tactics during the downturn and the recent stabilization gives us an opportunity to accelerate plans in certain areas we will maintain the disciplined approach we have applied for years so i want to clearly state that we are not expecting to take a step backwards in terms of operating margin as scott said we expect to deliver incremental profit on growing sales our goal is to selffund these investments by prioritizing our expenses and redirecting a portion of that incremental profit we expect to generate im confident that these actions are necessary and appropriate as we further strengthen our foundation for the longterm success of our company now ill turn the call back to tashan to open the line for questions tashan questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of george godfrey with cl king your line is open george godfrey really nice revenue growth and total revenue coming in over  million i would have thought the gross margin would have been just a tad higher on such a strong performance on the top line could you talk about the firstfit products or specific platforms perhaps that are pressuring the gross margin on such a strong revenue number scott j robinson sure this is scott i can take that so in terms of gross margin i wouldnt say it was related to any one particular product category as we said there was some gross margin pressures with the accelerated demand we had a little bump in overtime costs as well as freight and we also had a tough comp from last year so those couple of factors i would say is what drove probably the point that you are thinking about george godfrey got it and then just a followup this morning deere announced they are buying wirtgen group for about  billion and focusing more on construction do you have relationship with that company and if so is it meaningful or does the deere open up that door tod e carpenter this is tod we do have a relationship with them they are a customer of ours and we enjoy a nice position the deere relationship really just further strengthens between the two companies what we already enjoy with both of them george godfrey got it thank you for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of charlie brady with suntrust robinson humphrey your line is open charles brady just on the erp system thats essentially done from what i understand can you just talk a little bit about kind of leveraging that as you go through youve spent the past few years three or four years engaged in that in a pretty heavy way and now its kind of essentially behind you with some small blocking and tackling but how do you leverage that going forward i think in the past youve talked about some opportunities but maybe just a little more granular on where you can take that and what that can mean to margins over say a two or three year period scott j robinson sure this is scott so yes weve talked about our erp implementation quite a bit we spent four years and approximately  million on that implementation to convert the company to oracle r our last conversion was completed on the first day of this fiscal year so that brings the company onto a single platform and we feel that we have a long runway of opportunity to have better information to manage global processes to standardize processes and to be able to leverage that into a stronger performance of the company so we are on a long journey of creating centers of excellence and standardizing our processes to both be faster and have better information weve used the leverage of that system already in our costcutting initiatives and we think we have a long runway to continue that were not going to make changes overnight its going to be slow and steady well win that race and i think we have a long runway to leverage that and make the company operate more efficiently tod mentioned we want to increase our rd spend but we dont want to take profitability backwards to do that we would envision reducing our transaction processing costs and leveraging some of those dollars into investments to further the company also that system allowed us to begin the ecommerce project this year which comes right on the heels of finishing the erp because we needed a global erp to link the new ecommerce system into it also facilitates the hr project that tod mentioned because we want to link either an oracle or another hr system all to r charles brady thanks and just as a quick followup in the commentary about adding additional capacity to product lines like powercore and liquids are you talking about building out capacity in an existing footprint that you have or is this additional brickandmortar footprint that gets put down tod e carpenter this is tod typically there is both options available to us right now were looking at adding capacity in our current footprint for both of those as we continue to support growth longerterm we have a region for regionbased operation strategy and so we look for for example emea to support all the emeabased customers apac to support all the apac customers and so longerterm over a fiveyear period were likely to add bricks and mortar over time but in the nearterm its more expanding to meet the current demand within the current footprints that we have operator your next question comes from the line of jim giannakouros with oppenheimer your line is open james giannakouros tacking on to that i think charlie just i think was asking just about emea but i wanted to focus specifically on china curious as to what youre seeing specifically there and if there are any changes to your approach there recalling you were pulling back investments there maybe a year or two ago was when i think you announced that tod e carpenter jim this is tod we have seen a bit of a pickup in china midsingledigit increases for example in the q but nothing that would suggest that were going to pickup capex spending within that particular region or that the customer demand is driving the need to do so so still remaining on the current strategy which is a bit more cautious but longerterm china remains strategically very important for the company james giannakouros okay thank you and independent aftermarket i think you said up lowteens and i believe thats more reflective of end market demand versus restocking if i piece your comments of this quarter and last quarter appropriately are you seeing that more in offroad or in onroad and can you talk about sequential trends versus say yearoveryear comps influencing that doubledigit increase that youve now posted tod e carpenter this is tod again its really broadbased its across all regions its both doubledigits at a minimum across all regions its across â offroad certainly driving the higher of the two but in onroad for example in the americas we saw a nice uptick as well so its pretty broadbased regionally and now were starting to see onroad even enter the picture but i would say its more heavily weighted offroad right now brad pogalz jim this is brad ill add to that that your question about sequential both on and offroad in that channel were up sequentially as well highsinglelowdouble range james giannakouros anything above and beyond what you would expect from a seasonal perspective there brad brad pogalz i think it was the normal seasonality what was unique was the baseline in that q was very inflated from the restocking i think thats the thing we are all watching and you guys included is whats going to happen after that big bulge of restocking in second quarter and to see the momentum continue is good for us james giannakouros yes okay thanks last one if i may hard disk drives appreciating that you probably expect continued pressures there as we do they are beyond the nearterm benefits you are citing and the industry is citing how would you frame your desire or willingness to stay in what is apparently a secularly declining market is it a margin or a cash flow contributor such that staying there makes sense or given where you are in your cycle lets say in engine does it make more sense to make some portfolio moves into higher growth andor margin areas where you can leverage your current channel et cetera tod e carpenter so we enjoy a strong position in the market within our disk drive business we understand that that is an industry under secular pressure it will continue to decline for years to come but it will not go away that business will not eviscerate so we look at it as a cash cow we run it to make sure that its very efficient but also to stay in the number one position and it has continued to spin up new technologies and new technology concepts for us as the demands from the customer base continued to remain high so we like that business for a lot of reasons but we do run that as a cash cow type of the business operator your next question comes from the line of brian drab with william blair your line is open brian drab congrats on the results i just wanted to start with just pointing out that obviously the tone on this call is much different from the q call where i think on the q call the message was one data point is in the trend and were cautious on the outlook cautiously optimistic today clearly i think its weve got two really good quarters logged in but it sounds like you are able to look out farther scott made the comments on fiscal  is that just the results were seeing from cat and deere and can you add a little more color as to what is giving you what im interpreting as optimism on the mediumterm outlook now tod e carpenter this is tod so if you look at our customer base and the deere or the cat even cummins when they talk about engines produced all three of those raised their recent guidance for the balance of this calendar year and so we point to them as really good data points that suggest people are feeling a bit more positivity for the balance of this calendar year for us shortterm weve got three more months to go we got another quarter here well end our fiscal year but well take all those data points at that time and well come out in about three months or so and bake that in and give you full year guidance past obviously the calendar year but right now there is certainly a bit more optimism across our customer base and you are seeing that through some of the end market increase and therefore our numbers brian drab okay thanks and then we dont get a great look into whats happening at clarcor anymore but they had recently introduced channel flow product that they claimed was going to be a perfect replacement for powercore in some skus im wondering if you could tell us anything about whether youre seeing them in the market and secondarily is that product being on the shelves at distributors giving you the opportunity to put powercore product into the broader independent distribution channel and maybe resulting in any measurable uptick in your aftermarket business as you stock that product tod e carpenter so as we look at powercore for yeartodate in the replacement parts area where clarcors entry would compete were up in the high teens yearoveryear so were really proud and comfortable with our position there they have really released that to a small subset of parts and so therefore in really keeping with our strategy and teaming with our oes we will continue to honor our strategy of razors to sell razor blades and support them to help them acquire their aftermarket wherever possible the fact that they have that clarcor have put just a couple of part numbers out there does not throw the channel wide open at this time ph brian drab okay thats helpful and then this is going to be a reach but im just going to ask it is there a chance in fiscal  or a level of revenue growth where if achieved that you could generate above  operating margin scott j robinson yes i would say thats a bit of a reach were still working through our plan were committed to delivering incremental profit on revenue growth we have some unique factors that i talked about earlier in my script and i promise well roll out together and well give you the best information we can come the fourth quarter earnings release brian drab okay and just to be â i want to make sure it is clear i was saying its a reach in asking that question trying to get you to say something and then you acknowledged its a reach youre not saying that the margin level is a reach youre saying my question is a reach scott j robinson no i would say your question is a reach tod e carpenter yes we would agree with you your question is a reach yes brian drab right i just wanted to make that clear in the transcript okay thanks scott j robinson we appreciate that tod e carpenter fair clarification and a good one operator your next question comes from the line of laurence alexander with jefferies your line is open daniel rizzo this is dan rizzo on for laurence if we back out gas turbine and special applications it seems like your sales were  in q  in q compared to  in q is there any reason why you cant sustain mid singledigit growth once you lap the stepup in q brad pogalz you lost me in the math dan sorry about that this is brad daniel rizzo im sorry so if we back out gas turbine and special applications i think sales were up  in q  in q up from  in q is there any reason why we cant sustain mid singledigit growth once we lap the stepup in q brad pogalz in aggregate daniel rizzo yes brad pogalz our full year guide i mean im looking at a total number but the implied q guide is up in the high singles if you just pick a part of the math i havent done with the subtractions that youre talking about but i mean clearly gas turbine is a lot of noise in the system the implied guide on that is in the down  range tod e carpenter so maybe â this is tod i would add also that if were going to take a look at the full year and go from q to q we do have some acute events on the engine side on the restocking that we would have to normalize looking forward so that would tamp that down just a little bit we cant just roll it all in i mean brad could do some activities and start to try to figure that out going forward weve not done that suggestive math that youre pointing to daniel rizzo no thats actually very helpful thank you and then a longer term question can you please update us on how that you think the electric vehicles could affect your business both nearterm and over the next decade or so tod e carpenter this is tod so we look at the electrification question obviously very closely in light of europe and some of the legislation thats going on there for the innercity electric buses as well as small vehicles for example small construction equipment in some cities in europe would likely have to move away from diesel its an important question for us however when we look toward electrification while electric will win and displace some diesel engines it will likely enter into the smaller diesel engine sector and at best go into more of the returntohome type of a vehicle so for example it may win some share in a garbage truck for example or something like that that returns in municipality to a homebase but overall there has to be a much greater technology advance for electrification to win in the heavyduty diesel engines so electrification has a place in the future but it is going to take decades to really displace much of the overall diesel engine shares that we see out there today but it will have a small entry point all forecasting that you see today even taking into account worstcase situations worstcase being electrification has a breakthrough et cetera would suggest diesel engines are still going to grow across the world for decades to come operator this concludes todays qa session ill now turn the call back over to tod carpenter for closing remarks tod e carpenter that concludes todays call i want to thank everybody for their time and interest in our company i also want to thank our employees again i am very appreciative of their efforts and i look forward to a strong finish to our fiscal  goodbye operator and this concludes
