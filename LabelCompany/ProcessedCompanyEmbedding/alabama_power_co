pm cdt dateline st paul minn emailpdfprintrss this will significantly reduce our construction time frame and allow the line to be taken out of service for this project without impacting the reliability of our grid st paul minnbusiness wirealabama power co which supplies electricity to  million homes businesses and industrial facilities will become the third major utility to install ms breakthrough electricity conductor the m aluminum conductor composite reinforced accr the m accr is a new type of metal overhead line that can double the transmission capacity of conventional conductors of the same diameter without requiring new towers or any visual changes the m accr will replace a key mile kilometer line in northeastern alabama the change is being made because the existing conductor would be at capacity for certain contingencies resulting from the addition of new generation during summer peak loads beginning in  installation of the m accr is expected to begin in january  the new m conductor which is heatsag resistant was developed to reduce the potential for thermally constrained transmission lines that increasingly have plagued electricity grids in recent years causing brownouts and blackouts across the country in addition the m accr provides the industry with a metal overhead conductor solution alabama power the second largest unit of southern co supplies energy to two thirds of the state its selection of m accr to improve capacity on a key line follows similar decisions by xcel energy for a mile line in minnesota and the western area power administration for an mile line along the colorado river in arizona m expects to announce additional sales of the conductor to utilities around the nation in the coming months the use of the m conductor for this project allowed us to avoid the replacement of  transmission structures and the installation of eight additional structures said andy wallace transmission line manager for alabama power this will significantly reduce our construction time frame and allow the line to be taken out of service for this project without impacting the reliability of our grid tracy anderson m project manager for the m accr said interest in the new conductor is building quickly as a costefficient and reliable way to relieve many of the national grid potential bottlenecks before bringing this product to market we devoted four years to rugged extensive field testing with several utilities and the department of energy under virtually every conceivable atmospheric condition the m accr met every expectation anderson noted that the first two purchases of the m accr were made by utilities that participated in the field testing for installation in areas subject to extreme weather conditions that is a powerful endorsement of the products performance he said the m accr contains a multistrand core of heat resistant aluminum matrix composite wires the conductor retains its strength at high temperatures and is not adversely affected by environmental conditions its lightweight and reduced thermal expansion properties are what enable installation on existing towers with no requirement for visual changes to a line or additional rights of way in addition to the department of energy and the utilities that field tested the m accr m retained the national electric energy testing research and applications center at the georgia institute of technology to test the conductor during development the m accrs technology has been recognized by rd magazine with an rd  award as one of the most technologically significant products introduced into the marketplace and by the minnesota high tech association with a tekne award for innovative development more information about the

mil as of mar  alabama power cos quarterly gross ppe increased from sep   mil to dec   mil and increased from dec   mil to mar   mil alabama power cos annual gross ppe increased from dec   mil to dec   mil and increased from dec   mil to dec   mil definition property plant and equipment ppe are the fixed assets of the company fixed assets are also known as noncurrent assets property plant and equipment includes assets that will  in the normal course of business  neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers some of the most common parts of property plant and equipment are  land  buildings and leasehold improvements  transportation equipment  manufacturing equipment  office equipment  office furniture companies with lots of property plant and equipment often have special categories for example railroad property includes  track  ties  ballast  bridges  tunnels  signals  locomotives  freight cars there is often a note in the financial statements  found in a companys k  that will explain the different categories of property a company owns the market value of property plant and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property plant and equipment for example when berkshire hathaway liquidated its textile mills it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away that property plant and equipment was literally worth less than zero on the other hand some companies own thousands of acres of land all property plant and equipment other than land is depreciated land is never depreciated however land is not marked up to market value either under generally accepted accounting principles gaap land is shown on the balance sheet at cost the property plant and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property plant and equipment this means it is the cost of the property plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation explanation a company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive the company replaces when it wears out on the other hand a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits there is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures think coca cola johnson  johnson etc related terms total assets accumulated depreciation property plant and equipment historical data  all numbers are in millions except for per share
