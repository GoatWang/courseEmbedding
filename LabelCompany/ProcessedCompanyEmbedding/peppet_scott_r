ethical theory to argue for a radical revision of the legal professions codes of ethics that revision would end the legal profession as we know itone profession regulated by one set of ethical rules that apply to all lawyers regardless of circumstance it would replace the existing uniform conception of the lawyers role with a more heterogeneous profession in which lawyers and clients could contractually choose the ethical obligations under which they wanted to operate this contract model of legal ethics in which lawyers could opt in and out of various ethical constraints would lead to

the harvard negotiation research project’s prior gems of wisdom on negotiation around the central theme of creating value the book should be required reading for all lawyers and law students for all mediators and judges it is a book that every lawyer should ask his or her client to read or reread prior to commencing any important transaction or dispute negotiation or mediation crafted in a readerfriendly style the book energetically promotes an interdisciplinary approach to problemsolving in negotiation… in contrast to other experts’ advice to be reactive initially in a negotiation the authors here encourage a proactive ‘take charge’ approach to engaging negotiators across the table in problemsolving this approach is not initially directed to the substance of the dispute or transaction but rather to the nature and structure of the negotiation process that the parties might together design… this is a book for everyone who negotiates—a universe that includes all of us inevitably it will move lawyers into a new paradigm of thinking about higherquality solutions in negotiation and mediation and about how to achieve the best possible results for their clients it is bound to change the world of negotiation in this new millennium”—john w cooley aba journal “the practice of law has become more contentious and competitive not less the authors of beyond winning…advocate that parties instead practice ‘value creation’ ie the attempt to ‘enlarge the pie’ so that both parties to a negotiation receive bigger returns… the book does an excellent job of breaking down relationships players tensions and organizations to lay bare the innerworkings of the actors in a negotiation and the situations they create because of its unique objective of educating attorneys and clients beyond winning is a good addition to any library on negotiation”—william j estes new york law journal “conventional negotiating strategy often requires adversarial positions but the authors propose viewing negotiating as a problemsolving task… they explain that creating value is the key to successful negotiating the goal should not be to win the biggest piece of the pie but to make the pie bigger”—david rouse booklist “observing that today’s tough adversarial legal negotiations preempt mutually beneficial problem solving between parties mnookin and his coauthors urge lawyers to adopt a proactive optimistic and realistic mindset to transform their practices… although aimed…at attorneys who want to serve clients’ broader needs better as well as to protect their interests the authors’ practical straightforward and jargonfree style makes this a valuable resource for anybody who is about to hire an attorney file a lawsuit or sign a contract”—publishers weekly “on the cutting edge of negotiation literature beyond winning is a spectacular integration of our contemporary understanding of negotiation modern social science and the legal context this is an excellent book and is sure to become a mustread for lawyers law students and executives who deal with the legal process on a regular basis”—max bazerman harvard business school “the authors provide specific concrete strategies lawyers and their clients can employ to mitigate the tensions that make legal negotiation so difficult they integrate theory and practice in ways that do justice to the complexity of each”—jennifer girarda brown quinnipiac college school of law “much negotiation literature suffers from one of two problems either it is too theoretical to be of use to practitioners or it is simplistic purporting to give advice to negotiators in cookbook form beyond winning captures the most important theoretical economic and social science material and uses vivid examples to demonstrate techniques for using theoretical insights in practice the minicase histories and transcripts of portions of negotiations that appear throughout the book are especially valuable ways both to illustrate theory and to provide practical guidance for its application”—carol b liebman columbia law school “with its lively examples and its innovative framework for managing the tensions

colorado law legal studies research paper no   pages posted  aug    scott r peppet university of colorado law school abstract this article argues for a new regulatory approach that could both increase market efficiency and protect informational privacy in the modern information economy it explores that approach  information intermediation or infomediation  in the context of the current debates about reengineering the mortgage markets in the wake of the  financial crisis in particular the article is the first scholarly work to introduce the concept of “smart mortgages”  loans and mortgage securities with more rich and dynamically updated information than traditional mortgage products the article considers recent regulatory and industry momentum behind smart mortgages and contrasts the market efficiencies created by such proposals against the individual and social privacy harms a smart mortgage system would inflict it argues that policy makers should consider information intermediation as a regulatory option to capture the efficiency gains of smart mortgages while preserving individual informational privacy and considers the implications of infomediation beyond the mortgage context for other similar debates about the future of privacy in an informationrich economy in particular the article concludes by comparing the smart mortgage and healthcare reform debates and showing the possible role of infomediation in each in sum the author argues that smart mortgages done properly could be a foundational step forwards as an example of regulatory sophistication
