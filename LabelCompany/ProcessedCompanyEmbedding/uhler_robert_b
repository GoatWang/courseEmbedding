the different ‘shades of grey’ in interpreting integrity when i joined the business world frankly it was a struggle as i watched seniors interpret their individual honor code in what fell into the

winning with razor blades  at harvard business school i learned several simple broad strategy theories which have always stuck with me and set my “strategic sails’” one of these theories was “the profit margin rapidly increases with identical repetitious products while the risk of failure dramatically decreases” i met with a venture capitalist who described his acquisition strategy as buying a set of “razor blade” businesses “razor blade” strategy specifically refers to the business concept that if a company like gillette sells a new fusion razor with a proprietary design for the blade head they are actually selling a multiyear annuity of razor blade replacements these proprietary razor blade heads are massproduced for several pennies and yet sold for close to  per blade yielding an enormous profit that lasts as long as the person uses the razor in fact so much profit is generated in the annuity that it pays to spend enormous amounts on advertising in order to get people to switch to the newest razor the razor itself can even be thought of as a lost leader of course this concept is well documented in pharmaceuticals cds water purity cartridges apparel automotive parts software products ipod and tablet apps etc the real profit is not made in the original capital cost of the first item but rather the repeat sale of a proven solution additionally the greater the volume the higher the margin goes up therefore the profit can be exponential for repeatables  repeatable product companies carry the highest profit margins in all industry sectors many service company

because you have an everincreasing personal experience record on knowing that they are pretty accurate in fact in postretirement interviews with ceos their number one regret is that they did not trust their instincts and act fast enough  they say this not because history didn’t prove their eventual actions right but because their instincts told them to take the action long before they did and they wasted too much time instincts are not something you are born with they are developed through your career by observation of others and your own record with decisionmaking both good and bad each event that requires a decision that you make is recorded and stored in a mental accumulative database over time your instincts get increasingly accurate to reality but rarely do leaders know when to trust them fully when our instincts tell us one thing we immediately check with our past knowledge “data banks” to see if there is compelling evidence to give us confidence in that instinct instinct is nearly immediate it is a ‘gutfeel’ well before the facts are revealed when we have a strong instinct we go on a journey to convince ourselves to take action since this a ‘shade of grey’ issue i have found it difficult in giving people i mentor guidance about when to trust their instincts and act the truth is it is different for all people individually people have different rates of learning and requirements to make decisions on which instincts are verified but i think the issue is so important for a leader i thought i would take the risk of offering some guidance delineated by age group under age  discover your instincts … by robert uhlertfebruary st career lessons commentsread more permalinkgallerywhen optimism is delusionalcareer lessons when optimism is delusional  i’ve never been sure if optimism is caused by nature or nurture after observing my children and talking to other parents i am inclined to believe optimism is genetic many people consider this dichotomy to be either a “half full or half empty” view of the world i am blessed with the “halffull gene” and have found that many other accomplished people tend to have it too however it is not a universal truth i have also known successful “halfempty gene” leaders as long as they understand their disposition and surround themselves with teammates who are upbeat they succeed by creating balance and democratic decision input part of the reason i believe that optimists are often more successful than the “halfempty” personality is that they can more easily attract quality talent and heighten morale—people want to work with someone who has confidence in success employees seek to feel good and the subsequent selfconfidence from positive leadership increases the odds of them fulfilling their personal goals leaders who view things as “halfempty” tend to avoid taking risks which creates insecurity they need much more data and facts to be convinced of a situation which slows the entire team further employees find it hard to get excited about working for a pessimist as it constantly puts them on the defensive regardless of disposition bad things happen to everyone at some point or another i can still clearly recall the most emotionally devastating event in my career when i was operating a small unit a key person left without warning to join a competitor to me it was a very loud statement that they would rather trust their career in a group of strangers rather than the people they had worked with for … by robert uhlertjanuary th career lessons commentsread more permalinkgalleryare staff leaders strategic assetscareer lessons are staff leaders strategic assets  while i typically focus my articles toward highranking profit and loss leaders such as ceos and line managers i’d like to take the opportunity to discuss level  leaders for staff departments including accounting human resources it support corporate communications and legal oftentimes top executives struggle with determining these individuals’ roles and evaluating their contribution as level  staff members are often seen as costly necessities to the rank and file employees and have little impact on the company they can be seen as bureaucrats or policy gatekeepers living off the revenue execution talent of others and are often known to make business difficult level  staff executives are paid sizable salaries and often benefit from large bonuses immune from enterprise performance they can be seen to have little direct effect on profit and are not held accountable except by subjective opinion relative to “likeability” or their relationship with the ceo because they lack direct ownership for numerical kpis mediocre functional staff chiefs can skate for years without much quantitative accountability many are perceived to contribute only as process advisors when a crisis occurs for the line officers and client servers in numerous companies employees have a right in evaluating the functional staff leadership as ‘maintenance personnel’ in that they do not have the longterm competitive impact to justify their costs this leadership can have considerable authority but little quantitative accountability if their only role is proven to be only functional transactions the positions would be cheaper being outsourced or even automated despite this level  functional staff can be the most valuable business leaders in the organization if they are talented and their position is clearly defined and regulated i believe the most successful chief functional leaders … by robert uhlertnovember st career lessons commentsread more permalinkgallerygoing beyond the open door policycareer lessons going beyond the open door policy  most senior leaders i know consider themselves to be far more accessible than they really are they believe attending events such as weekly office meetings the annual christmas party offsite planning meetings and various office mixers makes them accessible however the truth is they continue to be surrounded by the same group of  to  people who dominate their attention and skew their information base providing them with a false sense of “unbiased” knowledge a leader’s ability to know what is really going on in a company has much to do with the breadth of their information sources if the sources are constantly the same a leader could miss what is really happening at the different levels within the company this often results in an issue escalating into a crisis before an executive can even realize there is a problem leaders fool themselves by having “open door” policies they assume their employees will feel comfortable enough to walk into their office with pertinent information an “open door” policy is fine but in a decentralized office environment only the people at that location have access and those employees most likely would not feel comfortable talking outside the normal chain of command generally because of rank and title leaders are perceived to be intimidating and oftentimes even aloof in addition subordinate leaders often give directives such as “don’t tell the boss” and punish those who express their ideas to a “higher chain of command” without permission these types of unspoken or unwritten rules exist often without a leader’s knowledge i found that in order to get more clear and unbiased information i had
