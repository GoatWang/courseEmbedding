and stability for your family the purpose of life insurance is to help provide your loved ones with financial protection after you die in exchange for the premiums you pay to your insurer during your lifetime some life insurance policies can provide you with financial protection for the short term while others accumulate cash value offering a living benefit that can be used for supplemental retirement income funding for a childs education or cash for emergencies term life insurance term life insurance provides coverage for a set period of time at a generally lower cost than permanent insurance many term life insurance products allow you to convert to a permanent policy such as whole life insurance the cost of insuring oneself increases over time so its important to understand your short and longterm needs for financial security when you select a policy permanent life insurance permanent life insurance provides you with financial protection for your entire life as long as the policy remains in force because of the flexibility permanent life insurance offers there are several types of policies you can purchase whole life insurance the benefits of whole life insurance include guaranteed fixed premiums a guaranteed death benefit and guaranteed cash value growth this means that with whole life insurance your premiums never increase as long as theyre paid and you can also take advantage of living benefits which enable you to borrow against the cash value of the policy for any purpose while youre alive borrowing cash from the policy can help in financing lifechanging events or emergencies and the policys cash value accumulates on a taxdeferred basis one thing to keep in mind when purchasing whole life insurance is that loans reduce the death benefit of your policy and loan interest should be repaid in order to prevent lapse universal life insurance universal life insurance provides lifetime death benefit protection along with flexibility that gives you choices as your needs and finances change it offers options such as coverage amounts that may be increased or decreased and premiums that you can vary based on your finances as long as there is enough money in the account to pay for the monthly insurance and administrative charges variable universal life insurance variable universal life introduces an investment component with variable universal life you can allocate net premiums and account values among divisions of a separate account and guaranteed principal account  you can direct a portion of your net premium payments to any of the investment options available through the separate account depending on the particular variable universal life product each investment option offers a different level of risk and growth potential one feature of variable universal life insurance and universal life is its premium flexibility you can skip payments as long as your policy has accumulated enough account value to meet the monthly deductions also you can add numerous riders to your policy riders are available for an additional premium variable life insurance policies are sold by prospectus before purchasing a variable life insurance policy investors should carefully consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the variable life insurance policy and its underlying investment choices for this and other information obtain the prospectuses for the variable life insurance policy and its underlying investment choices from your registered representative please read the prospectuses carefully before investing or sending money survivorship life insurance survivorship life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance that covers two people on one policy and pays a death benefit after both people on the policy have died the cost for survivorship life insurance is usually lower than the cost of two individual policies  distributions under the policy including cash dividends and partialfull surrenders are not subject to taxation up to the amount paid into the policy the cost basis if the policy is a modified endowment contract policy loans andor distributions are taxable to the extent of gain and are subject to a  tax penalty access to cash values through borrowing or partial surrenders can reduce the policys cash value and death benefit increase the chance the policy will lapse and may result in a tax liability if the policy terminates before the death of the insured  guarantees are based on the claims paying ability of the issuing company or companies crn write call or come

of death we pay the beneficiary the death benefit amount determined as of the date the insured dies the beneficiary may direct us to pay all or part of the benefit in cash or to apply it under one or more of our payment options minimum face amount to qualify as life insurance under federal tax laws currently in effect the policy has a minimum face amount we determine the minimum face amount by multiplying the account value by the minimum face amount percentage the percentages depend upon the insureds age death benefit options in the application or enrollment form you choose a selected face amount and death benefit option we offer two death benefit options  death benefit option a the death benefit is the greater of the selected face amount in effect on the date of death or the minimum face amount in effect on the date of death  death benefit option b the death benefit is the greater of a the sum of the selected face amount in effect on the date of death plus the account value on the date of death or b the minimum face amount in effect on the date of death if the insured dies while the policy is in force we will pay the death benefit based on the option in effect on the date of death with the following adjustments o we add the part of any account value charges that apply for the period beyond the date of death and o we deduct any policy debt outstanding on the date of death and o we deduct any account value charges unpaid as of the date of death if the insured dies after the first policy year we will also include a prorata share of any dividend allocated to the policy for the year death occurs under death benefit option a the death benefit amount is unaffected by your policys investment experience unless the death benefit is based on the minimum face amount under death benefit option b the death benefit amount may increase or decrease by investment experience we pay interest on the death benefit from the date of death to the date the death benefit is paid or a payment option becomes effective the interest rate equals the rate determined under the interest payment option example the following example shows how the death benefit may vary as a result of investment performance and death benefit option in effect on the date of death policy a policy b   a selected face amount   b account value on date of death   c minimum face amount percentage on date of death   e minimum face amount b x c   death benefit if death benefit option a is in effect greater of a or d   death benefit if death benefit option b is in effect greater of a  b or d   the examples assume no additions to or deductions from the selected face amount or minimum face amount are applicable you may change your death benefit option by written request and subject to our guidelines regarding proof  of insurability there is no charge for a change in death benefit option the effective date of the change will be your first policy anniversary on or next following the later of o  days after we receive and approve your written request for such change or o the requested effective date of the change changes in selected face amount you may increase the selected face amount by sending us a new enrollment form or by sending us an application if you are no longer associated with your employer we may request adequate evidence of insurability for an increase we will not allow an increase in the selected face amount after the policy anniversary date following the insureds th birthday additionally any increase in the selected face amount will be effective on the monthly calculation date which is on or next follows the later of o  days after we have received and approved your written request for such change or o the requested effective date of the change any increase for policyowners no longer associated with the employer must be at least  you may also decrease your policys selected face amount we allow a decrease in the selected face amount only once per policy year the selected face amount after a decrease must be at least  any requested decrease in the selected face amount will be effective on the monthly calculation date which is on or next follows the later of o  days after we receive and approve your written request for such change o the one year period following the effective date of your previously requested decrease or o the requested effective date of the change account value the account value of your policy is the value in the separate account divisions plus the value in the gpa initially this value equals the net amount of the first premium you and your employer paid under the policy we apply this amount to the gpa until the expiration of the free look period the account value is then allocated among the separate account divisions andor the gpa according to your instructions subject to applicable restrictions we always apply billed modal term premiums payable by the employer to the gpa the purchase and sale of accumulation units will affect your account value in the separate account divisions we purchase and sell units at the unit value as of the valuation time on the valuation date if we receive your transaction request before the valuation time otherwise we will purchase and sell units to complete your request at the unit value as of the valuation time on the next following valuation date or a later date if you request we determine unit values on each valuation date investment return the investment return of a policy is based on o the account value held in each separate account division for that policy o the investment experience of each separate account division as measured by its actual net rate of return and o the interest rate credited on account value held in the gpa the investment experience of a separate account division reflects o increases or decreases in the net asset value of the shares of the underlying fund o any dividend or capital gains distributions declared by the fund and o any charges against the assets of the separate account division we determine the investment experience each day on each valuation date the actual net rate of return for a separate account division measures the investment experience from the end of one valuation date to the end of the next valuation date cash surrender value you may surrender your policy for its cash surrender value at any time while the insured is living the cash surrender value is o account value less o any outstanding policy debt there is no surrender charge your surrender is effective on the date we receive the policy and a fully completed written request at our home office unless you select a later effective date if however we receive your surrender request on a date that is not a valuation date or after a valuation  time then your surrender will be effective on the next valuation date transfers you may transfer all or part of the account value among the policys separate account divisions and the gpa by written request in your transfer request you must indicate the dollar amount or the wholenumber percentage you wish to transfer there is no limit on the number of transfers you may make from the separate account divisions you may maintain account value in a maximum of eight separate account divisions and the gpa at any one time if you want to transfer net premium or transfer account value to a ninth division you must transfer  of the account value from one or more of the eight active separate account divisions you may transfer all account value in the separate account to the gpa at any time without incurring a fee the transfer will take effect when we receive your signed written request we will consider all transfers made on one valuation date to be one transfer we currently do not charge a fee for transfers we however reserve the right to charge a fee for transfers if there are more than twelve transfers in a policy year this fee will not exceed  per transfer you may only transfer account value from the gpa to the separate account once per policy year this transfer may not exceed the lesser of o  of your account value in the gpa at the time of your transfer or o your account value in the gpa less an amount equal to one plus the number of monthly calculation dates remaining in your modal term multiplied by your most recent monthly deduction for purposes of this transfer restriction your account value in the gpa does not include policy debt however you may transfer  of your account value in the gpa to the separate account if o you have transferred  of your account value in the gpa in each of the previous three policy years and o you have not allocated premium payments or made transfers to the gpa during any of the previous three policy years except as a result of a policy loan you cannot transfer gpa account value equal to any policy debt automated account value transfer automated account value transfer allows you to make monthly transfers of account value in a separate account division to any combination of separate account divisions and the gpa you must specify the amount you wish to transfer as a dollar amount or a wholenumber percentage automated account value transfers are not available from more than one separate account division or from the gpa we consider this process as one transfer per policy year you can elect change or cancel automated account value transfer on any valuation date provided we receive a fully completed written request we will only make transfers on the monthly calculation date the effective date of the first automated transfer will be the first monthly calculation date after we receive your request at our home office if we receive your request before the end of the free look period your first automated transfer will occur at the end of this period transfers will occur automatically however you must specify o the separate account division we are to transfer from and o the separate account divisions andor gpa we are to transfer to and o the length of time during which transfers will continue if your transfer amount is greater than your account value in the separate account division we are transferring from then we will transfer your remaining value in that division in the same proportion as your previously transferred amounts we will not process any more automated transfers thereafter automated account rebalancing automated account rebalancing permits you to maintain a specified wholenumber percentage of your account value in any combination of the separate account divisions and the gpa we must receive a fully completed written request in order to begin your automated account rebalancing program then we will make transfers on a quarterly basis to and from the separate account divisions and the gpa to readjust your account value to your specified percentage the minimum amount we will transfer under this provision  is  this program allows you to maintain a specific fund allocation quarterly rebalancing is based on your policy year we will rebalance your account value only on a monthly calculation date we consider automated account rebalancing as one transfer per policy year you can elect or cancel automated account rebalancing on any valuation date provided we receive a fully completed written request you may only change allocation percentages once each policy year in addition you may only reduce your allocation to the gpa by up to  once each policy year the effective date of the first automated rebalancing will be the first monthly calculation date after we receive your request at the home office if we receive the request before the end of the free look period your first rebalancing will occur at the end of the free look period the automated account rebalancing program is not subject to the restrictions on transfers from the gpa to the separate account you may participate in either the automated account value transfer program or the automated account rebalancing program at one time withdrawals after your policy has been in force for six months you can withdraw value from your policy on any monthly calculation date you must send written request to our home office o minimum withdrawal amount  before deducting the withdrawal charge o maximum withdrawal amount cash surrender value less an amount equal to one plus the number of monthly calculation dates remaining in your modal term multiplied by your most recent monthly deduction we deduct the withdrawal amount from your account value as of the valuation time on the applicable monthly calculation date you must specify the gpa or the separate account divisions from which the withdrawal is to be made if you do not specify otherwise we will withdraw the amount in proportion from your values in the separate account divisions and the gpa in excess of one plus the number of monthly calculation dates remaining in your modal term multiplied by your most recent monthly deduction and subject to restrictions on amounts in the gpa the withdrawal amount may not exceed the nonloaned account value of a separate account division or gpa a withdrawal from the gpa may not exceed an amount equal to one plus the number of monthly calculation dates remaining in your modal term multiplied by your most recent monthly deduction we deduct a charge of  of the amount you withdraw this charge will not exceed  we will reduce your account value by the amount of the withdrawal if necessary we will reduce your policys selected face amount to prevent an increase in the amount at risk unless you provide us with satisfactory evidence of insurability withdrawals may have tax consequences policy loan privilege the policy loan privilege becomes effective  months after the policy date you can take a loan on your policy at any time while the insured is living the maximum loan is o  of your account value at the time of the loan less o any outstanding policy debt before the new loan less o interest on the loan being made and on any outstanding policy debt to the next policy anniversary date less o an amount equal to one plus the number of monthly calculation dates remaining in your modal term multiplied by your most recent monthly deduction you must properly assign your policy to us as collateral for the loan source of loan we deduct your requested loan amount from the separate account divisions and the gpa in proportion to the nonloaned account value of each on the date of the loan request however an amount equal to one plus the number of monthly calculation dates remaining in your modal term multiplied by your most recent monthly deduction must remain in the gpa we liquidate shares taken from the separate account divisions and transfer the resulting dollar amounts to the gpa these dollar amounts become part of the loaned portion of the gpa you may not borrow from the loaned portion of the gpa we may delay any loan from the nonloaned portion of the gpa for up to six months we may also delay any  loan from the separate account if o the new york stock exchange is closed except for normal weekend and holiday closings or o trading is restricted or o the securities and exchange commission determines that an emergency exists or o the securities and exchange commission permits us to delay payment if loans exceed the policy account value policy debt is your outstanding loan balance including accrued interest policy debt must not exceed your account value if this limit is reached we may terminate the policy if we terminate your policy for this reason we will notify you and any assignee shown on our records in writing this notice states the amount necessary to bring the policy debt back within the limit if we do not receive a payment within  days after the date we mailed the notice the policy terminates without value at the end of those  days termination of a policy under these circumstances could cause you to recognize gross income interest your employer elects a loan interest rate of  per year or where permitted an adjustable loan rate all policies within a case must have the same fixed or adjustable loan rate we set the adjustable loan rate each year that will apply for the next policy year the maximum rate is based on the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds as published by moodys investors service if moodys is no longer published we will use a substantially similar average the maximum rate is the greater of o the published monthly average for the calendar month ending two months before the policy year begins or o  we will increase the rate if the maximum limit is at least  higher than the rate in effect for the previous year we will decrease the rate if the maximum limit is at least  lower than the rate in effect for the previous year interest accrues daily becoming part of the policy debt interest is due on each policy anniversary if you do not pay interest when due we will add the interest to the loan and it will bear interest at the same rate we treat any interest capitalized on a policy anniversary the same as a new loan we will deduct this capitalized interest from the separate account divisions and the gpa in proportion to the nonloaned account value in each repayment you may repay all or part of any policy debt at any time while your policy is in force upon repayment we will transfer values equal to the repayment from the loaned portion of the gpa to the nonloaned portion of the gpa and the applicable separate account divisions we will transfer the repayment in proportion to the nonloaned value in each separate account division andor the gpa at the time of repayment if you do not repay the loan we deduct the loan amount due from the surrender value or death benefit interest credited on loaned value the amount equal to any outstanding policy loans is held in the gpa this amount is credited with interest at a rate which is the greater of  or your policy loan rate less a massmutual declared charge this charge is currently  we guarantee that this charge will not exceed  effect of loan your policy loan reduces the death benefit and cash surrender value under the policy by the amount of the loan your repayment of the loan increases the death benefit and cash surrender value by the amount of the repayment as long as a loan is outstanding a portion of your policys account value equal to the loan is held in the gpa the separate accounts investment performance does not affect this amount tax consequences may result if you have policy debt when you surrender your policy part ii  additional provisions of the policy paidup policy date the paidup policy date is the policy anniversary nearest the insureds th birthday on

deductions on the correct age suicide exclusion if the insured commits suicide whether sane or insane within two years from the issue date we will pay a limited death benefit in one sum to the beneficiary the limited death benefit is the amount of premiums paid for the policy less any policy debt or amounts withdrawn if the insured commits suicide whether sane or insane within two years from an increase in the selected face amount and while the policy is in force we will pay a limited benefit to the beneficiary the limited death benefit is the cost of insurance charges associated

rider at your employers request the policy can include additional benefits we approve these benefits based on our standards and limits for issuing insurance and classifying risks any additional benefit we provide by rider is subject to the terms of both the rider and the policy we deduct the cost of any rider from your account value subject to state availability the following riders are available accelerated benefits rider this rider permits part of the proceeds of the policy to be available before death if the insured becomes terminally ill we will require proof satisfactory to us

do not give us the required satisfactory  proof of continued total disability or o the insured fails or refuses to have a required examination or o the policy anniversary date after the insureds th birthday or if later the date two years from the date the total disability began part iii  other important information federal income tax considerations the following discussion presents a general description of the federal income tax consequences of the policy in accordance with our understanding of current federal income tax laws it is not an exhaustive study of all tax issues that might arise under the policy this discussion is not intended as tax advice we make no representation as to the likelihood of continuation of current federal income tax laws and treasury regulations or of the current interpretations of the internal revenue service we reserve the right to make changes in the policy to ensure it qualifies as life insurance for tax purposes we do not address state or other applicable tax laws in this discussion we make no guarantee regarding the future tax treatment of any policy for complete consideration of federal and state tax consequences you should consult a qualified tax adviser prior to purchasing the policy under current state laws we may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in state or local tax laws we reserve the right to charge the separate account for such taxes if attributable to the separate account policy proceeds premiums and loans we believe the policy meets the statutory definition of life insurance under internal revenue code code section  and thus receives the same tax treatment as that given to fixed benefit life insurance as a result the policys death benefit is generally excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary under section a of the code an exception to this general rule is where a policy has been transferred for value in that case only the portion of the death benefit equal to premiums paid for the policy may be excluded from gross income upon your full surrender of a policy for its cash surrender value you may recognize ordinary income for federal tax purposes ordinary income is the amount by which o account value including o outstanding policy debt which may include unpaid interest exceeds o premiums paid but not previously recovered decreases in selected face amount and withdrawals may be taxable depending on the circumstances code section f states that if a reduction of future benefits occurs during the first  years after a policy is issued and if there is a cash distribution associated with that reduction you may be taxed on all or part of the amount distributed after  years such cash distributions are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent they exceed the total amount of premiums paid but not previously recovered generally if a taxable event does not otherwise exist a withdrawal is taxable only if it exceeds your yet unrecovered premium contributions we suggest that you consult your tax adviser prior to decreasing your selected face amount or taking a withdrawal if you change the policyowner or the insured or exchange or assign your policy tax consequences may occur we also believe that under current law any policy loan will be treated as policy debt therefore no part of any loan under a policy will constitute income to you under the personal interest limitation provisions of the code interest on policy loans used for personal purposes which otherwise meet the requirements of code section  will no longer be tax deductible other rules may apply to allow all or part of the interest expense as a deduction if the loan proceeds are used for trade or business or investment purposes we suggest you consult your tax adviser for further guidance on the deductibility for tax purposes of the interest on policy loans if a business or corporation owns the policy the code may impose additional restrictions the interest deduction available for loans against a businessowned policy is limited for those corporations subject to the alternative minimum tax there may be an indirect tax upon the inside buildup of gain the corporate alternative minimum tax could also apply to a portion of the amount by which death benefits received exceed the policys cash value at date of death  federal state and local estate inheritance and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depend on the circumstances of each policyowner or beneficiary for complete information on the impact of changes to your policy and federal and state tax considerations you should consult a qualified tax adviser modified endowment contracts if your policy becomes a modified endowment contract loans collateral assignments and other amounts distributed are taxable to the extent of any accumulated income in the policy in general the amount subject to tax is the excess of the account value both loaned and unloaned over the previously unrecovered premiums paid any death benefits we pay under a modified endowment contract however are not taxed any differently from death benefits payable under other life insurance contracts a policy is a modified endowment contract if it satisfies the definition of life insurance in the code but fails the additional pay test a policy fails this test if the accumulated amount paid under the policy at any time during the first seven policy years exceeds the total premiums that would have been payable under a policy providing for guaranteed benefits upon the payment of seven level annual premiums regardless a policy which would otherwise satisfy the pay test will still be taxed as a modified endowment contract if it is received in exchange for a modified endowment contract certain changes will require us to retest a policy to determine whether it has become a modified endowment contract for example a reduction in death benefits during the first seven contract years will cause us to retest the policy as if it had originally been issued with the reduced death benefit if the premiums actually paid into a policy exceed the limits under the pay test for a policy with the reduced death benefit the policy will become a modified endowment contract this change is effective retroactively to the contract year in which the actual premiums paid exceed the new pay limits in addition a material change occurring at any time while the policy is in force will require us to retest the policy to determine whether it continues to meet the pay test a material change starts a new pay test period the term material change includes many increases in death benefits since the policy provides for flexible premium payments we will carefully monitor the policy to determine whether increases in death benefits or additional premium payments cause either the start of a new pay test period or the taxation of distributions and loans all additional premium payments will be considered if any amount is taxable as a distribution of income under a modified endowment contract it will also be subject to a  penalty tax limited exceptions from the additional penalty tax are available for individual policyowners these exceptions include o distributions made on or after the date the taxpayer attains age   or o distributions attributable to the taxpayers becoming disabled or o distributions that are part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made not less frequently than annually made for the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer once a policy fails the pay test loans collateral assignments and distributions occurring in the year of failure and thereafter become subject to the rules for modified endowment contracts in addition any distribution or loan made within two years prior to failing the pay test is considered to have been made in anticipation of the failure and may result in tax consequences for purposes of determining the amount of income received from a modified endowment contract the law requires the aggregation of all modified endowment contracts issued to the same policyowner by an insurer and its affiliates within the same calendar year therefore loans and distributions from any one such policy are taxable to the extent of the income accumulated in all the contracts required to be aggregated you should consult a qualified tax adviser for complete information on modified endowment contract status especially in the case of a corporateowned policy diversification standards to comply with final regulations under code section h final regulations each fund is required to diversify its investments all securities of the same issuer are treated as a single investment each government agency or instrumentality however is treated as a separate issuer  we intend to comply with the final regulations to ensure the policy continues to qualify as life

distribution plan or �rule b plan� is described in the fund�s prospectus � see the fund prospectuses for more information  introduction �  any values in the policy held as of the issue date will be allocated to the money market division on the first valuation date after the issue date � net premium allocation when applying for the policy you indicate how you want net premiums allocated among the divisions and the gpa you may change your net premium allocation at any time just send a notice to us at our administrative office � you may set your net premium allocation in terms of wholenumber percentages that add to  also see overall limitation on net premium allocations and transfers � transfers � you may transfer all or part of the account value invested in a division of the separate account to any other division or to the gpa see overall limitation on net premium allocations and transfers simply send us a request although currently there is no limit on the number of transfers you may make we reserve the right to limit the number to no more than one every  days if we impose a limit it would not apply to a transfer of all values in the separate account divisions to the gpa or to transfers made in connection with any automatedtransfer program we offer � we limit transfers from the gpa to the separate account divisions to one each policy year you may not transfer more than  of the fixed account value less any policy debt at the time of the transfer there is one exception to this rule if you � � have transferred  of the fixed account value each year for three consecutive policy years and � � you have not added any net premiums or transfer amounts to the gpa during these three years then � you may transfer the remainder of the fixed account value less any policy debt out of the gpa in the succeeding policy year in this case you must transfer the full amount out of the gpa in one transaction � any transfer is effective on the valuation date at the price next determined after we receive the request in good order at our administrative office we do not charge for transfers � overall limitation on net premium allocations and transfers you may allocate net premiums and transfer amounts to up to  divisions over the life of the policy we reserve the right to increase this limit � in addition we may need to further limit access to divisions of the separate account so the policy will continue to qualify as life insurance see the investor control section of federal income tax considerations in part v for more information � dollar cost averaging program � dollar cost averaging dca may be a way to soften the effects of shortterm market fluctuations on one�s investment returns it is an automatedtransfer program � initially an amount of money is placed in one division of the separate account then over a stipulated period of time and at a preset frequency a specified amount of account value is transferred from that �source division� and allocated to other divisions �object divisions� � since the same specified dollar amount is transferred to each object division at a preset frequency more accumulation units are purchased when prices are low than when prices are high therefore a lower average cost per unit may be achievable than through a lumpsum purchase of units or through nonlevel purchases of units � dollar cost averaging will not assure you of a profit and will not protect you against a loss in declining markets since our dca program anticipates continued investment during periods of fluctuating prices you should consider your ability to assume the financial risks of continuing dca through periods of fluctuating price levels � to elect dca complete our dca election form and send it to us for processing you may specify a termination date for dca if you wish to do so � if on a specified dca transfer date however the source division does not have enough value to make the transfers you elected dca will automatically terminate � you may not elect dollar cost averaging for the policy while portfolio rebalancing is in effect for the policy � we may at any time modify suspend or terminate the dollar cost averaging program without prior notification � portfolio rebalancing program � portfolio rebalancing is a way to maintain specified ratios of account values among selected divisions of the separate account it is an automatedtransfer program � over time varying investment performance among divisions may cause the ratios of your account value in those divisions to change you may automatically rebalance the portions in the divisions you select with portfolio rebalancing � you may choose divisions �balance divisions� among which you wish to maintain certain relative proportions of account value at a preset frequency we will make transfers among these balance divisions so that your account value in these divisions will again match the ratios you desire � to elect portfolio rebalancing complete our portfolio rebalancing election form and send it to us for processing � you may not elect portfolio rebalancing while dollar cost averaging is in effect for the policy � we may at any time modify suspend or terminate the portfolio rebalancing program without prior notification � policy termination and reinstatement � the policy will not terminate simply because you do not make planned premium payments conversely making planned premium payments does not guarantee that the policy will remain in force � the policy may terminate if its account value cannot cover the monthly charges and the safety test is not met � if the policy does terminate you may be permitted to reinstate it � grace period and termination the policy may terminate without value if � � its account value less any outstanding policy debt on a monthly charge date cannot cover the monthly charges due and � � the safety test is not met on that date � however we allow a grace period for payment of the premium amount not less than  needed to avoid termination we will mail you a notice stating this amount � the policy will terminate without value if we do not receive the required payment by the end of the grace period detailed description of policy features � iii investment options � the guaranteed principal account � you may allocate some or all of the net premiums to the guaranteed principal account �gpa� you also may transfer some or all of the account value in the divisions of the separate account to the gpa neither our general investment account nor the gpa is registered under federal or state securities laws � amounts allocated to the gpa become part of our general investment account our general investment account consists of all assets owned by us other than those in the separate account and in our other separate accounts subject to applicable law we have sole discretion over the investment of the assets of our general investment account � we guarantee amounts allocated to the gpa in excess of any policy loan will accrue interest daily at an effective annual rate at least equal to  for amounts in the gpa equal to any policy loan the guaranteed minimum interest rate is an effective annual rate of  or if greater the policy loan rate less the loan interest rate expense charge this charge will not be greater than  per year interest will be credited at this rate regardless of the actual investment experience of the gpa although we are not obligated to credit interest at a rate higher than the guaranteed minimum we may declare a higher rate � the separate account � our board of directors established the separate account on july   as a separate investment account of massmutual the board established the separate account based on the laws of the state of massachusetts the

policies funded by the separate account we credit or charge the income gains or losses realized or unrealized of the separate account against the assets held in the separate account we do not take any regard of the other income gains or losses of massmutual assets in the separate account attributable to the reserves and other liabilities under the policies cannot be charged with liabilities from any other business conducted by massmutual we may transfer to our general investment account any assets that exceed anticipated obligations of the separate account � the funds � the investment funds available through the policy are offered by eleven investment companies and trusts they each provide an investment vehicle for the separate investment accounts of variable life policies and variable annuity contracts offered by companies such as massmutual shares of these organizations are not offered to the general public � the assets of certain variable annuity separate accounts offered by massmutual and by other affiliated and nonaffiliated life insurers are invested in shares of these funds because these separate accounts are invested in the same underlying funds it is possible that conflicts could arise between policyowners and owners of the variable annuity contracts � the boards of trustees or boards of directors of the funds will follow procedures developed to determine whether conflicts have arisen if a conflict exists the boards will notify the insurers and they will take appropriate action to eliminate the conflicts � we purchase the shares of each fund for the division at net asset value all dividends and capital gain distributions received from a fund are automatically reinvested in that fund at net asset value unless massmutual on behalf of the separate account elects otherwise we redeem shares of the funds at their net asset values as needed to make payments under the policies � some of the funds offered are similar to or are �clones� of mutual funds offered in the retail marketplace these �clone� funds have the same investment objectives policies and portfolio managers as the retail funds and usually were formed after the retail funds while the clone funds generally have identical investment objectives policies and portfolio managers they are separate and distinct from the retail funds in fact the performance of the clone funds may be dramatically different from the performance of the retail funds due to differences in the funds� sizes dates shares of stock are purchased and sold cash flows and expenses thus while the performance of the retail funds may be informative you should remember that such performance is not the performance of the funds that support the policy it is not an indication of future performance of the policy
