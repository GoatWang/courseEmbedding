mcvey was instrumental in the founding of marketaxess in april of  this week he talked with jln managing editor christine nielsen about increasing efficiencies in bond trading and growth at marketaxess  could you give me a quick rundown of your background and how you came to marketaxess mcvey prior to founding marketaxess in april of  i was managing director and head of north america fixed income sales at jp morgan overseeing the institutional distribution of fixedincome securities to investors through this and prior experience it became clear to me how greater efficiencies could be introduced to traditional bond trading which was a manually intensive process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties led by a group of the largest dealers in the fixed income market including jp morgan we created marketaxess in response to investors need for a single trading platform with easy access to multidealer competitive pricing in a wide range of credit products  how would you characterize the current financial industry landscape for marketaxess it appears the company just released some healthy q earnings  including record revenues of  million up  percent mcvey thank you we were very pleased to report a record quarter for the firm i would characterize credit market conditions through the first quarter as very healthy we have seen a combination of significant inflows into bond funds and opportunistic issuance by corporate treasurers which has led to strong trading activity in the primary and secondary markets us high grade trading volumes were up  percent from the fourth quarter and  percent from a year ago based on the finra’s trace data on bond market activity with low shortterm rates we have continued to see strong demand for credit due to the improving appetite for risk and continued demand for yield the results of the first quarter reflect not only favorable market conditions but also demonstrate robust growth in many product areas of our business in our core product  us high grade bonds  we have continued to grow our average market share to approximately  percent of trace volume driven by a combination of increased investor order flow and improved dealer hit rates in addition we have successfully broadened our customer participation on the system both in terms of market making dealers as well as institutional investor firms  based on your financial results it looks as if there has been particularly strong growth in the “other category what’s the driver behind that increase mcvey yes the strong growth in the other category which includes our newer products reflects the expansion in electronic trading of us agency debt and emerging market bonds where we saw record quarterly volumes we are excited about the increased traction of our agency business as we strive to be a single destination for our customers to trade credit on marketaxess for emerging markets bonds we are continuing to make headway in etrading adoption and have seen particular client demand for emerging market corporate bond trading which is representing a greater percentage of trading versus emerging market sovereign debt  what other areas of the market are you entering mcvey recently we have added to the platform the capabilities to electronically traded preferred stock and assetbacked securities the ability to trade these asset classes electronically are marketplace firsts and both fit well with the trading protocols for corporate bonds and our trading community at the same time we’ve continued to build our institutional trading network to  market making dealers and over  active institutional investor firms  marketaxess has said it hopes to create a swap execution facility sef once the rules are finalized could you tell us a little more about the intent there mcvey marketaxess continues to be focused on being the leading institutional credit marketplace which is why we are so excited about the opportunities that the regulatory reforms present the credit default swap electronic trading market fits hand in glove with what we’ve always done in the corporate bond market which is as true now as it was when we were the first to introduce a clienttomultidealer platform for cds over five years ago moreover throughout the last  years we have built the right network of institutional users and developed the best trading technology to allow them to trade in the spirit of what has been set forth by doddfrank we expect to qualify as a sef and are working to meet that objective and we have cds trading engines built for index singlename and bidoffer list trading while much uncertainty remains on the timing of implementation we continue to stay engaged with the regulators and market participants enhance our trading technology and build important connectivity to our customers prime brokers affirmation hubs and clearing houses  last month you announced several seflike electronic trades with jp morgan and six investor clients trading both singlename and index cds in the us and europe could you give some background on those transactions mcvey cds currently represents the largest investment we are making in product capabilities and those transactions were a good example of how the market is evolving some of the cds trades completed this quarter were submitted for electronic affirmation and central clearing a model for the new market envisioned by doddfrank regulatory reform although it remains unclear when the implementation of the new rules will take place we want to continue to demonstrate that we are taking all the steps necessary to provide electronic trading capabilities to our customers that will be aligned with tomorrow’s regulatory regime  how do you feel about how the regulatory process for the otc market has been handled thus far mcvey overall we are pleased with the otc derivative trading rules proposed by the cftc and sec throughout this commentary period they have demonstrated that they are listening attentively to all market participants and taking in their considerations as they shape the final rules certainly we have offered comments to both regulatory agencies and continue to be engaged with them among the concerns we have expressed are the regulatory and compliance requirements for sefs and securitybased sefs we are hopeful that the associated compliance costs will not prove overly burdensome as to discourage trading stifle innovation and limit competition as the regulatory rules are finalized marketaxess stands ready to provide technology solutions to our customers to help them comply with the new regulations  what do you feel is the greatest challenge that marketaxess faces at this time mcvey although the trade winds are currently in our favor in the us the market environment in europe remains a bit weaker due to the sovereign debt crisis however that has not held us back from enhancing our technology trading workflow and stp solutions to our european customers moreover we have seen substantial growth in the volume of north american products being traded by our european investor clients over the last few years we see an opportunity to grow the crossborder trading activity in both directions and continue to engage and connect our us clients to trade eurobonds with our uk marketmaking dealers
