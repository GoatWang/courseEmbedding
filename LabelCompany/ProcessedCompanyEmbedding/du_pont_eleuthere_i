engraving of eleuthère irénée du pont after a painting by rembrandt peale courtesy hagley museum and library apprentice to lavoisier pierre du pont was among those attempting moderate reforms to inequitable and inefficient institutions in the last years of the old regime and the early days of the french revolution he became friends with antoinelaurent lavoisier because of their similar political agendas and together they reorganized the royal gunpowder and saltpeter administration lavoisier one of the agency’s four directors soon hired pierre’s younger son eleuthère irénée to work in the essonne gunpowder factory where he learned how to manufacture gunpowder political exile during the french revolution the du ponts found themselves under attack not least because they had personally protected the king and queen from a mob besieging the tuileries palace in paris in  only changes in administration saved pierre from the guillotine in  the entire family left for the united states where they hoped to found a model community of french exiles—which never came to pass american gunpowder eleuthère irénée soon recognized a business opportunity in the poor quality of the gunpowder generally available in the united states and in  he set up a powder works on the banks of the brandywine river near wilmington delaware startup was difficult and despite significant growth during the war of  for the  years of his leadership he carried substantial debt including loans to pension the widows and orphans of  workers killed in a terrible explosion at the powder works in  he

american corporate elite and their representatives were central figures in organizing and funding the american liberty league the du pont family was so complicit in this fascist organization that james farley fdrs postmaster general and one of his closest advisors said the american liberty league ought to be called the american cellophane league because first its a du pont product and second you can see right through it donald r mccoy coming of age gerard colby in his book dupont dynasty outlines the familys pivotal role in creating and funding the league click here for an excerpt the dicksteinmccormack committee learned that weapons and equipment for the fascist plotters croix de feulike superarmy could be obtained from the remington arms co on credit through the du ponts du pont had acquired control of the arms company in  the du pont co formed in  by elèuthere irénée du pont de nemours dominated us gunpowder sales for more than a century elèuthere i du ponts father pierre samuel a french economist politician and publisher had helped negotiate the paris treaty to end americas revolution his rightwing views made french radicals very suspicious and they sentenced him to the guillotine somehow he and his son elèuthere were released and escaped to america where they arrived january   with a vast fortune to challenge englands domination of the global gunpowder trade napoleon helped ei du pont establish an american gunpowder business in  pierre returned to france and negotiated the french sale of about a million square miles of land to america louisiana purchase  meanwhile his son made his first gunpowder sales to a close family friend president thomas jefferson du pont produced only gunpowder they were the main supplier of this product during many wars including  war of  supplying the us against britaincanada  south american wars supplying both spain and bolivars republics  mexicanamerican war  supplying the us  indian wars  supplying manifest destinys genocidal westward expansion  crimean war  supplying both england and russia  us civil war  supplying the northern states  spanishamerican war  supplying the us  wwi  supplied all us orders  of the allies needs in  when they agreed with european competitors to divide up the world du pont got exclusive control of gunpowder sales in the americas by  du pont had assets of  million and controlled all us government orders du pont bought out  of its american competitors and closed most of them down  in  us antitrust laws created two competitors for du pont and in  the government ordered du pont to divest from some explosives production du pont then diversified into newspaper publishing chemicals paints varnishes cellophane and rayon wwi was particularly profitable du pont the worlds largest producer of dynamite and smokeless gunpowder made unheardof net profits of  million between the wars du pont was the worlds top manufacturer of explosives the worlds leading chemical company and the top producer of cars and synthetic rubber another strategic war material by the s it owned mexican and chilean explosive companies and a canadian chemical company although still the top us gunpowder supplier this product represented only  of its total production du ponts general motors co funded a vigilanteterrorist organization to stop unionization in its midwestern factories called the black legion its members wore black robes decorated with a white skull and crossbones concealed behind their slitted hoods this kkklike network of whitesupremacist thugs threw bombs into union halls set fire to labor activists homes tortured union organizers and killed at least  in detroit alone many of their victims were blacks lured north by tales of good autoplant jobs one of their victims rev earl little was murdered in  his son later called malcolm x was then six an earlier memory his first was a nighttime raid in  when the legion burnt down their house gerard colby had this to say about the black legion in his book dupont dynasty  but corporate executives did not give up the tactic of vigilante groups and on june   cowdrick wrote harry anderson gms labor relations director to ask his opinion of the sentinels of the republic anderson was apparently unaware of irénée du ponts support of this organization but offered his own homebrew alternative with reference to your letter of june  regarding the sentinels of the republic he replied a few days later i have never heard of the organization maybe you could use a little black legion down in your country it might help the black legion anderson referred to was indeed a great help to general motors in its struggle to prevent auto workers from unionizing with members wearing black robes and slitted hoods adorned with white skull and crossbones the black legion was the terror of michigan and ohio auto flelds riding like klansmen through the night in car caravans bombing union halls burning down homes of labor militants and flogging and murdering union organizers the organization was divided into arson squads bombing squads execution squads and anticommunist squads and membership discipline on pain of torture or death was strictly enforced legion cells filled gm factories terrorizing workers and recruiting ku klux klansmen since  the black legions power had permeated police departments the legion claiming  members in michigan was divided into distinct squads each focused on a different aspect of their work for du pont arson bombing execution and anticommunism the legions cells within gm factories intimidated workers targeted jews and recruited for the kkk they worked together to stop reds and unions that demanded their labour rights thanks to a senate munitions investigating committee  that examined criminal warprofiteering practices of arms companies during wwi the public learned that du pont had led munitions companies in sabotaging a league of nations disarmament conference in geneva the committees chair gerald nye said that once the munitions people of the world had made the treaty a satisfactory one to themselvescolonel simons of du pont is reporting that even the state department realized in effect who controlled the nation the du ponts fought back against widespread public condemnation that rightly labeled them merchants of death they claimed that communists were behind the senate hearings and blamed the committee for undermining us military power in response chairman nye a republican from north dakota pointing out that du pont had made six times as many millions of dollars during wwi than during the preceding four years so naturally mr du pont sees red when he sees these profits attacked by international peace the du pont co and particularly gm was a major contributor to nazi military efforts to wipe communism off the map of europe in  gm bought adam opel germanys largest car manufacturer in  a senate subcommittee on antitrust and monopoly heard evidence from researcher bradford snell proving that that in  gm opened an opel factory to supply the nazis with blitz military trucks in appreciation for this help adolf hitler awarded gms chief executive for overseas operations james mooney with the order of the german eagle first class besides military trucks germanys gm workers also producing armored cars

hitlers principles he keenly followed the future fuhrers career in the s on sept   in a speech to the american chemical society he advocated a race of supermen to be achieved by injecting special drugs into them in boyhood to make their characters to order he insisted his men reach physical standards equivalent to that of a marine and have blood as pure as that in the veins of the vikings despite the fact that he had jewish blood in his own veins his antisemitism matched that of hitler in outright defiance of roosevelts desire to improve working conditions for the average man gm and the du ponts instituted the speedup systems these forced men to work at terrifying speeds on the assembly lines many died of the heat and pressure increased by fear of losing their jobs irénée paid almost  million from his own pocket for armed and gasequipped storm troops modeled on the gestapo to sweep through the plants and beat up anyone who proved rebellious he hired the pinkerton agency to
