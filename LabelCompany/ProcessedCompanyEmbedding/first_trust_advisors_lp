blog home send us your comments and questions rss feed   existing home sales declined  in june posted under data watch • home sales • housing  implications  existing home sales took a breather in june giving up ground as median prices reached a new record high for the second consecutive month  sales of previouslyowned homes fell  in june to a  million annual rate but are still up  from a year ago  going forward it is important to remember that home sales are volatile from month to month but we expect the general upward trend of the past several years to keep going  that being said tight supply and rising prices remain headwinds  inventories have now fallen on a yearoveryear basis for  consecutive months and are down  from a year ago  inventories are now the lowest for any june since at least the late s  this has also affected the months supply of existing homes – how long it would take to sell the current inventory at the most recent sales pace – which was  months in june down from  months a year ago  according to the nar anything less than  months is considered tight supply a benchmark which hasnt been exceeded since november   the good news is that demand for existing homes in june was so strong that  of listings were on the market for less than a month  higher demand and a shift in the mix of homes sold toward more expensive properties has also driven up median prices which have now risen for  consecutive months on a yearoveryear basis and reached a new record high in june  the strongest growth in sales over the past year is heavily skewed towards the most expensive homes signaling that supply constraints may be disproportionately hitting the lower end of the market  tough regulations on land use raise the fixed costs of housing tilting development toward higherend homes  the nar suggests that strong demand could also be pushing some properties into higher brackets as multiple offers boost final sales prices  although some analysts may be concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates its important to recognize that rates are still low by historical standards incomes are growing and the appetite for homeownership is eventually going to move higher again    click here for pdf version posted on monday july     pm • post link share   printer friendly   moderate growth for q since the start of the economic recovery in mid real gdp has grown at an average annual rate of   the second quarter of this year doesnt look much different  our calculations suggest real gdp grew at a  annual rate in q exactly the same as the consensus forecast thats an acceleration from the  pace in q and we expect better growth ahead but consistently better growth is going to take more than lots of talk from washington dc  instead its going to take some concrete steps like less regulation lower tax rates less spending and a more freemarket approach to health care        heres how we get to  for q consumption  automakers reported car and light truck sales dropped at a  annual rate in q  real inflationadjusted retail sales outside the auto sector grew at a  rate but growth in services was strong in part due to a rebound in seasonallyadjusted utility output after unusually mild weather in january and february  our models suggest  real personal consumption of goods and services combined grew at a  annual rate in q contributing  points to the real gdp growth rate  times the consumption share of gdp which is  equals  business investment  after clicking on all cylinders in q business investment grew more modestly in q  investment in business equipment and intellectual property both grew at about a  rate but commercial construction fell at about a  pace  combined it looks like they grew at a  rate which should add  points to the real gdp growth   times the  business investment share of gdp equals  home building  while boosting utilities in q the return to more normal weather patterns dampened home construction  home building looks like it grew in q but at a  annualized pace rather than the  pace in q  the trend is somewhere between the two and we expect continued growth in this sector even if mortgage rates rise as more jobs and faster wage growth will lead to more demand for housing  in the meantime a  growth rate will add  points to the real gdp growth rate   times the home building share of gdp which is  equals  government  both military spending and public construction projects look close to trend in q  on net were estimating that real government purchases were up at a  annual rate in q which would add  points to the real gdp growth rate   times the government purchase share of gdp which is  equals  trade  at this point we only have trade data through may  based on what weve seen so far it looks like net exports should subtract  points from the real gdp growth rate in q   inventories  we have even less information on inventories than we do on trade but what we have so far suggests companies are stocking shelves and showrooms at a slightly faster pace in q than they were in q which should add  points to the real gdp growth rate keep in mind that there are reports on durable goods as well as international trade and inventories the day before the gdp release and those figures could change our forecast as well  but for the time being you can put it all together and get an estimate of  for q  no one should be excited or dismayed by this report  it is the epitome of the plow horse pace of growth weve had for the past eight years   hopefully washington will now get its act together and make this one of the last plow horse reports we have to see brian s wesbury  chief economist robert stein cfa – deputy chief economist   click here for pdf version posted on

link share   printer friendly   housing starts increased  in june posted under data watch • home starts • housing  implications  after falling for three consecutive months housing starts rebounded strongly in june beating the consensus to post their largest monthly gain of the year  even though both singlefamily and multiunit starts were responsible for the gain in junes headline number in the past year singlefamily starts are up  while multiunit starts are down   the mix of construction has been generally shifting toward singlefamily building and this is a good sign for the overall economy  when the housing recovery started multifamily construction led the way but the share of all housing starts that are multifamily appears to have peaked in  when  of all starts were multifamily the largest since the mids when the last wave of baby boomers was growing up and moving to cities in june the multifamily share of starts was   the shift toward singlefamily is a positive sign for the economy because on average each singlefamily home contributes to gdp about twice the amount of a multifamily unit  based on population growth and scrappage housing starts should eventually rise to about  million units per year in other words much of the recovery in home building is still ahead of us  another bright spot in todays report was that housing completions rose  in june and are now up  in the past year  further building permits for new structures posted their biggest one month jump since  in june  expect housing starts to continue to gain steam in the months ahead as more unfinished projects are completed and builders move onto new ones  in other recent housing news the nahb index which measures sentiment among home builders fell to a still elevated  in july from  in june  expect further strength in the housing sector in the year ahead as more jobs faster wage growth and for at least the time being optimism about more marketfriendly policies from the trump administration continue to encourage both prospective home buyers and builders  on the factory front the empire state index a measure of manufacturing sentiment in new york fell to a still healthy  in july from  in june finally on inflation import prices fell  in june but are up  from a year ago  export prices also fell  in june but have increased  in the past year  both figures are a stark contrast to the negative direction of prices in the year ending in june    click here for pdf version posted on wednesday july     am • post link share   printer friendly   m and ci loan growth posted under government • fed reserve  source st louis federal reserve fred database posted on monday july     pm • post link share   printer friendly   hey government its time to get serious posted under government • monday morning outlook • spending • taxes at eight years the current economic recovery is the third longest on record  personal income consumer spending household assets and net worth are all at record highs  stock markets are at record highs  corporate profits are within striking distance of their alltime highs  federal tax receipts are at record highs  so how is it possible that the federal budget along with some state and local budgets still look like theyre in the middle of a nasty recession the answer government fiscal management is completely out of control  politicians find time to fret about amazons purchase of whole foods and wont stop bashing banks but theyve lost their ability to deal with their own fiscal reality the federal government is projected to run a nearly  billion deficit this year and longterm forecasts suggest trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see  illinois and the city of chicago are running chronic deficits while new jersey and new york are fiscal basket cases this makes the politicians of the s look downright responsible  in  after a year recovery these entities were all running surpluses but even if this recovery lasts  years deficits will persist  and what happens if theres another recession politicians have claimed intellectual support for their fiscal irresponsibility from john maynard keynes  he believed in deficitspending to help cure the problems of weak consumer spending in a recession  as a result the panic of  gave cover to grow government and they did so in spectacular fashion  but that emergency spending then morphed into permanent overspending and chronic deficits tax rates are higher today than in  and the economy is bigger but governments have consistently outspent the ability of taxpayers to fund it even keynes thought the government should roll back spending and get budget deficits under control in better economic times  but politicians are long past seeking his intellectual support  they love to lecture businesspeople about greedy human nature yet cant turn that analysis on themselves businesses and entrepreneurs create new things and build wealth  politicians redistribute that wealth  and while some of what government does can help the economy like providing defense or supporting property rights the us government has expanded well beyond that point  politicians have never been this reckless or fiscally irresponsible whenever we say this people ask what would you cut from the budget  and then if you are actually brave enough to answer you get attacked for not caring this needs to stop  illinois is in a death spiral  tax rate increases will chase more productive people out of the state while ratcheting spending higher  and just like detroit and puerto rico the state will go bankrupt the us government is on this path but because it has the ability to fund itself with the best debt in the world a true fiscal day of reckoning is still  years away government spending needs to be peeled back everywhere  its no longer a case of picking and choosing  and until that happens the fiscal irresponsibility of the government is the number one threat to not only america but the world no matter what politicians tell us any pain caused by private sector greed will pale in comparison to the mayhem that collapsing governments can create  just look at venezuela or greece  its time to reset americas fiscal reality  and if that means debt ceiling brinksmanship shutting down the government or moving to a simple majority on spending decisions so be it  its time to get serious brians wesbury  chief economist robert stein cfa – deputy chief economist   click here for pdf version posted on monday july     am • post link share   printer friendly   industrial production rose  in june posted under data watch • industrial production  cap utilization  implications  industrial production rose for the fifth consecutive month in june beating consensus expectations and signaling an uptick in activity across the board  the headline measure for industrial activity rose  in june and is now up  from a year ago  manufacturing which excludes mining and utilities bounced back in june rising   this gain was primarily due to a  jump in the volatile auto sector though core industrial production which is manufacturing excluding autos rose  as well  manufacturing has begun to accelerate recently up at a  annual rate in the past three months versus a gain of  in the past year  and this isnt just due to auto production either both core and auto manufacturing are showing similar accelerating patterns in the past three months versus their year ago measures  another major contribution to todays headline number came from mining which jumped  in june and is now up at an  annual rate in the past three months versus  in the past year  further oil and gaswell drilling posted its thirteenth consecutive gain in june jumping  and is now up a massive  at an annual rate in the past three months  based on other commodity prices we think oil prices are below fair value range but with oil companies profitable at current prices mining should stay in recovery after the problems of the past two years click here for pdf version posted on friday july     am • post link share   printer friendly   retail sales declined  in june posted under data watch • retail sales  implications   retail sales were soft again in june but dont take that as a sign consumer spending is rolling over or the economy as a whole is getting weaker  total retail sales slipped  in june and half of the drop in overall sales was due to lower gas prices this normal volatility causes retail sales to drop three or four months during a year even in a growing economy  core sales which exclude autos building materials and gas were also down   in spite of the weak month for the second quarter as a whole core sales were up at a healthy  annual rate versus the first quarter consistent with our forecast that real inflationadjusted consumer spending on goods and services combined rose at about a  annual rate as well  this is not a sign of a dying consumer  even with the  decline in total retail sales in june theyre still up  from a year ago which is outstripping the  increase in the consumer price index  note that one area of continuing strength is among nonbrick and mortar retailers where sales rose  in june are up  from a year ago and now make up  of sales the largest portion on record  expect a rebound in retail sales in the months ahead  the fundamental trends that drive growth in consumer spending continue to look good  these include healthy job growth wage growth and very low consumer financial obligations relative to historical norms although household debt is at a record high household debts are the lowest relative to household assets since the peak of the internet boom almost  year ago  in other news this morning business inventories increased  in may  plugging this into our forecast suggests real gdp grew at a  annual rate in the second quarter a little faster than the  average since the economic recovery started in mid   click here for pdf version posted on friday july     am • post link share   printer friendly   the consumer price index was unchanged in june posted under cpi • data watch • inflation  implications  consumer prices were unchanged in june and have been tame over recent months but cries that a lull in inflation should give the fed pause are overblown  consumer prices are up  in the past year compared to a  increase in the twelve months ending june  and a  increase for the period ending june   in other words inflation is still in a rising trend  energy prices fell  in june while food prices were flat  strip out the typically volatile food and energy components and core cpi rose  in june and is up  in the past year  medical care and rent costs led core prices higher in june rising  and  respectively more than offsetting declining prices for autos  we expect rents to accelerate in the year ahead as supply constraints get tighter in the housing market  meanwhile energy prices should stop falling and rebound a bit  combined these forces should push the cpi back above  around the end of the year  the best news in todays report is that real average hourly earnings rose  in june  these earnings are up  over the past year up at a  annual rate over the past six months and a  annual rate over the past three  this acceleration signals that a loose monetary policy has led to a tighter labor market  because the fed believes in the phillips curve the trend of accelerating price and wage gains should have fed officials focusing more on the potential for inflation to rise faster than desired as the jobless rate continues to fall below their longterm target  thats why we expect the fed to stick to their plan of starting to unwind the balance sheet while also raising rates one more time in   click here for pdf version posted on friday july     am • post link share   printer friendly   the producer price index rose  in june posted under data watch • government • inflation • ppi • fed reserve • interest rates  implications  services sector prices pushed the producer price index higher by  in june and prices are up a healthy  in the past year  within the service sector prices for final demand services less trade transportation and warehousing in other words services like healthcare lodging and banking led the index higher rising  in june  goods prices also ticked higher in june with food prices rising  offsetting a  decline in energy prices  take out the volatile food and energy sectors and you are left with core prices which rose  in june following a  rise in april and a  increase in may and have risen  in the past twelve months  with both headline and core producer prices hovering around the feds  inflation target and both measures easily above  when looking at the annualized rate over the past three and six month periods there should be little doubt that balance sheet unwinding and further rate hikes are warranted  a look further back in the pipeline at prices for intermediate demand suggests inflation pressures are continuing  while intermediate processed goods prices declined  in june they are up  in the past year and have increased in eight of the last ten months  meanwhile prices for intermediate unprocessed goods rose  in june and are up  over the last twelve months  the fed will keep these prices which give a hint to the direction final demand prices will follow in future months in mind as they plan the path for monetary policy  news out this morning on the feds other key area of focus employment showed that initial jobless claims fell  last week to   meanwhile continuing claims declined  to  million  its early but taking these together suggests healthy job creation continues in
