whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise now i’d like to turn the call over to adelene adelene perkins thanks jaren good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us on today’s call particularly those of you who are battling today’s northeastern blizzard we’re particularly pleased with the progress we’re making with ipi the first and only selective pikinase gamma inhibitor in clinical development our phase  study in patients with advanced solid tumors is enrolling ahead of schedule we’re maintaining strong fiscal discipline and we have an experienced team in place that’s executing with the great sense of urgency to deliver meaningful data within our twoyear cash runway ph today we’ll review our progress in advancing ipi and also review our full year  financial results we had a number of key accomplishments last year that position us to make important progress this year last november our preclinical data which established the objective for our ongoing clinical study were reported in backtoback publications in nature we also entered a clinical trial collaboration with bms for the supply of opdivo a pd immune checkpoint inhibitor for the combination component of our study which we initiated in december enrollment in this first combination cohort was completed in january and we are well on our way to completing enrollment in the second combination cohort we’re excited about ipi because it represents a unique immunooncology approach by reprogramming macrophages within the tumor microenvironment converting them from a protumor to an antitumor phenotype our preclinical data which we’ll review momentarily provides compelling rationale for our phase  study and underscores the potential for ipi to serve as the backbone for a wide spectrum of combination therapies for the treatment of solid tumors the phase  study is evaluating ipi both as a monotherapy and in combination with opdivo in a broad range of patients with advanced solid tumors the primary objective of this study is to establish the safety profile of ipi as a monotherapy and in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor we’re very encouraged by the tolerability of ipi at doses that provide near complete suppression of pikinase gamma as no patients have discontinued treatment due to drug related side effects todate the chronic dose escalation phase of the study evaluating ipi as a monotherapy and in combination is very important because it enables us to learn about the safety pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics profile of ipi and determine optimal doses to evaluate in our expansion cohort through this expansion cohort we will generate additional data from monotherapy treatment and also from combination of ipi and opdivo in specific types of solid tumors including nonsmall cell lung cancer melanoma and head and neck cancer we had the honor of presenting our preclinical and early clinical data in peer reviewed forum that enable us to share our findings and exceed ph that from highly regarded scientists and clients less than two months ago at the plenary session of the pikinase keystone symposia we presented a summary of our recent publication in nature along with the phase  data from the first nine patients previously presented at the aacr triple meeting in new york last september additionally an update of the phase  monotherapy data were presented in a plenary session at the international congress on targeted anticancer therapies or tat last week and we’re looking forward to sharing updated data from ongoing monotherapy module as well as an initial data from this combination doseescalation module at the aacr annual meeting next month these data will be reviewed during both an oral education session on saturday april st and in a poster session on tuesday april th we are also focusing an event for the investment community on saturday evening april st during which time study investigators will be available to speak about their experience treating patients with ipi as we look ahead we expect to make progress in following three key areas this year first we will complete our monotherapy and combination doseescalation module we anticipate completing the monotherapy doseescalation in the first half of the year and the combination doseescalation in the second half of the year second we will begin enrolling patients in both the monotherapy and combination expansion cohort in the second half of  and third we will report updated phase  data throughout the year first at the aacr annual meeting next month and then in a peer reviewed forum in the second half of  before we provide a more detailed review of ipi i’d like to highlight the promotion of two key people to our executive leadership team claudio dansky ullmann our senior vice president of clinical development and jeff kutok our chief scientific officer claudio has led our clinical development team since joining the company in  he has more than  years experience in developing medicine at takeda as well as at the national cancer institute during this time claudio participated in and led numerous earlyphase and latephase clinical trials including studies evaluating treatments for lung and head and neck cancers melanoma and other solid tumors his extensive work at the nci focused on immunooncology and drug resistance jeff kutok has played an instrumental role in overseeing our biology and translational science efforts since joining infinity in  including leading the infinity team that advanced ipi platform in the clinical development and coauthored our recent backtoback publications in nature on pikinasegamma and ipi his experience in translational research and in the medical pathologist at harvard medical school and brigham and women’s hospital is a perfect complement to our clinical team and with these introductions i’m going to turn the call over to jeff to summarize our preclinical data followed by claudio who will review our clinical study it’s been pleasure to work with jeff and claudio and we look forward to their continued contributions in advancing ipi jeff kutok thanks adelene and good afternoon everyone our discovery of ipi provides us the unique and exciting opportunity to be the first to explore the potential therapeutic benefit of this highly selective pik gamma inhibitor through research collaborations with colleagues at the university of california san diego and memorial sloan kettering we’ve learned that pikgamma is highly expressed in tumorassociated macrophages and that the blockade of pikgamma signaling by treatment with ipi results in reprogramming macrophages this reprogramming shifts macrophages in the tumor microenvironment from the m or protumor phenotype to the m or antitumor phenotype and increases the number of tcells that attack the tumor and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in terms of activity observed preclinically we’ve demonstrated dose dependant single agent antitumor activity in multiple solid tumor models including models of lung cancer melanoma head and neck cancer colon cancer and breast cancer additionally in preclinical models treatment with ipi in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor showed a greater tumor growth inhibition and improved survival rates including a greater number of complete tumor regressions when compared to treatments with either ipi or the checkpoint inhibitor alone the combination treatment is often a longlasting antitumor immune memory as evidenced by the lack of tumor growth upon rechallenge with the same tumor in the absence of any treatment while it’s encouraging to observe the synergistic activity of ipi with checkpoint inhibition resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy represents another challenge our preclinical data demonstrates that increased protumor m macrophages are associated with resistance to checkpoint inhibitor monothreapy and treatment with ipi in combination with checkpoint inhibitors is be able to overcome this resistance by reprogramming macrophages from the m protumor phenotype to the m antitumor phenotype the key takeaways from our preclinical findings are as follows first inhibition of pikgamma plays a key role in reprogramming tumor associated microphages second we’ve demonstrated monotherapy and combination activity of ipi in multiple preclinical models of cancer and third we’ve shown that treatment with ipi can overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibition this collected value research represents important contributions to the field of immunooncology on april st i will review our ipi program during an oral educational session at the aacr annual meeting it is an honor to be invited to share our innovative chemistry preclinical research and clinical data in this forum and i hope to see many of you there our preclinical discoveries provide the foundation for our ongoing clinical study phase  of ipi which i will now turn to claudio to review in more details claudio dansky ullmann thank you jeff i’m really pleased to update you on our progress with ipi there is a growing need for treatment options for patients who do not respond to current immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors even when there is an initial response to checkpoint blockade resistance often subsequently develops given our preclinical data demonstrated that ipi can overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade i’m very excited about where we stand today and what we could accomplish in the future while it’s still early days i want to share with you a few reasons i believe in the therapeutic potential of ipi why our investigators have been so supportive and why our study has been progressing ahead of schedule first ipi is the first and only selective pikinasegamma inhibitor in the clinic the unique mechanism of action or reprogramming macrophages to create a more favorable tumor like environment and facilitate an antitumor immune response makes ipi a great partner for combination with today’s immunotherapies second the preclinical data supporting this first in class therapy provides a compelling rationale for our ongoing phase  study third as once daily oral therapy ipi is easy to administer and fourth the safety profile todate is excellent and no patients have discontinued treatment due to drug related adverse events this phase  study is designed to determine the safety recommended phase  dose and activity of ipi in approximately  patients the study includes four distinct modules which i will now review the first module is a monotherapy doseescalation phase in patients with advanced solid tumors this first module allows us to define the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic of ipi as we’re determining ph a recommended single agent phase  dose we have completed patient enrollment in five doseescalation cohorts evaluating once daily doses of ipi ranging from  milligrams to  milligrams we’re extremely pleased with the safety pk and pd data observed todate we near ph complete suppression of pikinasegamma no serious drug related side effects have been observed no dose limiting toxicities have been reported no patients have been continue to treatment due to drug related side effects and the maximum tolerated dose has not been reached this monotherapy safety data represents a significant derisking for our product based on our pk and pd data which showed significant suppression of pikinasegamma at  milligrams once daily we felt confident in initiating the second module of our study early last december the goal of the second doseescalation module is to demonstrate that ipi on opdivo can be safely combined and to establish a recommended phase  dose of this combination we initiated the first combination cohort of  milligrams ipi plus the standard regimen of opdivo we completed the enrollment in the first combination cohort in january and have already enrolled the majority of patients in our second cohort evaluating  milligrams ipi with opdivo demonstrating the safety of this combination represents a key derisking event for the product and will enable us to more formally test the efficacy of this combination in the disease specific expansion cohorts our monotherapy and combination expansion cohorts represent the third and the fourth modules of our study module three our monotherapy expansion cohort provides an opportunity to generate more simulation data in a greater number of patients with a variety of solid tumors  advanced solid tumors since this is an indiscernible cohort we also have the opportunity to learn about all additional potential indications for ipi the fourth module will evaluate ipi in combination with opdivo in patients with specific types of cancer including nonsmall cell lung cancer melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in addition the enrollment to the disease specific cohort we serve for patients that have demonstrated initial resistance or those initial responded but subsequently t developed resistance to checkpoint therapy this fourth module is a direct test of whether ipi can overcome checkpoint resistance as demonstrated in preclinical models and translation ph translational research will be critical to helping us better understand how ipi works in patients and within current future studies to that end i want to emphasize that pretreatment and ontreatment biopsies are mandatory for all expansion cohorts so that we can better understand the tumor indiscernible patients who respond and identify biomarkers of response and resistance we are pleased to share the initial data from our monotherapy in combination dose escalation modules at the aacr annual meeting next month as jeff mentioned he will review our ipi program during an oral educational session on saturday april st which will include an overview of our clinical program then we will provide a more detailed review of our clinical data during the poster session on tuesday april th while our abstract is indiscernible until march st we can tell you that we are planning to provide an update on  patients in module one our monotherapy dose escalation as well as at least six patients in module two our combination dose escalation the presentation will be focused on safety pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data i look forward to seeing many of you at aacr and to sharing additional clinical updates with you at medical meetings in the second half of  now larry will review our  financial results larry bloch thank you claudio what you’ve heard from the infinity team is a great deal of enthusiasm for ipi which is really compelling science the excitement of advancing potential firstinclass oral therapy and the tremendous support of our investigators we expect the data for  and have the financial resources to complete all core modules of our clinical study within our current cash runway which extends into the first quarter of  i’ll now summarize our financial results for the full year  revenue during  was  million and was related to our previous collaboration agreement with abbvie duvelisib revenue during  was  million all of which related to the abbvie collaboration in  we also recorded a nonrecurring gain on abbvie’s optout of duvelisib collaboration of  million this nonrecurring gain represents the remaining deferred revenue of  million as of june   from the previous collaboration with abbvie for duvelisib the abbvie optout is irrevocable and we have no further obligations to continue to provide abbvie with any services additionally we did not recorded any gains during  rd expense for  of  million compared to  million for  the decrease in rd expense yearoveryear was primarily related to a  exercise option payment to takeda our restructuring activities and the reduction in clinical development expenses for duvelisib general and administrative expense was  million for  compared to  million for  the yearoveryear increase in ga expense is primarily due to restructuring activities net loss for  was  million or a basic and diluted loss per common share of  compared to net loss of  million or a basic and diluted loss per common share of  for the same period of  at december   we had total cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities of  million compared to  million at december   and wondering  million at september   i’ll also review the  financial guidance that we provided in january and it remains unchanged we expect net loss for  to range from  million to  million and we expect to end  with a yearend cash and investment balance ranging from  million to  million based on current operating plans we expect our existing cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities at december   will provide cash runway into the first quarter of  our cash runway expectations exclude additional funding or business development activities we are off to a very strong start in  and expect to make continued progress in our phase  study throughout the year we look forward to providing updated data from our clinical study next month at aacr as well as additional data updates throughout the year as we pursue our goal of bringing considerable benefit to patients we hope to see many of you at aacr meeting in just a few weeks and now we are happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of anupam rama from jp morgan your line is open unidentifiedanalyst hey guys this is eric in for anupam this afternoon i hope you guys are staying warm and dry thanks for taking the question claudio you noted expectations of presenting data from six patients from the opdivo combination at aacr is that inclusive patients who would be available to read this responses in addition to initial safety pkpd and i have followup claudio dansky ullmann yes so as you recognize the key focus on the doseescalation as we explore the combination is safety because that’s the key issue that we’re going to be able to say that it’s  we have a valuable combination to move forward obviously we’re going to look into particular signals depending on what type of patients we get and what they have been  the prior exposure to checkpoint inhibitors in that particular cohort and also usual responders or not or expected to respond or not to checkpoint so we may be looking at that type of activity but i think we should emphasize that that should not be the focus in terms of the doseescalation and that it should be mainly efficacy hopefully we will have at least a very  or stronger readout once we move forward with the expansion cohorts in very defined tumor types adelene perkins eric in the dose escalation it’s all comers so that we don’t have the homogeneity of patients in the tumor type though have progress on the pd at the recommended phase  dose so as claudio outlined the modules one and two are really about safety and three and four get to efficacy unidentified analyst got it i guess sort of with the initial focus here still being around dosing short of reaching and mtd what measures are you looking to kind of establish or solidify a biologically affected dose with  both as monotherapy but also in combating with opdivo thanks adelene perkins so joe pearlberg is going to take that question dr joe pearlberg thanks adelene so short of an mtd for both the monotherapy as well as the combination dose escalation arms of the study we’re going to really look at the totality of all the data which will include safety tolerability the pk and pd data to make a decision for each of those respective cohorts with respect to recommended phase  dose operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of katherine xu from william blair your line is open katherine xu yes hi good afternoon i’m just wondering what is the expected toxicity of  and does that include potential ph or any other adelene perkins yes so katherine we’ll just remind you that to date we haven’t seen any side effects and that will be discussed in more detail in the upcoming aacr presentation but joe can share with you what was presented at the last aacr meeting in september on that dr joe pearlberg yes thank you adelene so at the presentation in september of  we presented data on nine patients and what reported at that time there were no drug related saes there were no dlps and most of the adverse events have been low grade that is grade one grade two and in fact going back to even further the preclinical data package really did not suggest anything concerning in terms of toxicity and since this is a firstinclass compound ipi in targeting the gamma isoform in pik is distinct it’s unique from the other isoforms we are very well aware of the sideeffect profile that’s associated with inhibiting the delta isoform of pik we’re also aware of the side effect profile of inhibiting the alpha isoform of pik and i’ll also add our investigators are really well experienced in the field of immunooncology and we are very keen with regard to the expected toxicity of the immunotherapeutic agents and we’re going to present a complete safety profile of ipi in a couple of weeks at the aacr meeting which we look forward to katherine xu great and then from the preclinical data or the data that you’ve seen so far in the clinic can you see  could convert pdl negative tumors to the positive towards that direction and also when you talk about overcoming resistance anti pd can you  are there any characterization of those resistance for example is this reverse refractory are there any expectations on those and then are there any differential activities against a potential different phenotypes that we look for adelene perkins jeff can take that one jeff kutok yes this is jeff let me start by answering your second question with respect to the overcoming of resistance in our preclinical models the models that we looked at that were resistant to checkpoint inhibition had a very unique phenotype and it was that they were very rich in m tumor associated macrophages and we showed that that there was a differential sensitivity between sensitive and insensitive tumors depending on the level of the m macrophages and we subsequently showed that in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor ipi was able to effectively reverse the m to m ratio and subsequently activated an antitumor tcell response so the preclinical data points to a myeloid rich tumor which would potentially be insensitive to checkpoint inhibition so this is something that as claudio alluded to we’re going to be actively pursuing it in the clinic and answer to whether  can reverse this resistance and your first question could you repeat it for me please katherine xu to convert pdl that gets to pdl positive jeff kutok yes so it’s an interesting question to often  the response of a tumor to increasing pdl is mediated through interferon gamma responses it’s an adaptive resistance sort of concept on the two parts ph put forward and we have shown that there is an increase in gamma interferon reduction preclinically with  treatment and we have shown that there is an increase in pdl expression in the tumors in our preclinical study so it’s possible that in the clinic we will increase the pdl levels on tumors with  treatment operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of mike king of jmp securities your line is open unidentified analyst good afternoon thank you for taking my call this is patrick for mike king i just have some quick questions regarding upcoming data so what data point should investors be most watching for and how should investors think about the success of  thank you adelene perkins so the most important data in the first module the dose escalation of our phase  study is the tolerability and determining the recommended phase  dose to take into the expansion cohort as well as be able to look for efficacy particularly in the combination with opdivo more homogeneous patient population and those cohorts will begin in the second half of this year claudio dansky ullmann and to add to that we’re going to present the pharmacodynamic data that is clearly showing how at least in the issues we are mentioning how we’re achieving meaningful suppressive concentrations of our target so i think that’s very relevant as we move forward unidentified analyst okay also about duvelisib i know it’s licensed to verastem but maybe you can remind us how the trial is set up for superiority to ofatumumab and what is milestone payment associated with it thank you adelene perkins sure patrick so the duo trial which is evaluating duvelisib versus ofatumumab has a pfs endpoint and that trial is now being run by verastem if the trial is successful they will owe us a  million milestone and then subsequently if the file and have an nda accepted a  million milestone operator thank you operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of jim birchenough from wells fargo securities your line is open unidentified analyst hi thanks for taking our questions this is yanan ph in for jim so first of all for the aacr data presentation i’m wondering if we are going to see data for the biomarker for m m conversions from tumor biopsies adelene perkins so i would just turn it over claudio to answer i’ll just remind you that we’re not collecting the biopsies until we get to the expansion cohort phase claudio dansky ullmann yes so to complement that so basically the answer is no because we’re not mandating biopsies at this point either for monotherapy dose escalation or for the combination dose escalation so we will not have that data to present unidentified analyst great thanks and you mentioned that you have achieved a near complete inhibition of pikgamma have you talked about at which  what dose level that occurred claudio dansky ullmann yes i can comment and then joe can complement so we’ve been  as we move forward in the different dose escalation we’ve been doing almost as much as possible realtime assessment so as we said in our initial remarks we already see meaningful suppression at  milligrams in the monotherapy dose escalation and then we are obviously following the same story for  milligrams and we’re waiting for  milligrams data but basically we can say confidently that we’re achieving good levels of suppression even at  milligrams now as joe was referring earlier once we have the complete dataset of all the dose escalation cohorts we will look at the totality of the data and see how that perform in the interest of stability in the suppression unidentified analyst great last two quick questions one is you mentioned enrollment was ahead of schedule could you talk about whether that’s true for both the monotherapy portion in addition to the combination portion also have you gotten certain kol feedback after you presented the data at tat thanks dr joe pearlberg i’ll answer the first part of the question and the answer is yes for both the monotherapy and combination dose escalation arms enrollments is ahead of schedule and now i’ll turn to claudio with regard to the investigator feedback from the tat conference claudio dansky ullmann so at tat one of our  the main enroller actually tony tolcher data in the oral session and also jedd wolchok presented some of the rationale in his award lecture and we had very positive feedback from investigators in relation to what they saw in terms of the data where we’re with the program and the potential directions where the program could go as we move forward is that the question you’re asking unidentified analyst yes adelene perkins and then i think both the enthusiasm from tat and to joe’s response about enrolling ahead of schedule it’s we believe due to some of the reasons claudio mentioned earlier that it’s an easy to administer oral drug it’s been welltolerated for any who are interested in this whole m to m reprogramming we have  it’s the pikinasegamma inhibitor in development and for patients who progress on the checkpoint inhibitor there are few options so we think there are a lot of sustainable reasons why that’s true for both the monotherapy arm and the combination arm of the trial claudio dansky ullmann and also as measure for you regarding enrollment as you recognize with all the competition from different trials and different combinations the fact that we opened the enrollment for the combination cohort kind of in middecember we were  we completed enrollment of the six patients by the first half of january this year so i think that speaks to the robustness or strong support that we get from investigators about our trial operator thank you and at this time i’m showing no further questions i’d like to turn the call back over to adelene for closing remarks adelene perkins thanks amanda we’re looking forward to presenting our data at aacr in washington dc and hope to see many of you there along with our ipi study investigators at our investor event on saturday evening april st please market on your calendars and jaren will followup with the details we hope

and now i’d like to turn the call over to adelene adelene perkins thanks jaren good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us on today’s call we are very pleased with the adv advancements we’ve made with ipi our oral selective pikinase gamma inhibitor today we’ll discuss our progress with the phase i clinical study of ipi in patients with advanced solid tumors and also review our first quarter  financials technical difficulty okay this is adelene perkins from infinity pharmaceuticals we are very sorry about the technical difficulties but we will begin right at the beginning of our prepared remarks again and remind you that the forwardlooking that jared madden had read they are still in impact so we would appreciate for having you on today’s technical difficulty including check point inhibitors there is also a significant medical need for patients who do respond and then subsequently develop resistance to their immune therapy regimen given our preclinical data demonstrating that ipi can overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade coupled with the clinical data recently presented at the aacr annual meeting we are encouraged about the potential of ipi to address these medical needs another reason we are enthusiastic about our ipi is based on our published preclinical research which demonstrates that selectively targeting pikinase gamma represents a novel immunoncoloogy approach by reprogramming macrophages within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment converting them from a protumor to an antitumor phenotype while many immune therapies that are approved or are in development target tcells there are few approaches in development target macrophages and as a first and only selective pikinase gamma inhibitor in the plant we have an opportunity to develop a first in class therapy which by virtue of its distinct effect on macrophages may uniquely compliment and enhance the activity of other therapies our preclinical data which jeff will review momentarily provided compelling rationale for our phase i study and underscores the potential for ipi to serve as a cornerstone in a broad range of combination therapies for the treatment of solid tumors our ongoing phase i trial is evaluating ipi alone and with opdivo a pd immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with a broad range of advanced types of cancer the study includes four phases or module first mono therapy dose escalation second combination therapy dose escalation third monotherapy expansion and fourth the combination therapy expansion dose escalation modules i and ii are critical to accessing the safety of ipi and our ongoing as we work to determine optimal doses to evaluate in our expansion module to expansion modules three and four we expect to generate clinical data on the activity of ipi in solid tumors including a nonsmall cell lung cancer melanoma and head and neck cancer we are pleased with the dose escalation data recently presented at aacr which demonstrated the ipi was well tolerated as a monotherapy and in combination with opdivo the data which claudio will review in more detail show that there were no dose limiting toxicities or serious drugrelated side effects and no side effects led to treatment discontinuation as we look ahead we expect to make progress in the following three key areas this year first we’ll complete enrollement in our two doseescalation module and determine our recommended phase  doses we anticipate finishing the monotherapy dose escalation in the first half of the year and a combination module in the second half of the year second we’ll begin enrolling patients in our expansion modules in the second half of  and third we’ll report additional data in a fair review form in the second half of this year overall we are very pleased with the progress we’ve made and are continuing to make with ips while maintaining strong fiscal discipline our experienced team is executing with a great sense of urgency to deliver meaningful data within our current cash runway now jeff will review the preclinical rationale for studying ips in solid tumors jeff kutok thanks adelene and good afternoon everyone technical difficulty publications in the general nature late last year we worked with collaborators at the university of california san diego and memorial sloan kettering to explore the importance of targeting pikgamma and cancer in contrast to the other major pik isoforms pikgamma is highly expressed in tumorassociated macrophages and plays an important role in the protumor function of these cells we discovered that blockade of pikgamma signaling by treatment with ipi results in a transcriptional reprogramming of tumor associated macrophages this reprogramming shifts macrophages in the tumor microenvironment from the m or protumor phenotype to the m or antitumor phenotype increasing the number of t cells that can attack the tumor and increasing the production of proinflammatory molecules this was an important finding because there has been a great interest in targeting tumor associated macrophages to augument antitumor responses in terms of preclinical activity we demonstrated dose dependent single agent anti tumor activity in multiple solid tumor models particularly indiscernible that are rich in macrophages reinforcing the mechanism of action of ipi additionally in preclinical models treatment with ipi in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor showed greater tumor growth inhibition and improved survival rates including a greater number of complete tumor aggressions when compared to treatment with ipi or the checkpoint inhibitor alone the combination treatment resulted in long lasting anti tumor immune memory as evidenced by the lack of tumor growth upon rechallenge with the same tumor in the absence of any further treatment while the synergy between ipi and checkpoint inhibitors was encouraging resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy represents another challenge our preclinical data demonstrated that increased protumor m macrophages are associated with resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy and treatment with ipi in combination with checkpoint inhibitors can overcome this resistance through its effect on macrophages the key preclinical findings which lead the foundation of our clinical program are first pikgamma has a very different biology than other pik isoforms an innovation of the gamma isoform in macrophages affects the critical switch that we program as macrophages from the protumor to the anti tumor phenotype second we’ve demonstrated the activity of ipi in multiple preclinical models of cancer and third we’ve shown that ipi can enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors as well as overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors in cancer models importantly our ongoing phase i study is a faithful indiscernible of this preclinical research and claudio will now review our clinical program in more detail claudio dansky ullmann first i’m really pleased with our progress with ipi in the clinic this afternoon i will review the design of our ongoing phase i study and summarize a data we presented at the aacr annual meeting last month the objective of this study is to determine the safety recommended phase  dose and activity of ipi given orally once daily as monotherapy and combination with opdivo in approximately  patients with advanced solid tumors as adelene mentioned the study includes four distinct phases or modules the first two modules are dose escalations and the third and fourth modules represent expansion phases of the study module one is evaluating the safety durability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile of ipi as monotherapy we have completed patient enrollment in five cohorts evaluating doses ranging from  milligrams to  milligrams we are now enrolling patients in a cohort to evaluate the  milligram dose we expect to complete enrolment in this module and determine a recommended single agent phase  dose in the first half of this year based on our monotherapy pk and pd data which showed significant suppression of pikinasegamma of  milligram we initiated more then two the role of this module is to demonstrate that ipi and opdivo can be safely combined and to establish the recommended phase  dose for this combination currently module two includes two cohorts evaluating ipi at  milligrams and  milligrams combined with the standard regimen of opdivo we expect to complete this module in the second half of the year our expansion cohorts represent a third and fourth modules of our study module three is design to asses the monotherapy activity of ipi in a greater number of patients with a variety of advanced solid tumors module four will evaluate the activity of ipi in combination of opdivo in patients with specific types of cancer including nonsmall cell lung cancer melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck importantly enrollment to the diseasespecific cohorts is reserved for patients who have demonstrated the initial resistance or who initially responded but subsequently develop resistance to checkpoint therapy this feature of module four is a direct test of whether ipi can overcome checkpoint resistance as demonstrated in our clinical research values in nature additionally first clinical research will be critical to helping us better understand how ipi work in patients and will inform our future studies to that end we have mandatory pretreatment and ontreatment biopsies in all expansion cohorts so that we can better understand effect of ipi on tumors the tumor characteristics of patients who respond and biomarker response of resistance we anticipate starting module three and four in the second half of the year in april we reported that at from our tumor rule in a poster session at aacr annual meeting this data were from a march   data cutoff monotherapy data from  evaluable patients treated with doses of ipi ranging from  milligrams to  milligrams demonstrated that ipi was well tolerated no dose limiting toxicities or serious drug related side effects occurred and no side effect led to treatment discontinuation or dose reduction the pk and pd properties of ipi appear favourable with near complete and sustained inhibition of pikgamma at doses at or above  milligram which supports ones daily dosing additionally preliminary from six evaluable patients demonstrated that  milligram of ipi in combination with opdivo was well tolerated no dose opdivo limiting toxicities or serious drug related side effects occur and no side effect led to treatment discontinuation furthermore the combination did not result a new or unexpected side effects relating to the nonmonotherapy safety profile of each treatment the pk profile of the opdivo ipi in combination with opdivo appeared favourable as suggested that opdivo does not affect the pk properties of ipi overall the data we reported give us cohorts in the profile of ipi demonstrating a favourable tolerability profile for monotherapy and combined with opdivo is a significant milestone for the program and will enable us to more formally stress the activity of ipi in our expansion models we are please with the progress we are making and we look forward to providing an update in the second half of  now larry will review our financials results for the quarter larry bloch thank you claudio the infinity team is a very enthusiasm about ipi which had the attributes of the type of medicine and it seek to advance with the novel mechanism action and thoughtful clinical strategy to demonstrate the potential impact of this unique mechanism action addressing significant medical needs and in resolving our fiscal discipline we are in strong position to complete all four modules of our clinical study within our current cash runway extend into the first quarter of  at march st  we had total cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities of  million compared to  million at december   cash used for operating activities during the first quarter of  included  million of payments related to our  restructuring activities if we did not report any revenue during the first quarter  revenue for the first quarter  was  million all which related to the previous abbvie collaboration for duvelisib rd expense for the quarter was  million compared to  million for the same period last year the decrease in rd expense was primarily related to a decrease in clinical development expenses for duvelisib in addition to the companys  restructuring activities general and administrative expense was  million for the first quarter compared to  million for the same period last year the decrease in ga expense was also primarily related to  restructuring activities net loss for the first quarter of  was  million or a basic and diluted loss per common share of  compared to a net loss of  million or a basic and diluted loss per common share of  for the same period last year our  financial guidance that we provided in january remains unchanged we expect  net loss to range from  million to  million and we expect in  the cash invested balance ranging from  to  million based on its current operational plans which exclude additional funding or business development activities we anticipate our existing cash and cash equivalents at march   provide cash runway into the first quarter of  as i mentioned earlier our cash runway allows us the time to generate safety and activity data from all four modules who are ongoing phase  study of ipi overall we’re very pleased what achieved in so far this year and expect continue progress throughout  look forward to keep you update on infinity as we see to bring considerable benefit to patients and now we’re happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions at this time i’m showing no questions pardon me our first question comes katherine xu from william blair your line is now open unidentified analyst hi this is adriane ph for katherine and thanks for taking my question in the past you’d mentioned that you’ve seen meaningful suppression of pikinase that  mgs and higher i was wondering if you had any more color on the differences that you’ve seen so far between  and  and other doses adelene perkins so thank you adriane that is data that we get presented aacr and perhaps claudio can address the different doses claudio dansky ullmann yes the common is that we are very pleased to see already of  milligrams based on our essay formation gamma suppression that we were in that effective already effective suppressive concentration as we move up in the dose obviously we see that there is some room for more sustain innovation of our demo target as we move up in the dosing and that’s what we see it’s very incremental but the good thing is that all above the target of the percent innovation that we are looking at lease to think that that will have clear translation into what we called that ipi is doing in suppressing the target i don’t know if jeff kutok our cso would want to comment on that jeff kutok no i think claudio that definitely summarizes it unidentified analyst and what are you are for your recommended phase  claudio dansky ullmann so we’re looking honestly to the totally of the data so not only how the pk and pd performance characteristics are and obviously the safety and we will look at all the data the integral package if you want and based on that we will decide right now as we mentioned we’re enrolling or certainly enrolling to  milligram cohort and then we will look at that data once we have all the patient enrolled and we’ll decide based on this parameters how high we want to go obviously it will depend if we see dlp story we see that we have well within an optimal biological dose that we think can move forward that would be the general assessment very standard on its own unidentified analyst and do you see going higher than  the combo dosing claudio dansky ullmann can you repeat that sorry unidentified analyst do you foresee possibly going higher than  milligrams in combination with opdivo claudio dansky ullmann well it’s a possibility but we’ll have see we presented data they share  milligrams and we’re right now evaluating the  milligrams cohort and again looking at the totality of the data we’ll decide if we can go out or if we want go out to  milligrams in combination unidentified analyst great thank you operator and at this time i’m showing no further questions i’d like to turn the call back over adelene for closing remarks adelene perkins thanks bruce we’re excited about the opportunity we have with ipi and our team is working hard to rapidly advance to our phase  study we look forward to providing additional updates on infinity throughout the year and hope you’ll all have a good evening and thank you for joining us on

sciences center and the massachusetts biotechnology council she is the vice chairman of the board of project hope about pad enzymes and autoimmune disease padlock’s founding hypothesis is that autoimmune disease can result from the aberrant production of neoantigens materials not normally expressed during homeostatic health and as a consequence recognized as foreign by the immune system these antigens drive both the initiation and the subsequent development of disease by inducing maturation of the immune response once disease is established antigen production fuels inflammatory cycles in affected organs and drives the formation and deposition of immune complexes which account for much of the morbidity and mortality in patients with autoimmune disease therefore in patients where the source of neoantigen is known extinguishing antigen production offers the potential to impact disease progression and intensity without affecting systemic immunity the proteinarginine deiminases pads are a family of enzymes that posttranslationally modify arginine side chains on proteins to the nonencoded amino acid citrulline in some patients these citrullinated proteins are immunogenic therefore pad enzymes may be responsible for producing the antigens that drive disease in these individuals inhibiting pads in these patients may provide an innovative and orthogonal approach for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis and other destructive autoimmune diseases about padlock padlock therapeutics is a private cambridge massachusettsbased biotechnology company dedicated to creating new medicines to treat destructive autoimmune diseases the company leverages breakthrough science on the biochemistry of the
