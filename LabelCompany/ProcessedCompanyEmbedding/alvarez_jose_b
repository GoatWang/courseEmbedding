texture and appearance of a traditional beef hamburger a previous iteration of this product had been taste tested live with good results and sergey brin a cofounder of google had provided post with much of the funding to make the burgers the next step was to form an independent company around this technology and take it to market this innovative product could both radically disrupt the existing beef production and supply chain and provide an animal welfare and environmentallyfriendly food that had far less of an environmental impact than traditional beef products post faced several challenges in making this a commercially viable product though he had to get price down as it currently cost roughly  to make a single burger he also had to find the right partners to help him bring the product to market but who should he work with someone from the established beef production and supply system a retailer or someone entirely outside the traditional beef system how could he expect established companies to react to this disruption of the status quo messaging around this product was critical how should post communicate with the public to convey that this was a natural product—the
