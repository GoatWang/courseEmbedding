unchecked is projected to result in significant loss of life ampliphi has the opportunity to be a meaningful player in addressing this looming public health crisis”about antibiotic resistancedecades of misuse and overuse of antibiotics has led to the rise of multidrugresistant and panresistant bacteria commonly known as “superbugs” these superbugs threaten to render existing antibiotic therapies useless potentially thrusting the world into a “postantibiotic” era where common infections may be life threatening hospitals regularly expose vulnerable patients to pathogenic bacteria according to the world health organization each year hundreds of millions of patients worldwide suffer from infections acquired in a hospital setting the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that drugresistant bacteria cause at least  million infections per year in the us alone resulting in over  deaths and many more people die from other conditions that are complicated by antibioticresistant infections the  o’neill report commissioned by the uk government projects that the failure to respond to the threat of antibiotic resistance and the rise of superbugs could lead to an estimated  million deaths per year from antibioticresistant infections worldwide by  with an accumulated global cost of  trillion and a  reduction in global gdpread moreabout bacteriophagesbacteriophages or more simply “phages” are the natural predators of bacteria and are thought to be the most abundant life form on earth over eons phages have evolved an incredible diversity of specialist strains that typically prey upon just one strain of bacteria enabling phage therapies to precisely target pathogenic bacteria while sparing the beneficial microbiota phages can infect and kill bacteria whether they are antibioticresistant or not and even when they have formed protective biofilmsabout ampliphi biosciencesampliphi biosciences corporation is a biotechnology company pioneering the development

place is sacred to all  abrahamic faith traditions muslim jewish and christian and muslims fears that israel wants it for their own religious and national purposes are unfortunately well grounded tel aviv wants to wrest control of it back for israel because in jewish religious traditions the building of the rd temple will herald the beginning of the messianic age israeli prime minister knew that the optics of the metal detectors and forbidding anyone under  to worship at al aqsa would be horrific but in his characteristic hubris he just didnt give a damn through these actions he may well have lit the flames for yet another intifada then he will use this violence as the justification to tighten down the screws against palestinians even more than they are already i weep for all those dead and wounded jewish muslim and christian and those who will die and be wounded on all sides this is an absolute tragedy which could have been averted a violent response to these strictures for
