imports in the world platts jkm™ is thus a key reference in marking product valuemarket price from supply source to the destination market in the lng market space traditional patterns of trade are evolving fast where cargoes once changed hands only through opaque bilateral deals the market now exhibits open sell and buy tenders for multiple and single cargoes brokered trades cargoes sold in longer chains and speculative trading positions taken up by nontraditional players adding to liquidity on the spot market the platts jkm™ price assessment is available in these services how do we

trades during our moc assessment process every day evolution of platts jkm™ price assessment see less   platts was the first to launch daily lng price assessments for cargoes trading in asia starting with platts jkm™ in february  as global supply and market participation grow the uptick in liquidity of spot trading has seen the platts jkm™ being increasingly used as a price reference for trades both in and outside asia spot trades generally represent around  of the lng volumes traded yearly while the lng market continues to be dominated by traditional  to year longterm contracts there is a marked movement towards shorter term and spot deals longterm contracts expose both buyers and sellers to market risks as price fluctuations cannot be captured daily spot prices mitigate this risk by representing actual market value for the product bought and sold each day making the inherent market volatility both visible and understandable new entrants into the lng market are pushing for shorter term and spot deals instead of the traditional longterm agreements therefore there is a need to establish a reliable transparent and repeatable marker to reflect the fair and transactable value of the spot lng market a role the platts jkm™ assessment serves with increasing nonassociated gas production and shale gas development the call to move away from oilindexation together with delinking lng prices from other commodities becomes more prominent as such platts jkm™ sees its presence continue to grow in the physical market alongside its gradual integration into physical contracts platts jkm™
