platforms such as xbox live arcade playstation network or psn and steam and prior to  ios and android mobile devices and online platforms our video game titles are targeted at various demographics at a range of price points due to the larger budget requirements for developing and marketing premium console titles for core gamers we have focused on publishing more lowercost games targeting casualgame consumers in some instances our titles are based on licenses of wellknown properties and in other cases original properties we enter into agreements with content providers and video game development studios for the creation of our video games our operations involve similar products and customers worldwide these products are developed and sold domestically and internationally the company is centrally managed and our chief operating decision makers the chief executive and other officers use consolidated and other financial information supplemented by sales information by product category major product title and platform for making operational decisions and assessing financial performance accordingly we operate in a single segment since october  we have implemented reductions of our workforce to reduce our fixed costs the reductions include development and gametesting selling and marketing and support personnel we are currently not developing any significant new games for release in fiscal  and are evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize company value including the merger with or acquisition of a new business which may be in a different business than our current and historical operations on december   we completed a private placement of up to  million of units at a purchase price of  per unit each unit consists of one share of the companys  series a convertible preferred stock and a five year warrant to purchase one share of the companys common stock at an initial exercise price of  per share see liquidity and capital resources below we have received  million of proceeds from the private placement the release from escrow of an additional  million of proceeds is subject to approval of our shareholders for the full conversion of the preferred shares and conversion of the warrants and satisfaction of certain other conditions including the completion of a qualified transaction or approval of the lead investor in the private placement a qualified transaction may involve the acquisition of a business that is not related to our current operations described in this report see liquidity and capital resources  private placement video game products net revenues our revenues are principally derived from sales of our video games we provide video games primarily for the mass market and casualgame player our revenues are recognized net of estimated provisions for price protection and other allowances when we act as an agent in the distribution of games developed by others we recognize revenue net of the share of revenue due to the developer in the form of wholesale price royalties andor distribution fees cost of sales cost of sales consists of product costs and amortization and impairment of software development costs and license fees a significant component of our cost of sales of packaged games is product costs product costs are comprised primarily of manufacturing and packaging costs of the disc or cartridge media royalties to the platform manufacturer and manufacturing and packaging costs of peripherals commencing upon the related products release capitalized software development and intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales gross profit gross profit is the excess of net revenues over product costs and amortization and impairment of software development and license fees development and license fees incurred to produce video games are generally incurred up front and amortized to cost of sales the recovery of these costs and total gross profit is dependent upon achieving a certain sales volume which varies by title product research and development expenses product research and development expenses have historically related principally to our cost of supervision of third party video game developers testing new products development of social games and conducting quality assurance evaluations during the development cycle that are not allocated to games for which technological feasibility has been established costs incurred have been primarily employeerelated may include equipment and are not allocated to cost of sales ongoing research and development activities have been substantially reduced since fiscal  selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist of marketing and promotion expenses sometimes including television advertising the cost of shipping products to customers and related employee costs credits to retailers for trade advertising are a component of these expenses general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily represent employee related costs including stock compensation for corporate executive and support staff general office expenses professional fees and various other overhead charges professional fees including legal and accounting expenses typically represent one of the largest components of our general and administrative expenses these fees are partially attributable to our required activities as a publicly traded company such as sec filings and corporate and businessdevelopment initiatives interest and financing costs interest and financing costs are directly attributable to our factoring and our purchaseorder financing arrangements such costs include commitment fees and fees based upon the value of customer invoices factored income taxes income taxes consists of our provisionbenefit for income taxes as affected by our net operating loss carryforwards future utilization of our net operating loss or nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code the annual limitation may result in the expiration of nol carryforwards before utilization due to our history of losses a valuation allowance sufficient to fully offset our nol and other deferred tax assets has been established under current accounting pronouncements and this valuation allowance will be maintained unless sufficient positive evidence develops to support its reversal seasonality and variations in interim quarterly results our quarterly net revenues gross profit and operating income from sales of packaged software are impacted significantly by the seasonality of the retail selling season and the timing of the release of new titles sales of our catalog and other products are generally higher in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year ending january  and october  respectively due to increased retail sales during the holiday season sales and gross profit as a percentage of sales also generally increase in quarters in which we release significant new titles because of increased sales volume as retailers make purchases to stock their shelves and meet initial demand for the new release these quarters also benefit from the higher selling prices that we are able to achieve early in the products life cycle therefore sales results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for subsequent quarters during the fiscal year critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our product when when we enter into license or distribution agreements that provide for multiple copies of games in exchange for guaranteed amounts revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the agreements generally upon delivery of a master copy assuming our performance obligations are complete and all other recognition criteria are met or as percopy royalties are earned on sales of games price protection and other allowances we generally sell our products on a noreturn basis although in certain instances we provide price protection or other allowances on certain unsold products in accordance with industry practices price protection when granted and applicable allows customers a partial credit with respect to merchandise unsold by them revenue is recognized net of estimates of these allowances sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for benefits received such as the appearance of our products in a customers national circular advertisement are generally reflected as selling and marketing expenses we estimate potential future product price protection and other discounts related to current period product revenue in addition some of our software products are sold exclusively as downloads of digital content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met our provisions for price protection and other allowances fluctuate over periods as a result of a number of factors including analysis of historical experience current sellthrough of retailer inventory of our products current trends in the interactive entertainment market the overall economy changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period however actual allowances granted could materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing products for example the risk of requests for allowances may increase as consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures additionally the reduction in the scope of our game operations and elimination of games in development for future release could have an impact on our relationship with retailers while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change this will result in a change in our provisions which would impact the net revenues andor selling and marketing expenses we report fluctuations in the provisions reflected our estimates of future price protection based on the factors discussed above we limit our exposure to credit risk by factoring a portion of our receivables to a third party that buys without recourse for receivables that are not sold without recourse we analyze our aged accounts receivables payment history and other factors to make a determination if collection of receivables is likely or a provision for uncollectible accounts is necessary capitalized software development costs and license fees software development costs include development fees primarily in the form of milestone payments made to independent software developers software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and management expects such costs to be recoverable against future revenues for products where proven game engine technology exists this may occur early in the development cycle technological feasibility is evaluated on a productbyproduct basis amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to product research and development costs commencing upon a related products release capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales based upon the higher of i the ratio of current revenue to total projected revenue or ii straightline charges over the expected marketable life of the product prepaid license fees represent license fees to holders for the use of their intellectual property rights in the development of our products minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property licenses are initially recorded as an asset capitalized license fees and a current liability accrued royalties payable at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract or when specified milestones or events occur and when no significant performance commitment remains with the licensor licenses are expensed to cost of sales at the higher of i the contractual royalty rate based on actual sales or ii an effective rate based upon total projected revenue related to such license capitalized software development costs are classified as noncurrent if they relate to titles for which we estimate the release date to be more than one year from the balance sheet date the amortization period for capitalized software development costs and license fees is usually no longer than one year from the initial release of the product if actual revenues or revised forecasted revenues fall below the initial forecasted revenue for a particular license the charge to cost of sales may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter the recoverability of capitalized software development costs and license fees is evaluated quarterly based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate when in managements estimate future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized costs we expense these capitalized costs to cost of sales  loss on impairment of capitalized software development costs and license fees  future releases in the period such a determination is made these expenses may be incurred prior to a games release if a game is cancelled and never released to market the amount is expensed to operating costs and expenses  loss on impairment of capitalized software development costs and license fees  cancelled games if we were required to write off licenses or capitalized software development costs due to changes in market conditions or product acceptance our results of operations could be materially adversely affected license fees and milestone payments made to our third party developers are typically considered nonrefundable advances against the total compensation they can earn based upon the sales performance of the products any additional royalty or other compensation earned beyond the milestone payments is expensed to cost of sales as incurred we expense as research and development costs associated with the development of mobile and social games when we cannot reliably project that future net cash flows from developed games will exceed related development costs these games have not earned significant revenues to date and we are continuing to evaluate alternatives for future development and monetization inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method we estimate the net realizable value of slowmoving inventory on a titlebytitle basis and charge the excess of cost over net realizable value to cost of sales some of our inventory items are packaged with accessories the purchase of these accessories involves longer lead times and minimum purchase amounts which may require us to maintain higher levels of inventory than for other games therefore these items have a higher risk of obsolescence which we review periodically based on inventory and sales levels accounting for stockbased compensation stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including in the case of stock option awards estimating expected stock volatility in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted commitments and contingencies we record a liability for commitments and contingencies when the amount is both probable and reasonably estimable we record associated legal fees as incurred results of operations three months ended january   versus three months ended january   net revenuesnet revenues for the three months ended january   decreased approximately  to  million from  million in the comparable quarter last year the decrease was due to lower sales of zumba titles including a decrease in zumba revenue from europe in the prioryear period we released zumba world party and zumba kids we did not release a new zumba title in the currentyear period overall zumba sales accounted for  of revenues in the prioryear period in addition since january   we have substantially reduced development and distribution activities for packaged software generally and released fewer titles in the current period revenues from games distributed digitally increased to  compared to  the same period last year primarily due to the release of costume quest  and slender the arrival on various digital platforms including steam sony playstation network and microsoft xbla gross profit gross profit for the three months ended january   was  million compared to a gross profit of  million in the same period last year the decrease in gross profit reflects lower zumba and other sales as discussed above gross profit as a percentage of net sales was  for the three months ended january   compared to  for the three months ended january   the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the portion of total revenues represented by revenues from digital distribution which has a higher gross margin relative to sales due to the lack of cost of physical goods distribution such distribution fee revenue in the prior year period was not significant in the prior year costs of sales included significant higher amortization of software development costs of zumba product research and development expenses product research and development expenses were less than  million for the three months ended january   compared to  million of expenses for the same period in  reflecting the effects of workforce reductions in  and limited spending on thirdparty development projects selling and marketing expenses total selling and marketing expenses were approximately  million for the three months ended january   compared to  million for the three months ended january   decreases primarily due to lower personnel costs and other marketing and distribution activities related to the companys games generally in addition the prioryear period included advertising costs related to the release of zumba games general and administrative expenses for the threemonth period ended january   general and administrative expenses amounted to  million compared to  million for the three months ended january   the decrease reflects lower compensation costs consulting and professional fees and related support expenses operating loss operating loss for the three months ended january   was approximately  million compared to an operating loss of  million in the comparable period in  primarily reflecting expense reductions in development and marketing activities loss from equity method investment we recorded a loss of approximately  million in the three months ended january   for our  share of losses incurred by our gms joint venture in the period we sold our investment in gms in november  accordingly there was no effect of gms operations on the currentyear period extinguishment of liabilities during the three months ended january   the company recognized a gain on extinguishment of liabilities of  million the company determined that certain accounts payable balances and claims for license fees and services would never be paid because they were no longer being pursued for payment and had passed the statute of limitations there was no such activity in the prioryear period net gains on asset sales during the three months ended january   the company recognized a  million net gain from the sale of certain game rights and from the sale of office furniture and equipment upon the move to a smaller office there was no such activity in the prioryear period change in fair value of warrant liability in our december  private placement of units consisting of preferred stock and warrants we issued warrants containing certain contingent settlement terms not indexed to our own stock we account for the warrants as derivative liabilities and will remeasure their fair value on a quarterly basis and recognize on a current basis any gains or losses in the three months ended january   we recognized a loss of  million reflecting an increase in our stock price from the issuance date of the warrant to january   income taxes in the three months ended january   and  our income tax expense was not significant representing primarily minimum state income taxes liquidity and capital resources as of january   our cash and cash equivalents balance was  million and our working capital was approximately  million compared to cash and equivalents of  million and working capital of  million at october   the increase in cash primarily reflects the sale of inventory and collection of accounts receivable in the three months ended january   in addition we received approximately  million of net proceeds from our december  private placement of units and received cash proceeds from the sale of certain games in development and the sale of our interest in gms in recent quarters we have generally used cash and working capital balances to fund periodic operating losses due to declining revenues which we attribute to three factors  the introduction of
