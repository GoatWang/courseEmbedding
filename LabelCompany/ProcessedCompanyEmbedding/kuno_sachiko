assistant role in  at sachiko kuno and ryuji ueno’s bethesda office — a small twobedroom condominium — she listened to ueno explain the science behind his work with “a sparkle in his eyes” she remembers the recent college graduate would be the first fulltime employee for a startup that would become sucampo pharmaceuticals inc she knew little about science but enough from the doctors’ fervor and ambition to recognize they were “working on something special” and they were they had made a major medical discovery and launched an antiglaucoma treatment in japan where they had established drug company rtech ueno ltd they moved to the dc area in  because of its proximity to the fda and rich pool of researchers and industry talent hoping to avoid the challenges of initially commercializing new medicines outside of the us they would found sucampo as rtech ueno usa inc in  and later bring to market their second product a treatment for chronic constipation they would take sucampo public in  making it an international player in the pharmaceutical industry before contently walking away from it in  enlarge dr sachiko kuno president  ceo dr ryuji ueno honorary chair sr foundation… more joanne s lawton they would leave their mark but they wouldn’t leave washington the tycoons had another project in the works back in  they created the sr foundation a dcbased nonprofit that supports artists scientists and social entrepreneurs it sponsors award programs engages community partners and hosts concerts to encourage innovation it was their brainchild living largely under the radar the researchers — kuno a biochemist now  and ueno a medical doctor now  — took the foundation from its infancy developing its mission growing its programming and staff and capitalizing on opportunities to expand its impact after more than a decade with sr in the district in  the husbandwife team made a splash in the georgetown real estate market when they purchased two historic mansions first the evermay estate for  million then the halcyon house for  million more recently in june they bought george washington university’s fillmore school building for  million now the very private philanthropists were in the spotlight today the sr foundation comprises nine programs providing performance opportunities residency programs and three main awards the ueno award for health care sciences the kuno award for applied sciences and the washington award which sponsors talented artists then there’s the anchor project the halcyon incubator it follows an unusual model providing residencies for individuals pursuing enterprises that prioritize measurable social change in a month fellowship in each cohort eight fellows — selected from an applicant pool of  — live together in the halcyon house a mansion built in  by us secretary of the navy benjamin stoddert the fellows have a “robust community built around them” sr foundation chief operating officer kate goodall said in conceiving the idea she and kuno consulted leaders in the social enterprise field to create a program “that would be additive and not duplicative” the fellows are provided the space to live and work a  stipend mentors and coaches they have access to pro bono services from legal to accounting to communications to business development ninetythree percent have raised some kind of funding and a number have raised more than  million unlike many other incubators goodall said sr doesn’t take equity in any ventures but helps “give those people a leveled playing field to launch from and greater support so that they can reach further and be bolder be more confident” in  the sr foundation has brought in about  million in revenue with about  million in expenses  percent of which funded its programs and  percent of which went toward supporting services according to goodall donor contributions directly fund its programs while the founders and existing assets cover overhead and general operational costs she said and the financial future of the foundation looks promising the couple’s ability to support and continue to contribute is supported by their collective  percent ownership of sucampo according to the company’s most recent proxy — nearly half of a biotech that boasted a  million market cap as of nov  the doctors who live in upper northwest attribute their love of historic homes to spending time around those in kyoto japan where they met and lived for more than  years before moving to the dc area “historic houses have some sort of power to inspire young talented people we believe” kuno said so the team decided to preserve and repurpose them now they’re continuing to expand this residency footprint with the fillmore school which will serve civicminded artists as sr’s second incubator with a “similarly robust system of support” goodall said “art is the center of the project” kuno said “that means how art can create social impact to change the world to make the community better” at evermay which the doctors opened to predominantly showcase musicians sr hosts a concert series as well as chamber and solo performances now with a person staff sr supports roughly  individuals a year in addition to those involved with special collaborations through other organizations like the washington ballet a new partner this year char prescott has experienced this support firsthand as the  recipient of the washington award an annual honor the foundation presents to an aspiring visual artist dancer photographer musician filmmaker or writer a few months after prescott won the award the current cellist in “the president’s own” marine chamber orchestra received a call from the doctors asking if she could perform lastminute in place of an injured artist at the kennedy center’s terrace theater it was her childhood dream “they had not heard me live yet” prescott said “they decided to take a chance and give me the opportunity” the thenyearold met kuno and ueno for the first time backstage  minutes before her performance she found them waiting for her afterward with flowers their handson generosity is constant prescott said when she needed a better cello ueno quietly traveled to new york and identified one he believed would suit her prescott got a call to visit the music shop “i was just blown away by the cello he had chosen” prescott said “he just had this sense of the essence that i would want out of an instrument” the organization owns the cello and prescott plays it on loan an arrangement from which other sr artists also benefit she remains involved with the foundation giving concerts recitals or showcase performances with other musicians or playing in a relaxed setting for instance sometimes ueno invites the artists to come over have wine and read chamber music together she said “so many people just write a check and walk away and that’s not what they do” prescott said “they truly want to see the artists blossom and grow and they will do whatever they can to help make that happen” the foundation also fosters artistic relationships and cross cultural collaborations “not only do they bring all of these different performers in with different backgrounds” prescott said “but they encourage us to meet and spend time together and collaborate and create ideas” the couple’s dedication to the arts has deep roots to their scientific training ueno has his md from keio university school of medicine in japan as well as two doctorates he has studied pharmacology physiology and biochemistry at kyoto and osaka universities in japan and columbia and stanford universities in the us kuno earned her doctorate in biochemical engineering from kyoto university in japan and completed post doctoral research at the technical university of munich in germany they met in the mids working together in the lab long before they were married kuno realized her love for the visual arts when visiting museums during college in kyoto ueno grew up watching his father support string instrument players hoping to “do something similar to support the artists” if he could he said sr doesn’t draw distinctions between fields in the way it supports people goodall said the doctors “recognize that people that are sort of pushing the envelope in any of those fields or trying to do something new need to have the time and space to think and breathe and try new innovative things” kuno and ueno have no desire to slow down no intention to leave the dc area and no plans to purchase more real estate — yet they hope to continue growing the sr model they enjoy time with their two golden retrievers mario and cherry ueno — formerly a class a racecar driver — collects and restores old cars some may wonder why the doctors are so powerfully drawn to the arts but art has “a healing power it’s almost like a medicine” said tolliver who stayed with sucampo for  years in various capacities worked with sr and is now an attorney “i believe the sciences and arts have some similarity in terms of the creation or creativity” ueno said “in order to do some invention or research work the same portion of the brain may be used to create good art

profile the three decisions of sachiko kuno volume  – issue no – spring  by david everett photographs by marco javier   now in her halcyon days the ceo turned philanthropist adds another chapter to a life story of entrepreneurial success   if you are listed as one of the world’s most powerful women if you are developing one of the nation’s most innovative foundations if you are managing hundreds of millions of dollars how else would you relax but frolic with your dog such is sachiko kuno softspeaking entrepreneur scion of a pharmaceuticalturnedfoundation empire and playmate of cherry the energetic golden retriever extraordinary people are still and again people and dog wrangling is an easy choice for an introvert like kuno who once chose to work in a chemistry lab because she thought the job would not require human interaction yet from the quiet of that longago lab kuno would transform into the business brains behind the genius of a bossturnedhusband along that other path she would immigrate from a nation where she wasn’t accepted buy and rebuild one of washington’s most historic homes and become a citizen of a new country today the marriage over kuno has turned her acumen in development finance and innovation to a new endeavor in philanthropy the mission at dc’s halcyon house and at kuno’s other enterprises is the same as with the healthsaving drugs she helped develop to improve the residents of the blue planet through innovative science art finance discourse and social enterprise halycon is to synergize these disparate fields “i believe scientists artists and business entrepreneurs have some similarities” kuno reflects “they all need to communicate with their communities to showcase their talents … we need more of this getting together with everyone who has the vision who has the mission or who has the talent by creating a more inspirational space”  leaving home to see japan from her georgetown office sachiko kuno need only glance left from her desk chair to a long narrow landscape painting of modern hints and darkened tones a calming countryside view of hills and trees rising from a broad meadow she put that painting there at her side a reminder she hardly needs as the country kuno only recently in life’s terms began to visit again as the country she had to formally leave behind when she became a us citizen just last year japan is never far from mind when kuno needs to be alone – as she still does — she will slip into her kitchen at home and make a simple traditional japanese meal adorning her marveled life with memories of years far and past what better way to recollect your immortalities than cooking and smelling and tasting the foods of childhood she was born in japan in  the country still recovering from the devastation of world war ii the middle of three children sachiko grew up in a nontraditional family in a traditional land respectful of art science and business her engineer father and collegeeducated mother set examples sure her mother would remain a homemaker as was expected for japanese women but she taught sachiko and her sister about the freedoms she didn’t have outside the home “my mother was very much a dreamer” sachiko remembers “i have been very much influenced by her to see some dreams to think big even though my father is more down to earth it’s quite a good combination for parents” the interior design at the historic halcyon house is muted modern and intended to showcase the striking art handpicked by sachiko kuno sachiko chose a future in science for a reason “you can’t believe it now but i was supershy when i was a high school student i did not want to talk or communicate with other people by selecting my profession i wanted to get into some area where i didn’t need to communicate with other people and science — the lab — was one of those professions” japan then and still malecentered wasn’t welcoming to a woman in science yet first her sister and then sachiko came to kyoto university to study her chosen field bioengineering chemistry she was one of only six women among a thousand in her science and technology program later sachiko’s professor fretted that he wasn’t providing enough help for his lone female student so he contacted a friend in munich germany the result would turn out to be momentous a yearlong research assistantship in a country half a world away where women were not as rare in the lab or in business in munich for the first time kuno received a salary smiles accompany this memory “i learned by doing something like that that i could earn money this was quite a wonderful experience for me because i was not sure before that i could make money by doing what i liked” munich held another lesson one critical to sachiko’s future “i needed to make all of my decisions by myself” she explains “there was no mother no father no professor it was only one year but it was a kind of milestone” she returned to kyoto to finish her phd but japan offered few jobs for quiet female scientists she had no choice but the postdoc path in the lab she met ryuji ueno a brilliant bioscientist with big ideas in the years to come she worked more and more with and for the dashing ueno in what would become another fortuitous combination they fell in love and married ueno focused on prostones a chemical compound with wondrous medicinal potential and as the personal and professional merged at rtech ueno ltd kuno began turning her quiet mind to commercialization all she had to do was learn how to run a company all she needed were business skills legal skills management skills negotiation skills finance skills at first she just listened and watched as many japanese men expected of women anyway but kuno the scientist once too shy to interact outside the lab began to move beyond observation toward a real enterprise to make her own discoveries in a world beyond test tubes “my process was quite one by one” she recalls “we started a small startup … little by little through this process i learned a lot in many decisionmaking points those experiments helped me” halcyon house’s renovated and restored interior is used for everything from receptions to meetings the main salon was part of the expansion carried out by mark twain’s nephew when he owned the historic georgetown mansion the very idea that kuno would meld two of japan’s malecontrolled worlds in science and business was clearly brave but she never saw her newfound interest in entrepreneurship as moving away from science “instead i was getting more into the translation process of basic science into the development of science” to her and ueno the goal was to make medicine and get it to patients by the mids the small company was ready to pursue large dreams if kuno and ueno could only find the money they focused on a glaucoma drug called rescula which required years of work and many millions in development funding clinical trials marketing licensing all that she had not forgotten the salary lesson in germany “i studied the companies in japan i studied and i learned there were no venture capitalists there was no one who would give us money as an investment so we tried to find a corporation which could be a sponsor for our company to be our umbrella” they found one to the tune of  million rescula was on its way but they needed more just as a long recession started in japan “that was a huge debt we owed already even before we had our first products our sponsor didn’t want to repeat that investment that was a scary thing” with the  million still owed but rescula finally reaching patients they kept looking for investors for another sponsor for what kuno knew across the oceans were called venture capitalists maybe they should look in the us they had developed friends and advisers in bethesda maryland but to follow the money would be momentous a corporate move to the states with its risks and opportunities would be much more than a year in bavaria yet the mission to help people with new products beckoned “we saw that the prostone discoveries could be the platform technology to create many different types of medicines … the potential of what i had as a basic technology could be huge i really just wanted to see what we could do” kuno also understood the challenges of remaining “to me as a woman it was much easier to start a company in the united states than staying in japan to struggle to create a company as a female ceo” the year  the entrepreneur shy perhaps now only in memory and the brilliant scientist still focused on the lab were ready in the end this one is simple to recount as simple as wanting to see where fate and finance would take them “we decided to leave everything in japan and the two of us would come to the united states to start a company from scratch” top kuno’s smallish office is classy and workable but still adorned with art from her modern innovative sensibilities if she looked up from her desk she would see over the rooftops of georgetown and across the potomac bottom in her office kuno proudly displays a flag left she was given when she became a us citizen in  just over modernist paintings of two beloved pets looking out from her office right is the stunning view of the potomac the key bridge and the rosslyn skyline  saving sucampo to this day sachiko prefers to meet in small groups at her smallish georgetown office the conference table and its ten chairs reside around a corner just out of eyesight from her simple tabletop desk much closer and in front of the desk are four comfortable and classy fabric club chairs they sit facing each other equally spaced around a small circular coffee table stacked with a few books all properly arranged the chairs align so each occupant clearly sees the eyes of one two but no more than three others — close enough for conversation but far enough to maintain space to equalize height to neutralize any bending back or leaning in king arthur thought of this too kuno’s voice is confident calm and accented from her native land she’s quick to smile ready to reflect open to the most personal of inquiry sometimes english falters for a moment but she nods quickly and easily restarts sentences to arrive at the proper words her face is rounded with flat cheeks and a small mouth bending only slightly downward on the edges she dresses for business – a dark suit tan hose auburn hair midlength turned at the ends and perfectly done manicured hands small but sure never wandering in gesture class is the word with a spot of jewelry in a pin and ring you must look closely at the shoes which seem as dark and allbusiness as the suit to see the bright red surface on the inside edge of the thin threeinch heels class with tiny splash given the power her office represents the room itself is compact with modern glass shelving a few messy piles on the desk a working desk in front of the four club chairs beyond glass doors is a small brick patio featuring a stunning view of the broad potomac marred only by the hum and honks of dc traffic you might suspect that patio is quietest at four in the morning but the crossriver lights of highrise rosslyn must be grand any time after dark this gaspinducing view over the rooftops of georgetown is only the latest result of that move years ago to the united states with advisers and friends and interim financing kuno and ueno established sucampo pharmaceuticals she completed her executive mba at georgetown attending on weekends or evenings like so many other working professionals in the region to learn more she kept listening carefully in those intimate groups around tables small and not so small “they could assist me with this information or that sum of their knowledge or skill but the final thing you need to realize as ceo is – it’s your decision … the final decision always has to come from you” those decisions must have worked as sucampo was out of the  million japanese debt by the first year of the new century she claims not to remember failures but she acknowledges mistakes – perhaps some when she set unreachable goals one of those was to keep sucampo independent of the enormous pharmaceutical conglomerates it would be easy to sell off but that didn’t match the freedom kuno sought she and ueno didn’t leave their home nation and its malecentric mentalities to fall under the control of a huge corporation whose conference tables were large and not round maybe a dreaming mother would not approve that approach either by  sucampo was nearing final clinical trials for its second product amitiza which would be used to treat chronic constipation resulting from various maladies money once more was the key to success even if it wasn’t easy to come by cash was tight in the multimillion context of startup pharmaceuticals for instance kuno knew a  million bond payment was soon due she also knew sucampo had only about  million in the bank that was the entrepreneurial equivalent of a family facing a  mortgage payment when it has only two grand in checking kuno’s plan was twofold and labeled with initials dear to the heart of startups ipo and vc the options of venture support and a stock sale had drawn them to the states in the first place and with the background of rescula and the promise of more prostonebased meds sucampo was a certainty right but the dotcom bubble had burst the internetdigital startup boom lost its venture capital foundation and other bankers disappeared with it the  million deadline loomed in entrepreneurial terms the few months she had left to raise the money were like that mortgage payment coming due this weekend or maybe tomorrow we financial mortals would sell a car borrow from retirement maybe call mom for sucampo kuno always knew there was a third option beyond vc and ipo the conglomerates “i didn’t want to sell in the traditional way to sell to big pharma but i needed to change our strategy i started visiting the big companies to start licensing negotiations” all the evening classes listening to advisers learning with lawyers bankers regulators and entrepreneurs led to this decision “i’m always quite serious in thinking how to reach a goal how to achieve a mission as quickly as possible” just before the bond was due kuno reached a licensing agreement with one company the money arrived in  and  with the ipo finally in  amitiza was approved to treat chronic constipation in various forms first in the us and eventually in switzerland the united kingdom and yes japan kuno and ueno kept the company and the income yes the lab certainly could make money and happiness she and ueno expanded their compound of homes in potomac maryland they joined boards and foundations developing one of their own labeled with certain initials — the sr foundation in part to house this expanding philanthropy in science music and the arts they would soon buy two of dc’s most famous and expensive georgetown mansions halcyon house in  for  million and the landmark evermay for a reported  million by  the name kuno joined forbes magazine’s america’s richest selfmade women and forbes japan named her among the world’s  most powerful women she was worth the magazine reported  million even the beautiful huge kitchen is open to staff halcyon incubator fellows and working visitors to historic halcyon house  starting halcyon sometimes the best way to explore a life is for a sagacious mind to turn inward to describe the uncharted provinces of a world beyond pharmaceuticals finance and foundations to offer what wordsworth intimated were thoughts too deep for tears to explain why sachiko kuno is not a mother some decisions are made for you not by you “i wish i could have had children” she says “it was quite hard for me to accept that part until i was maybe  years old” if her english slows it’s only for a second “how can i say… even before i was born there was my story there were many chapters and i enjoyed many chapters but quite unfortunately i didn’t have a chapter in which i had a child however there were many other things i can do and i did … that’s my story i don’t regret i don’t cry i just accept that” and so we turn to the birth of halcyon the fitting name of the georgetown mansion and now the moniker of a multiidea foundation that aims no less to alter the earth the goal is to find the entrepreneur the scientist the thinker the artist who might create a product or develop an idea that would eventually improve or save thousands of lives in short halcyon should produce well … more sachiko kunos to understand the foundation’s name we require more narrative – this from say a thousand eons ago via ovid and virgil and other tellers of classical legend the beauteous alcyone plotted suicide after her beloved ceyx drowned his ship struck down by zeus to stop this tragedy the gods transformed them both into birds which upon generations were granted a few days without winter storms each year to lay their eggs these are halcyon days this the name that inspired opera poetry film literature and a certain builder of a grand manse in  its gardens designed by mr l’enfant the house was a center of washington society for decades mark twain’s nephew acquired it in  extensively expanding and remodeling among its many histories since include a dorm for georgetown students an ambassador’s home and finally the base for sculptor john dreyfuss who made his art there and rented it out for weddings and other events in  the price tag was  million kuno and ueno finally got it for less six years ago twentythree decades after it was built a renewed and artfilled halcyon house lords over georgetown’s rooftops with no less than the key bridge as its virtual driveway the house today – actually a complex of rooms and halls and workspaces over and under the older historic section with an adjoining residential hall – exhibits the same modernist class of kuno’s wardrobe the tone and curtains and furniture are muted and classic all the better to display the standout contemporary art – paintings sculpture and other works of modern pop and postmodern realms in kuno’s style and mission this is truly now the striking home of halcyon underscoring kuno’s mindset the individual earthchangers halcyon supports must present measurable goals halcyon incubator for early stage social entrepreneurs halcyon arts lab for emerging artists who focus on social impact halcyon stage a boundaryleaping performance series that will stretch throughout dc and beyond halcyon dialogue a series of highest level discussions among global leaders scientists and other big thinkers to discuss the future of said planet and halcyon awards to recognize those dedicated to social change in arts business or policy the restored halcyon house includes a lower workspace for the halcyon incubator fellows who each have a cubicle designed to promote interaction and a sense of kinship in entrepreneurial creativity nearby are closed booths for phone calls the incubator and arts lab are residential with small groups of fellows living and working in or next to halycon house or in the nearby fillmore school to produce art and develop ideas and the ideas at incubator they range from hemorrhagecontrol systems for the battlefield a text messaging platform for atrisk youth a system to maintain rural roads and vaccines that don’t need to be refrigerated most fellows start with a fivemonth residency to jumpstart or boost their ideas carey anne nadeau founder and ceo of the dcbased open data nation data access service credits her  halcyon fellowship with providing links to mentoring and markets not usually open to social enterprises “dr kuno” says nadeau “is an inspiration to our womanowned small business — a strong female entrepreneur who shows that it is possible to both do well and do good” here are two important meanwhiles kuno long a permanent us resident became a citizen just last year – the same year she and ueno ended their marriage spurring a solomonic division of the sr foundation of everymay and halcyon and even of their two retrievers ueno kept mario kuno has cherry by  sr was only a shell with halcyon all in for kuno’s vision according to ceo kate goodall as a mentor kuno taught her “how to shift my perspective from looking at something as an obstacle” goodall says “to looking at the same thing as an opportunity – such a gift” now kuno has built halcyon into what was unavailable to that young woman in japan so many decades ago a haven of time and space for creativity “our values” goodall says “are really an embodiment of dr kuno – risk tolerance optimism nimbleness humility and nurture” and the shy scientist turned philanthropy entrepreneur herself the one who started it all today at age  kuno smiles about her achievements but stays driven to develop to build more story in her rare spare time she secretly paints what do you do with the paintings “i hide” she enjoys paging through design magazines sometimes cooking those japanese meals with soft jazz in the background she prefers the mags over books – too busy she has visited japan much more since leaving the sucampo board in  she has some to say about her former home and its future “japanese leaders are still maybe i think  percent male we cannot see female leaders among bigger corporations and there’s not yet great momentum in japan to think about corporate advancement to support startups” in the end a gap remains between individual potential in japan and the reality of its traditionbound culture kuno says america is home now and halcyon her future kuno comes to work most every day dressed for business to set and achieve measurable goals you get the impression that more enterprises will soon bear the foundation’s name more venturesome ideas will help other women on the path to entrepreneurship she might even nurture another business if the right idea attracts the kuno touch there are after all that vaccine company in gaithersburg the endowed chair in medical innovation at johns hopkins and the allfemale we capital venture investment group she founded now  women and  million strong “when i came to the united states i didn’t think that i could do much now i’m here in an optimistic way in a positive way to encourage younger people to challenge” pause she remembers the shyness the intention to avoid interaction “many people who have the tendency to be alone are searching for something by themselves after that they can talk to people” and tomorrow if the season’s storms are quiet sachiko kuno might let the adored cherry lead her on another path to ponder halcyonic decisions yet to be made ⦾ david everett a writer and
