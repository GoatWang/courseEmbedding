work by john kiernan personal finance editor the manner in which banks operate might seem like a rather basic topic but given how complex financial markets have become in recent years it’s helpful to revisit the fundamental simplicity of the industry having money exactly when you need to it—and earning income on it when you don’t—is a problem as old as money itself banks exist to solve that problem and have served as an intermediary between savers and borrowers since the italian renaissance the crusades or even earlier depending on which historians you consult more specifically banks lend the funds deposited into savings accounts and certificates of deposit cds to other customers who repay the money with interest over time depositors entrust their money to banks for two reasons  banks offer safekeeping borne from fdic insurance and  banks pay interest on deposits allowing funds to grow over time banks in turn make money by charging a higher rate of interest on their loans than what they pay on deposits banks can have other sources of revenue as well including investments fees on various services and commissions on the sale of financial products such as mutual funds and insurance in addition to serving as a vector for borrowing and lending banks play a central role in a number of other financial mechanisms for example banks process payments between buyers and sellers and they exchange foreign currencies banks also carry out governmental monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the amount of money they keep in reserve how do i choose a bank by odysseas papadimitriou wallethub ceo when it comes to selecting a bank the options can be overwhelming in past generations it was common to choose whichever institution was to your home or office or to be lured in by special prizes such as a free toaster these days you might just as easily do business with a bank that’s located across the country or with an onlineonly bank that has no branch offices at all special offers also are less likely to be small kitchen appliances and more likely to be perks such as free checking introductory interest rates or a lump of cash to jumpstart your savings account but before you jump on the bank with the biggest name or the flashiest offers take some time to identify how you’re most likely to use your account and which features are most important to you do you need a brickandmortar location you may find yourself in need of a safedeposit box or if questions arise you may be the kind of person who is most comfortable with facetoface communication if you need access to a real building staffed by live people prioritize your bank’s location and hours bankers’ hours are notoriously short and if your workday overlaps them completely you might want to choose a bank that’s close to your office rather than your home so that you can slip in at lunchtime or you might want to look for a bank with better hours are you a technophile you may find access to better interest rates and fee structures by opting for an onlineonly bank or bank account by the same token you may be able to minimize fees by opting for paperless statements keeping tabs on your account balance electronically and using mobile apps to locate atms that are within your network these are great opportunities and you should take advantage of banks that offer them…if you are likely to use them if your inbox is full of unread email notifications and your phone is loaded with unused apps it helps to be realistic read through the fine print understand the fees and penalties and decide whether they work for your lifestyle do you travel abroad extensively international financial transactions have never been easier or less laborintensive and while most banks charge special fees for international debit card transactions and atm withdrawals others have been able to pass the savings along to their customers if you’re a frequent international traveler it definitely pays to open one of the various no foreign transaction fee credit cards that are on the market  not only will this enable you to avoid the industrystandard  international surcharge but you’ll also save a lot of money on currency conversion since visa and mastercard offer much better rates than bank branches or airport kiosks  you should also look into getting a checking account that charges for neither international debit card use nor foreign atm withdrawals is a sense of responsibility to the community important to you when it comes to banking since the global financial crisis of  the reputation of many banks has suffered a black eye but the banking industry is not a monolithic entity many consumers who are concerned about issues like local development fair lending and executive salaries have turned to small community and cooperative banks as well as credit unions for their banking needs these institutions may be less likely to offer all the bells and whistles of their larger cousins but their mission is to provide the immediate community with the best products and services possible  they’re worth a look at the very least what does it mean to be fdic insured by john kiernan personal finance editor if your bank is fdic insured any money you put into a deposit account along with any earned interest will be returned to you even if your bank fails there are limits of course insurance coverage tops out at  per depositor per institution—not per account as some people assume that means if you have  in a money market account and another  in a cd at the same bank you’ll want to open a new account at a different bank before depositing any more money in order to make everything is insured it’s important to note that fdic insurance covers deposit accounts only that is checking savings cds and money market accounts other investment vehicles that banks sometimes provide such as annuities life insurance and mutual funds including money market funds are not insured most banks and thrifts also known as savings and loan institutions are fdic insured but a few are not by law those that are must display the fdic logo prominently on the bank premises and in written materials if you don’t see the logo or if you have any doubts ask about coverage credit unions are not covered by the fdic but they do have an insurance program of their own sponsored by the national credit union administration ncua  as is the case with banks this provides coverage for up to  per depositor per institution the fdic which stands for the federal deposit insurance corporation was founded by the us government in  in response to the widespread bank failures of the great depression fdic insurance is deemed necessary because bank failures can initiate a devastating domino effect involving consumers commerce other banks and the overall economy and one of the hard lessons of the s and s was that even healthy banks can fail when skittish customers withdraw all their deposits en masse deposit insurance gives depositors the assurance necessary to keep their money in the bank even in the face of frightening economic and financial news in that way it protects not only the consumer but also the banks and the economy community discussion help others find the best banking institutions by sharing what your deciding factor was when choosing your banking institution submit may   petera can

everyday checkinghere is how it works you open an account that consists of a savings acc with some minimal starting amount in my case opening was  and a checking accwith lets say  for total of this type of acc everyday checking comes with a  monthly service fee which one of the ways that could be waved is to maintain a minimum of now as part of this checkingsavings acc is a scam called save as you go that means that every time you make some electronic transaction like paying a bill usually    or more dollars depending on the amount of the transaction will be transferred from your checking part of the acc to the saving accthe idea is that you are to stupid to manage and save your own money so wells fargo will do it for you by moving a dollar or two of your own money from your checking to your savingsas a result of this scam you can find yourself in a position where you have lets say  in your savings acc and  in your checking for a total of so lets assume you make a bill pay to your cable co of  that leaves a balance in your checking acc of  and your so called save as you gosavings acc still has the  for a total of here is the kicker remember you checking had  you paid the cable co  you have left  but because well fargo moved  dollar to your savings your savings amount became  and your checking at  in your checking you are below the  and therefore you are subject to a  monthly service fee even though you still have  in your savingsnow i am sure that those very young smart highly educated people in the wells fargo boardroom get a lot of money paid to find ways that will boost the banks profits but ultimately a pig with a lipstick is still a pigit should be obvious by now that my issue is not the i could close my acc and make sure that these will be the first the last and the only  wells fargo will ever take from me very inexpensive insurance policy against wells fargo ever taking another penny out of me i still think is a scam is designed to exploit the poor

back to work can i get a loan with my credit being horrible is there away to get back on track fast reply  · delete december   swedmusk yes you can get a loan with tarnished credit but you will have to pay a considerably higher interest rate because lenders assume you are a higher risk you should attempt to rebuild the relationships you have with existing creditors to help improve your credit in the short term if your accounts have not gone past  days in delinquency there is a good chance that by calling and speaking to a customer service rep or by sending along a goodwill letter and simultaneously making your accounts current your lenders may report your accounts as never late there are a lot of other ways to remove past negative remarks from your credit report but it is important that your first become current with all over due accounts you should begin by puling your free annual credit report from httpswwwannualcreditreportcom so you can begin to triage the worst of your accounts once you have a better picture of where you credit is now you can begin the process of forming a recovery strategy and determine which lenders may be willing to extend credit to you i would recommend staying away from credit counseling agencies and others such as lexington law because they are incredibly expensive and you can everything and more than they are able to do with a little research of your own you may wish to familiarize yourself with credit good will letters and have a look at the following websiteswwwcreditboardscomwwwmyficocomgood luck you will certainly be
