conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period some of the more significant estimates required to be made by management include recognition of income for work completed and unbilled to customers the allowance for doubtful accounts and the valuation of the license agreement  actual results could differ from those estimates   the company believes that funds generated from operations together with existing cash and cash infusions by major stockholders will be sufficient to finance its operations for the next twelve months but are likely to be insufficient to fund its contractual obligations and to fund growth  the company expects to seek additional capital to cover any working capital needs and its contractual obligations and to fund growth initiatives in its identified markets  however there can be no assurance that any new debt or equity financing arrangement will be available to the company

the project or an agreed upon fee structure income for services rendered is recognized on a time and materials basis or on a fixedfee or cappedfee basis in accordance with accounting and disclosure

shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted income loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the

that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable management’s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events considered in the aggregate indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the
