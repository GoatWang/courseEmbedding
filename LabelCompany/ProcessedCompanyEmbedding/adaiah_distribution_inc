  item  business   general   adaiah distribution inc was incorporated in the state of nevada as a forprofit company on september   and established a fiscal year end of october  we have generated revenues of  through october   have  in assets  in liabilities and have incurred losses of  since inception we are a developmentstage company formed to develop and distribute our product to the pillow industry it is our goal to do business in the us russia and the european union to date we have had some business operations we have developed our business plan and executed contracts with ningbo hounuo plastic co ltd hangzhou yintex co ltd suemon furniture co ltd vision industry co ltd and eo international trade co ltd where we engage these companies as independent contractors for the specific purpose of developing manufacturing and supplying products to us adaiah distribution inc then distributes these neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows to our customers          we received the initial equity funding of  from our sole officer and director who purchased  shares of our common stock at  per share in january  the company issued  shares of common stock to  independent persons pursuant to the registration statement on form s for total cash proceeds of    on november   the companys board of directors elected by unanimous written consent to file articles of amendment to its articles of incorporation with the nevada secretary of state to i increase the companys authorized number of shares of common stock from  million to  million and ii increase the companys total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a forward split of such shares at the rate of  shares for every one  share currently issued and outstanding the forward split on december   the company filed such articles of amendment with the nevada secretary of state the record date for the forward split is december     on december   the company filed an issuer companyrelated action notification form with finra requesting that the aforementioned forward split be effected in the market such notification form is being reviewed by finra   on december   the company by written consent of the board of directors approved the issuance to mr nikolay titov of  restricted shares of the companys common stock in exchange for continued services as the sole member of the board and the companys sole executive officer these shares are being issued subsequent to the stock split and increased the companys total issued and outstanding shares following such stock split to  million shares   because we were not able to raise sufficient capital to execute our full business plan we are now engaged in discussions with third parties regarding alternative directions for the company that could enhance shareholder value as of the date of filing this report on form k we have not entered into any definitive agreement to change our direction the description of our business below assumes that we will continue with our business as originally planned however as noted above we are in discussions that could lead to another direction for the company   we currently have revenues from operations but there is no guarantee this will continue or there will be enough gross profit to sustain operations if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely we may need more funds for business operations in the next year and we may have to revert to obtaining additional money   we had generated  in revenue through october   our cost of sales was  which included  in pillow purchases and  in sales commissions our independent salespeople are paid a commission of  of the initial sale to the customer commissions are not paid on any reorders from the same customer in this way we encourage new sales instead of the salesperson making one sale and getting paid from it during the lifetime of the customer account the revenue was the result of pillow sales right now we are focusing on distributing ready made products from our suppliers however we have produced and sold a number of custom pillows from our sewing shop          the company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act the “jobs act” we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved as well our election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they apply to private companies therefore as a result of our election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   our current business   our product   history of the pillow   the pillow has a strong historical presence wherever people have been civilized enough to desire more comfort than that of the floor or a piece of furniture the first people to use pillows were those who lived in early civilizations of mesopotamia around  bc during this time only the wealthy and more fortunate people of the world were the ones who used pillows the number of pillows symbolized status so the more pillows one owned the more affluence he or she held pillows have always been produced around the world in order to help solve the old reoccurring problem of neck back and shoulder pain while sleeping the pillow was also used in order to keep bugs and insects out of peoples hair mouth nose and ears while sleeping   pillow use has been associated with the mummies and tombs of ancient egypt dating back to  bc ancient egyptian pillows were wooden or stone headrests these pillows were mostly used by placing them under the heads of the deceased because the head of a human was considered to be the essence of life and sacred the romans and greeks of ancient europe mastered the creation of the softer pillow these pillows were stuffed with reeds feathers and straw in order to make them softer and more comfortable only upperclass people typically owned these softer pillows however all classes of people used some type of pillow while sleeping in order to give them support people in ancient europe started to use pillows when going to church in order to kneel on while praying and to place holy books on this is a tradition that still lives on today additionally the romans and greeks used their pillows by placing them under the head of those deceased just like the ancient egyptians did european pillows continue to have a lot of popularity still to this day because of their beauty and quality   chinese dynasties used pillows that were made from a wide range of materials including bamboo jade porcelain wood and bronze porcelain pillows became the most popular the use of the porcelain pillow first appeared in the sui dynasty between  and  while mass production of the porcelain pillow appeared in the tang dynasty between  and  the chinese decorated their pillows by making them different shapes and by painting pictures of animals humans and plants on them ancient chinese porcelain pillows reached their peak in terms of production and use during the song jin and yuan dynasties between the th and th century but slowly phased out during the ming and qing dynasties between  and  with the emergence of better pillow making materials          how a pillow is constructed   internally a pillow comprises a filler often made from foam synthetic plastic fibers feathers or down and viscoelastic foam and latex traditionally straw was used as filler but this is uncomfortable and rarely used today feathers and down are the most expensive and usually the most comfortable they offer the advantage of softness and their ability to conform to shapes desired by the user more so than foam or fiber pillows one of the disadvantages of a downfilled pillow is that a significant number of people are allergic to them there are currently hypoallergenic varieties of down pillows to allow people sensitive to down to enjoy the comfort of feather or down pillows in asia buckwheat is a common filler as are plastic imitations such pillows tend to be smaller than a standard pillow in india cotton is also a common filler and is considered to be healthier than synthetic fills   the fill is surrounded with a cover or shell made of cloth such as silk known as the pillow case or pillow slip some pillows have a fancier cover called a sham which is closed on all sides and usually has a slit in the back through which the pillow is placed rectangular standard bed pillow cases usually do not have zippers but instead have one side open all the time however a zippered pillow protector is often placed around standard pillows with the case in turn covering the protector it is generally recommended that all types of pillow covers be laundered periodically since they are the part that is in contact with a persons body but even with regular washing pillows tend to accumulate dust and microbes among the fill and it is recommended that they be replaced every few years especially for those with allergies   types of pillows   neck pillows support the neck by providing a deep area for the head to rest and a supportive area to keep the neck in alignment with the spine while sleeping these can also be known as cervical pillows   travel pillows provide support for the neck in a sitting position their u shape fits around the back of the neck and keeps the head from slipping into an uncomfortable and possibly harmful position during sleep however ushaped pillows can sometimes force the head forwards creating neck stiffness   donut pillows are firm pillows shaped like a torus with a space in the middle to alleviate pressure on the tailbone area while sitting these pillows are used primarily by individuals who have suffered an injury to the tailbone area or who suffer pain from hemorrhoids or another ailment of the colon   lumbar pillows are designed to support the inward curve of the lower back filling the space created between the lower back and the back of the chair when in a sitting position these pillows are generally used to support the lower back while driving or sitting such as in an office chair orthopedic pillows are similar to memory foam pillows   decorative pillows serve a dual purpose they likely have fancy cover material which serves to decorate the room where they are found when used to decorate a fully made up bed decorative pillows are likely thrown aside at bedtime since they are not covered with a washable pillow case thus while found on the bed they are primarily there for decoration hence they fall under this category these pillows may be custom made as well as made by freelancers   decorative pillows are also found on furnishings in more public parts of the home such as sofas chairs and window seats here their common use may overlap both orthopedic and bed pillows for example unless a person has some particular medical condition they will likely use a handy decorative pillow for lumbar support as needed while seated on a sofa likewise for the occasional nap decorative pillows are handy for supporting the head or neck even though they are not covered with a pillow case as are bed pillows          the state of the consumer and distributor market for pillows   management believes the state of the consumer and distributor market for pillows continues to expand and grow this belief is primarily based upon internet market research and discussions with manufacturers suppliers and distributors based upon this research management believes the following are the key points in determining the state of the industry      decorative pillows are generally considered a cheap way to spruce up your home while sleep pillows are increasingly marketed as a way to enhance health          china and india currently dominate the pillow production market and are likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future their market position is based largely on lowcost high volume westerndesigned goods          many buyers and consumers seek unique specialty products while there continues to be a market for standard pillow design there is a growing market for smaller production unique designs products that combine unique elements with modern designs are a growing category and represent an opportunity for our company          lowend with a priority on low prices and highend with priority on high quality markets continue to expand competition at the low end is strong and requires very large production capacity the highend market tends to focus on unique designs high quality and small quantities with flexibility design and pricing          there is a growing market for home accessory products particularly in the highend segment it is expected to grow not only in western markets but in all regions as middleclass populations expand          purchasers of all types of pillows prefer multiple product options to choose from flexibility to make design modifications and reliable suppliers there are many producers and suppliers of pillow products in order to stay competitive we will have to stand out among them we plan to do this by focusing on customer service and reliable delivery   target market   we have already identified major distributors of neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows in the usa and intend to market directly to these distributors upon completion of our public offering the initial list of distributors we obtained using internet  future distributors we are planning to obtain via expo and trade shows it is our goal to do business in the us russia and the european union we are planning to focus our business plan on those markets for next year to establish relationship with major distribution companies after that if we are successful in the us market we may expand to canada and mexico using the same strategy   our main clients are distributors but in some areas there are no distributors so we will sell directly to the public most of the revenue will be received from distributors as they are our main target market we do not currently have any agreements or contracts with distributors some sales to date have been made by our independent sales representatives and others by the company’s president in the future as we grow and have the ability to fulfill large orders and negotiate pricing we may enter into agreements or contracts with distributors if it is in the best interests of the company          marketing   in places where are no distributors we are planning to market our products using these resources    internet advertising google adsence  magazine advertising design trade magazine  expo

estimated delivery times to all major markets based on the fact that our pillows will be produced in china we anticipate  days delivery time to the us   contracts   we have executed the contracts with

securities and exchange commission   revenue    our revenue is a  mark up depending on quantity of the order if it is a large order we may give a lower markup if it is a small order or custom order the markup may be greater this is general estimation of our mark up we looked at our competitors sales prices at the cost of product from our suppliers and came up with an approximate markup figure we can adjust it if need be so in any case it is going to be just an estimate until we have more sales    manufacturer gives us  days to pay an invoice and we give to our customers  days depending on a quantity of the order to pay their invoices which allows us to make sales without initial investment for neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows    we do not keep warehousing and shipping within the country because all the products will be going directly to our customers from the manufacturer eliminating our storage costs the customer is responsible for any shipping charges   competition   there are few barriers of entry in the neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows distribution business and level of competition is extremely high there are many domestic and international distributors of neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows we are in direct competition with them many large distributors have greater financial capabilities than us and will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers many of these companies have a greater more established customer base than us we likely lose business to such companies also many of these companies are able to afford to offer better prices for similar neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows than us which may also cause us to lose business   insurance   we do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future because we do not have any insurance if we are made a party of a products liability action we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation if that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations          employees   we are a development stage company and currently have no employees other than nikolay titov our president and director we currently have three independent sales representatives to sell are product our independent salespeople are paid a commission of  of the initial sale to the customer commissions are not paid on any reorders from the same customer in this way we encourage new sales instead of the salesperson making one sale and getting paid from it during the lifetime of the customer account   offices   our business office is located at poruka iela  madona lv latvia this is the office provided by our president and director nikolay titov our office is a part of a mr titov’s residence our president and director nikolay titov currently takes care of our administrative duties from this office in latvia our phone number is  we do not pay any rent to mr titov and there is no agreement to pay any rent in the future   on january   we purchased for us a  sq ft building located at  oktyabrskaya st manchazh settlement artinsky district sverdlovsk oblast russia the building was formerly used as a sewing shop and we were able to purchase the contents of the building which includes  sewing machines the building has one office area of  sq ft and the remaining is production floor area management currently has  independent contractors who will work on orders for custom pillows at this location when we receive orders the maximum number of pillows that could be produced per week at this location is estimated at  pieces   government regulation   we are required to comply with all regulations rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows distribution business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities all products imported from china and hong kong are required to meet us standards so we do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business   legal proceedings    we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or potential legal actions   emerging growth company status under the jobs act   adaiah distribution inc qualifies as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act the “jobs act”   the jobs act creates a new category of issuers known as emerging growth companies emerging growth companies are those with annual gross revenues of less than  billion as indexed for inflation during their most recently completed fiscal year the jobs act is intended to facilitate public offerings by emerging growth companies by exempting them from several provisions of the securities act of  and its regulations an emerging growth company will retain that status until the earliest of   · the first fiscal year after its annual revenues exceed  billion · the first fiscal year after the fifth anniversary of its ipo · the date on which the company has issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous threeyear period and · the first fiscal year in which the company has a public float of at least  million           financial and audit requirements   under the jobs act emerging growth companies are subject to scaled financial disclosure requirements pursuant to these scaled requirements emerging growth companies may   · provide only two rather than three years of audited financial statements in their ipo registration statement · provide selected financial data only for periods no earlier than those included in the ipo registration statement in all sec filings rather than the five years of selected financial data normally required · delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until they are made applicable to private companies and · be exempted from compliance with section b of the sarbanesoxley act which requires companies to receive an outside auditors attestation regarding the issuers internal controls   offering requirements   in addition during the ipo offering process emerging growth companies are exempt from   · restrictions on analyst research prior to and immediately after the ipo even from an investment bank that is underwriting the ipo · certain restrictions on communications to institutional investors before filing the ipo registration statement and · the requirement initially to publicly file ipo registration statements emerging growth companies can confidentially file draft registration statements and any amendments with the sec public filings of the draft documents must be made at least  days prior to commencement of the ipo road show   other public company requirements   emerging growth companies are also exempt from other ongoing obligations of most public companies such as   · the requirements under section i of the exchange act and section b of the doddfrank act to disclose executive compensation information on payforperformance and the ratio of ceo to median employee compensation · certain other executive compensation disclosure requirements such as the compensation discussion and analysis under item  of regulation sk and · the requirements under sections aa and b of the exchange act to hold advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments   smaller reporting company   we have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this annual report which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” further we may continue to take advantage of these reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies even if we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company          in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” for complying with new or revised accounting standards we have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   we could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period   item a risk factors   our common shares are considered speculative prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set out below   risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this annual report before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment   risks associated to our business   we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business it is very likely we will incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future   we were incorporated on september   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities and limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new distribution companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates it is very likely that we will incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate sufficient operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail           we have earned only limited revenue and our ability to sustain our operations is dependent on our ability to raise financing   we have accrued a net loss of  for the period from our inception on september   to october   and have  in revenues as of this date our future is dependent future profitable operations in the neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows distribution business further the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth if we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed we may not be able to complete our business plan as a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment you should consider our independent registered public accountant’s comments when determining if an investment in adaiah distribution inc is suitable   if we experience a shortage of funds we may utilize funds loaned to us from nikolay titov our officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees and operation expenses however mr titov has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company we may need additional financing we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing   the effect of the recent economic crisis may impact our business operating results or financial conditions   the recent global crisis has caused disruption and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and has impacted levels of consumer spending these macroeconomic developments may affect our business operating results or financial condition in a number of ways for example customers may stop spending with us may have difficulty paying us or may delay paying us for previously purchased items a slow or uneven pace of economic recovery would negatively affect our ability to expand our distribution business and obtain financing   because we purchase our products from china and hong kong and a limited number of specialty pillows may continue to be produced in our russian manufacuring plant a disruption in the delivery of imported products may have a greater effect on us than on our competitors   we import the majority of our product from china and hong kong with a limited number of specialty pillows produced in our russian plant because we import the majority of our product and deliver it directly to our customers we believe that disruptions in shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on competitors who manufacture andor warehouse products in the united states russia and the european union deliveries of our products may be disrupted through factors such as    raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest  problems with ocean shipping including work stoppages and shipping container shortages  increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments and  economic crises international disputes and wars   most of our competitors warehouse products they import from overseas which allows them to continue delivering their products for the near term despite overseas shipping disruptions if our competitors are able to deliver products when we cannot our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers to our competitors          foreign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition   we currently purchase our products in us dollars and plan to do so in the future however we source all of our products from china and hong kong and as such the cost of our pillow products may be affected by changes in the value of the chinese yuan and the hong kong dollar due to our dependence on manufacturing operations in china and hong kong changes in the value of the chinese yuan or hong kong dollar may have a material impact on our supply channels and manufacturing costs changes in the currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same market if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations   if we do not attract additional customers we will not make a profit which ultimately will result in a cessation of operations   our sales to date have been to only one customer we cannot guarantee we will be able to expand our customer base even if we obtain additional customers there is no guarantee that we will sustain profits if we cannot sustain profits we will have to suspend or cease operations you are likely to lose your entire investment if we cannot sell our neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows at prices which generate a profit   we operate in a highly competitive environment and if we are unable to continue to compete with our competitors our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected   we operate in a highly competitive environment our competition includes large small and midsized companies and many of them may distribute similar neck head donut lumbar decorative throw and orthopedic pillows in our markets at competitive prices this highly competitive environment could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects   because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations   due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must currently limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our product known to potential customers because we must limit our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations   because the company’s headquarter and assets are primarily located outside the united states in latvia and the russian federation investors may experience difficulties in attempting to effect service of process and to enforce judgments based upon us federal securities laws against the company and its nonus resident officer and director   while we are organized under the laws of state of nevada our officer and director is a nonus resident and our headquarters and assets are located outside the united states our headquarters are in latvia and our major asset the sewing shop is located in the russian federation consequently it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process on him in the united states and to enforce in the united states judgments obtained in united states courts against him based on the civil liability provisions of the united states securities laws enforce in a latvian court united states judgments based on the civil liability provisions of the united states securities laws or bring an original action against him in a latvian court to enforce liabilities based upon the united states federal securities laws since all our assets will be located outside us it may be difficult or impossible for us investors to collect a judgment against us          because our officer and director owns  or of our outstanding common stock he may make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders   mr titov our president and director owns  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly he has full control in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of mr titov may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders   in addition sales of significant amounts of shares held by mr titov or the prospect of these sales could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock his stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price   because our current president has other business interests he may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to our business operations causing our business to fail   nikolay titov our president and director currently devotes approximately twenty hours per week providing management services to us while he presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interest it is possible that the demands on him from other obligations could increase with the result that he would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business the loss of mr titov’s services to our company could negatively impact our business development mr titov does not owe fiduciary duties to any companies or entities other than adaiah distribution   if nikolay titov our president and director should resign we will not have a chief executive officer and that could result in our having to suspend operations if that should occur you could lose your investment   we depend completely on the services of our president and director nikolay titov for the future success of our business the loss of the services of mr titov could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if he should resign we will not have a chief executive officer if that should occur until we find another person to act as our chief executive officer our operations could be suspended in that event it is possible you could lose your entire investment   we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all   we are required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  month will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not continue to qualify for quotation on the otc bulletin board          our officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting   nikolay titov our director has no past experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of the end of the period covered by this report the company carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and de under the securities exchange act of  in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the company in its reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods in carrying out that evaluation management identified a material weakness as defined in public company accounting oversight board standard no  in our internal control over financial reporting regarding a lack of adequate segregation of duties accordingly based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of october   the company’s chief executive officer and its chief financial officer have concluded that as of that date the company’s controls and procedures were not effective for the purposes described above   there was no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af and df under the securities exchange act of  during the year ended october   that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the securities exchange act of  we have assessed the effectiveness of those internal controls as of september   using the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” internal control – intergrated framework as a basis for our assessment          because of inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation   a material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the company’s ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected in the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting this material weakness consisted of inadequate staffing and supervision within the bookkeeping and accounting operations of our company the relatively small number of employees who have bookkeeping and accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system the inadequate segregation of duties is a weakness because it could lead to the untimely identification and resolution of accounting and disclosure matters or could lead to a failure to perform timely and effective reviews   as we are not aware of any instance in which the company failed to identify or resolve a disclosure matter or failed to perform a timely and effective review we determined that the addition of personnel to our bookkeeping and accounting operations is not an efficient use of our resources at this time and not in the interest of shareholders   because of the above condition the company’s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of october     this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to
