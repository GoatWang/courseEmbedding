wishlist endorsements  see all product description john calvins institutes of the christian religion is a defining book of the reformation and a pillar of protestant theology first published in latin in  and in calvins native french in  the institutes argues for the majesty of god and for justification by faith alone the book decisively shaped calvinism as a major religious and intellectual force in europe and throughout the world here bruce gordon provides an essential biography of calvins influential and enduring theological masterpiece tracing the diverse ways it has been read and interpreted from calvins time to todaygordon explores the origins and character of the institutes looking closely at its theological and historical roots and explaining how it evolved through numerous editions to become a complete summary of reformation doctrine he shows how the development of the book reflected the evolving thought of calvin who instilled in the work a restlessness that reflected his understanding of the christian life as a journey to god following calvins death in  the institutes continued to be reprinted reedited and reworked through the centuries gordon describes how it has been used in radically different ways such as in south africa where it was invoked both to defend and attack the horror of apartheid he examines its vexed relationship with the historical calvina figure both revered and despisedand charts its robust and contentious reception history taking readers from the puritans and voltaire to youtube the novels of marilynne robinson and to china and africa where the institutes continues to find new audiences today read more related resources john calvin and his passion for the majesty of god john piper 9 john calvin godfrey w robert  the soul of

graduation ceremony on sat april 9 where he received a lifetime achievement alumni award saying that the award meant “more to me than you’ll ever know” bruce delivered  a lively speech in which he recounted another college’s admissions counselor telling his dad that his son “didn’t have the right stuff” to design sharpening pencils as a parttime office boy at the studio of architect and designer eliot noyes meeting the “gods of design” through the college’s lecture series including charles eames paolo soleri and niels diffrient the latter with whom he became best friends bruce completely won the audience over when he brought out some props for “show and tell” from behind the podium he pulled out the first drawing he ever created at art center which he made for a class taught by legendary instructor ted youngkin he told the students that he had turned down a tantalizing late night invitation from a beautiful woman in order to complete that drawing for youngkin’s class ”the next morning i said ‘mr youngkin do you realize what i sacrificed for you’” bruce said with a laugh “but he had this capability of making you want to do something for him” industrial design alumnus gordon bruce bs  holds up the very first drawing he made for art center photo john dlugolecki later bruce brought out a bunch of bananas and told a story about teaching at samsung’s innovation design lab and asking his students to spend ₩ on a product bring it to class and tell him why it’s a beautiful object bruce said they brought back “the worst stuff terrible all kitschy” and then showed the class what be bought for the same amount of money a bunch of bananas bruce continued they said ‘bananas what do bananas have to do with design’ mother nature is the best designer it comes in a bunch you can buy as many as you want it’s customizable it’s convenient places a banana in his pocket it fits in your pocket it’s intuitive i know you don’t eat a banana this way pretending to eat the banana like corn on the cob sanitation pointing to the peel it protects the inside biodegradable potassium taking a bite delicious chewing the banana easily manufactured it’s the biggest market in the world everybody loves bananas so i told my my fellow designers ‘imagine if you could design a product that uses these same principles’ … so they said ‘you mean we should design a cell phone that looks like a banana’ sighs so i realized i had a long way to go after which bruce received a loud round of applause more on gordon bruce throughout his career torontoborn author and
