funds association bvi bundesverband investment und asset management mrs le poidevin said the bvis assistance and support for the application demonstrated the demand within the german fund community to have a wider set of potential investment opportunities including securities listed on tise at the same time this recognition also means that issuers seeking to list securities on tise now have an even wider set of investors who can invest into their products she added the german mutual fund market offers a significant pool of potential capital which could be deployed and so this recognition adds
