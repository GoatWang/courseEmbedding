complex family tree he had postal stations built each a days travel from the next across all of western europe it was at this time that the deutsche post trademark literally made its appearance postilion riders announced their arrival and the pending change of horses by sounding their mail horn the visionary family of thurn and taxis secured for themselves at that time not only the right to transport mail but also in  the exclusive use of the mail horn as a trademark in the nineteenth century the number of couriers on horseback dropped coaches supplanted them in the beginning followed later by trains the sign of the mail horn was still used however on flags stamps mail boxes and postage stamps for thurn and taxis the symbol originally served to identify couriers as legitimate postilions now it stood for the german national postal organization starting in  this organization became the deutsche bundespost the german federal postal service in addition to delivering letters and parcels as well as banking services the postal horn at that time also stood for a company that provided citizens with telephone services in the mids deutsche bundespost was split into three companies postbank deutsche telekom and deutsche post deutsche post was subsequently privatized and went public in  with the acquisition and integration of international express and logistics brands like dhl danzas and exel the company became the world leader in the mail express and logistics industry of the third millennium the group has gone by the name of deutsche post dhl since  and presents
