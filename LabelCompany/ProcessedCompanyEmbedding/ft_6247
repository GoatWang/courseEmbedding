maintained in top condition for safety on the road we have the auto parts you need to keep your ride running well this extensive inventory includes items that are easily replaceable like wiper blades and headlights along with parts that require more auto repair knowledge such as brakes spark plugs and suspension systems no matter your level of automaintenance prowess its easy to find the part for your project when you know exactly what you need filters and hoses although there are many places where you can take your car to get you oil changed and fluid levels topped off theres something satisfying about changing your own oil and replacing belts and hoses that are getting too old unlike other projects that take place under the vehicle hood or chassis changing the oil is something even novices can do if they have the space the right tools and the replacement oil and filter check your owners manual to determine which oil filter is appropriate for your vehicle before undertaking this task walmart carries a complete line of replacement filters and different types of oil depending on your climate and style of driving if you have belts that squeak or hoses that have cracks its easy to replace them with the manufacturerrecommended replacements parts check the other filters you have on your vehicle such as an air filter or fuel filter and replace them at the recommended time batteries and spark plugs batteries for the most part are also an easy replacement when your vehicle needs a new one however some batteries are placed in different positions depending on the vehicle and may require you to move other components and parts out of the way before youre able to access the battery when selecting a battery determine the size of the battery you need the desired cold crank amps and the necessary voltage you can also purchase based on group size  and f are common options spark plugs are the parts that provide the electric current to fire your vehicles engine these days they last much longer than they did even  or  years ago but still require replacing from time to time this is done using a socket wrench with a long handle lights being able to see especially in the dark or inclement weather situations is crucial when operating a vehicle this goes for the exterior lighting as well as interior illumination if you need to replace the headlights or taillights on your vehicle its easy to simply change a bulb or completely replace the style of the headlights for a new look or brighter appearance with halogen and xenon replacement bulbs for headlights these are available for both regular headlights and highbeam headlights fog lights and taillight replacement bulbs are available and interior lighting options include bulbs that work with mirrored lighting and overhead lamps suspension systems for those doityourselfers with a little more autorepair knowledge more difficult tasks like replacing the suspension parts on your car truck suv or other vehicle is possible the parts youll need include shock absorbers and struts in some cases its only necessary to replace an individual part such as a shock absorber however sometimes the replacement is much more involved such as when an entire strut assembly must be replaced all our suspension replacement parts are from top brands and highly recommended by vehicle manufacturers as replacement parts many of these types of parts also come with a limited warranty brakes similar to the suspension system another crucial part of your vehicle is its braking system there are many parts that make up the brake system in addition to the brakes which are typically either disc or drum style you may also need rotors or replacements for the brake lines reservoir and hoses in addition to the individual parts you can also find brake kits that include all parts needed for a brake change other replacement parts as a vehicle ages it becomes necessary to replace many of the parts that incur daily wear although major parts like an engine may never have to be replaced many other parts on a vehicle will be changed at least once during a vehicles lifetime when it comes to replacing items related to your autos air conditioning or heating system or motors that operate the wiper blades or any of the various switches sensors and other parts that make up your vehicle walmart carries what you need in addition we
