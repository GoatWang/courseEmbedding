cabinet of his own ford established his policies during his first year in office despite opposition from a heavily democratic congress his first goal was to curb inflation then when recession became the nations most serious domestic problem he shifted to measures aimed at stimulating the economy but still fearing inflation ford vetoed a number of nonmilitary appropriations bills that would have further increased the already heavy budgetary deficit during his first  months as president he vetoed  measures his vetoes were usually sustained ford continued as he had in his congressional days to view himself as a moderate in domestic affairs a conservative in fiscal affairs and a dyedinthewool internationalist in foreign affairs a major goal was to help business operate more freely by reducing taxes upon it and easing the controls exercised by regulatory agencies wedeclared our independence  years ago and we are not about to lose it now to paper shufflers and computers he said in
