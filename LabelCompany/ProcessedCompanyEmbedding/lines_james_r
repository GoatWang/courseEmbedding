imagined the level of sophistication that would be required of equipment used for the transmission and distribution of electric power a little more than a century after its invention nor could he have anticipated all of the complex issues facing the electrical industry as it moves into the twentyfirst century with the only research and development lab in the industry still named after this prodigious inventor the thomas a edison technical center cooper power systems is proud to trace its heritage back to this industry pioneer thomas a edison incorporated one of thomas edison’s original

particular market segment or fulfill a particular mission product lines are of course nothing new in manufacturing airbus builds one and so do ford dell and even mcdonalds each of these companies exploits commonality in different ways boeing for example developed the  and  transports in tandem and the parts lists for these very two different aircraft overlap by about  achieving significant economies of production and maintenance but software product lines based on interproduct commonality are a relatively new concept that is rapidly emerging as a viable and important software development paradigm product flexibility is the anthem of the software marketplace and product lines fulfill the promise of tailormade systems built specifically for the needs of particular customers or customer groups a product line succeeds because the commonalities shared by the software products can be exploited to achieve economies of production the products are built from common assets in a prescribed way organizations are finding that this practice of building sets of related systems from common assets can yield remarkable quantitative improvements in productivity time to market product quality and customer satisfaction they are finding that a software product line can efficiently satisfy the current hunger for mass customization organizations that acquire as opposed to build software systems are finding that commissioning a set of related systems as a commonly developed product line yields economies in delivery time cost simplified training and streamlined acquisition but along with the gains come risks using a product line approach constitutes a new technical strategy for the organization organizational and management issues constitute obstacles that are critical to overcome and often add more risk because they are less obvious building a software product line and bringing it to market require a blend of skillful engineering as well as both technical and organizational management acquiring a software product line also requires this same blend of skills to position the supplier organizations so they can effectively exploit the commonality of the incoming products as well as lend sound technical oversight and monitoring to the development effort these skills are necessary to overcome the pitfalls that may bring failure to an unsophisticated organizationyoull find examples of real software product lines listed in the catalog of software product lines the examples cover diverse domains and show the kind of improvements your organization can achieve using a product line approach software product lines practices and patterns provides a framework of specific practices with detailed case studies to guide the implementation of product lines in your organization the software product lines essentials presentation provides a brief overview of the what why and how of product line conceptsthe framework for software product line practice describes a framework for product line development it is an online product line encyclopedia a webbased document describing the essential activities and practices in both the technical and organizational areas these activities and practices are those in which an organization must be competent before it can reap the maximum benefit from fielding a product line of software or

software product lines are emerging as a viable and important development paradigm allowing companies to realize orderofmagnitude improvements in time to market cost productivity quality and other business drivers software product line engineering can also enable rapid market entry and flexible response and provide a capability for mass customization  we are working to make software product
