this quarter results are stable compared to the previous quarter and the first quarter of  in our fixed income real estate rent and operating income while our net income has decreased somewhat due

for the first quarter of  our recurring ffo decreased to  compared to the first quarter of  the decrease in our recurring ffo is primarily due to an increase in our equity share in losses of

financial measure is operating income which to calculate noi is adjusted to add back real estate depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses and other operation expenses less gain on sale of operating properties we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe that noi when combined with the primary gaap presentations provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense item that are incurred at the property level we consider the noi to be an appropriate supplemental nongaap measure to operating income because it assists management and thereby investors to understand the core property operations prior to depreciation and amortization expenses and general and administrative costs in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate we consider the noi to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets the metric noi should only be considered as supplemental to the metric operating income as a measure of our performance noi should not be used as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions noi

representative of ongoing operating results including transaction costs associated with acquisitions we use ffo internally as a performance measure and we believe ffo when combined with the primary gaap presentations is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance as its a recognized metric used extensively by the real estate industry we also believe that recurring ffo is a useful supplemental measure of our core operating performance the company believes that financial analysts investors and shareholders are better served by the presentation of operating results generated from its ffo and recurring ffo measures we consider the ffo and recurring ffo to be an appropriate supplemental nongaap measure to operating income because it assists management and thereby investors in
