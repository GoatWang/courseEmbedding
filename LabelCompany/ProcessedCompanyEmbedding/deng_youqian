research  homepage of youqian deng homepage of youqian deng home research publication patent honors  research summary i my postdoc research is focused on palladiumcatalyzed oxidative carbocyclization palladiumcatalyzed oxidative arylating carbocyclization of allenynes the pdiicatalyzed oxidative arylative carbocyclization of allenynes has been realized and allows the synthesis of either vinylallenes or cross conjugated trienes selectively under mild conditions two possible mechanisms were suggested to rationalize the formation of the different types of products control experiments indicate that pbenzoquinone bq plays an important role as a ligand in addition to its role as an oxidant for the reaction  control of selectivity in palladiumcatalyzed oxidative borylationg carbocyclization of allenynes a highly selective carbocyclizationborylation of allenynes with bpin under palladium catalysis employing bq as the oxidant was realized where the subtle application of lioac·ho with dichloroethane dce as the solvent and bf·eto together with thf are crucial for the selective formation of borylated trienes and vinylallenes respectively  palladiumcatalyzed oxidative acyloxylationcarbocyclization of allenynes a novel palladiumiicatalyzed oxidative acyloxylationcarbocyclization of allenynes was developed to provide access to synthetically useful acyloxylated vinylallenes where a new cc bond a new co bond and a new allene structure are formed furthermore a biomimetic version of this transformation using catalytic amount of bq was also realized to enhance the utility of this methodii my phd research program is focused on transition metalcatalyzed reactions of functionalized allenes and bisallenes pdclnaicatalyzed homodimeric couplingcyclization of allenolstransition metalcatalyzed cyclizative dimerization reaction of two functionalized allenes is attractive for synthetic organic chemists due to the issues of chirality transfer diversity and substituentloading capability of allenes we have developed a homodimeric couplingcyclization reaction of allenols using pdclnai as the catalyst which provides an efficient route to ’’dien’yldihydrofuran derivatives when optically active allenols was used under the same reaction conditions no racemization was observed it was found that the catalytically active specie was pdi which might be produced in situ from pdcl and nai the reaction may via cyclic oxypalladation regioselective carbopalladation subsequent transbhydroxide elimination afford productand ipdoh finally ipdoh was converted to pdi by its reaction with hi generated in the first step pdicatalyzed cross coupling cyclization involving two different allenolsthe cyclization involving two molecules of same class of allenes yet with different structures has never been realized probably due to the difficulty encountered in the molecular recognition after realization of homodimerization of two same allenols we have developed the first example of dimeric couplingcyclization reaction of two different allenols using the pdi as the catalyst in the presence of bf·eto providing an efficient route to ’’dien’yldihydrofuran derivatives in which the substituted allenols construct the dihydrofuran ring while the nonsubstituted allenols provide the diene unit at the position by applying deliberate control of electronic and steric effects the belimination process is believed to be mediated by the presence of lewis acid   the pdiicatalyzed tandemcyclization of ωbisallenolsafter the realization of intermolecular couplingcyclization of allenols we turned our attention to intramolecular cyclization of ωbisallenols in the presence of pdiicatalyst the reaction of ωbisallenols can form dihydrofuran fused bicyclic skeletons with “unsymmetric” substrates the reaction may be realized by converting one hydroxyl group to acetate optically active bicyclic products may be easily prepared by applying the novozym catalyzed kinetic resolution and the tandem double cyclization of these optically active substrates   selectivity manipulation of bicyclization of bisallenylketones pd versus rh and electronic effectthe rhicatalyzed double cyclization of bisallenylketones was realized to synthesize tnfa inhibitortype skeletons at rt in acetone or dce as compared with pdclmecn rhclco shows an excellent selectivity referred to the nonaromatic cc bond due to the different bonding nature of palladium and rhodium towards the carbon or oxygen in the involved organometallic intermediatesthe selectivity of unsymmetrical substrates has been controlled by the electronic effect   studies on highly stereoselective additionelimination reactions of methoxycarbonylallenols with mxstereoselective synthesis of conjugated dienes is of current interest since they are very important intermediates in organic synthesis it was observed that the reactions of functional allenes may afford dienes but usually with poor stereoselectivity methoxycarbonylhalozdienes can be prepared highly stereoselectively via sn’type additionelimination reactions of methoxycarbonylallenols with mx nai libr·ho or licl·ho these products may easily undergo negishi or sonogashira coupling reactions to yield a series of stereodefined polysubstituted edienes   highly selective synthesis of methyl ethynylalkeenoates and ’chlorovinylalkzenoates from methoxycarbonylallenolshighly regio and stereoselective reactions of readily available methoxycarbonylallenols with oxalyl chloride in the presence of etn or dmso can afford methyl ethynylalkeenoates and ’chlorovinylalkzenoates respectively in moderate to good yields create a free website powered by ✕ youqian deng  researcher profile  symptomacom close login email

alia under nos  on october   old navy and  on january   oldnavycom similar trademarks were registered in china since  according to the documentary evidence and contentions submitted the old navy brand was first divulged in  when the first old navy store was created in california to sell casual apparel and related products complainant operates a website under the domain oldnavycom which was registered in  according to the documentary evidence and contentions submitted respondent registered the domain names babygapclothingcom biggapcom gapcouponcom and gapfashioncom on october   october   march   and october   respectively the domain name bananarebuliccom on november   and the domain name oldnavyreidsystemscom on october   on december   complainant sent a cease and desist letter to respondent complainant states that respondent never replied  parties contentions a complainant complainant contends that i the disputed domain names babygapclothingcom biggapcom gapcouponcom and gapfashioncom are identical or confusingly similar to complainants trademarks because they incorporate the gap and baby gap trademarks with the addition of generic words such as “clothing” “fashion” “coupon” and “big” thus suggesting an association with complainant ii the domain name bananarebuliccom is confusingly similar to complainants registered trademark because it only differs from banana republic trademark by a minor typographical error and iii the domain name oldnavyreidsystemscom is confusingly similar to complainants registered trademarks because it combines complainants old navy trademark with the reid systems trademark complainant further contends that respondent does not have rights or legitimate interests regarding the disputed domain names because i respondent does not hold any trademark registrations which are identical similar or related to complainants marks ii respondent is not an authorized dealer distributor or licensee of complainant iii the disputed domain names are not the ones that respondent would choose in the context of providing goods or services other than to create an association with complainants marks and ii respondent has not used the disputed domain names in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services since they are used in connection with clickthrough advertisements finally complainant contends that respondent registered and is using the disputed domain names in bad faith because i respondent was certainly aware the gap banana republic and old navy trademarks since they are well known and registration of domain names containing wellknown trademarks constitute bad faith per se ii respondent aims to capitalize and freeride on the fame and reputation of complainants marks and iii respondent has shown a pattern of bad faith conduct because of respondents registration of over  domains that are substantially identical to third party trademarks b respondent upon receipt of the centers notification of complaint and commencement of administrative proceeding respondent sent an email to the center stating that “respondent never heard of complainant therefore those domains could not have been registered in bad faith” the center advised respondent that the response due date was march   however respondent did not file a response to complainants contentions it is clear therefore that respondent chose not to file a response  discussion and findings a laches the panel notes that the disputed domain names were registered in the period of october  to november  and that the complaint was filed on january   the question which arises is whether the elapse of around  years from the domain name registration date prevents complainant from commencing an administrative proceeding against respondent under the policy the panel recognizes that the issue has been addressed in previous wipo decisions and that the doctrine of laches or estoppel has not been applied to the policy proceedings “estoppel has rarely been raised as a defense in a proceeding under the policy and to this panels knowledge has never been the basis for denying a complaint when all elements of the policy were established” justice for children v rneetso  robert w osteen wipo case no d see also tax analysts v ecorp wipo case no d as decided in tom cruise v network operations center  alberta hot rods wipo case no d “without some substantial evidence to indicate that complainant approved of or condoned respondents use of his mark in the disputed domain name the panel is not prepared to import a bar against his cause of action” b effect of the default the consensus view is that the respondents default does not automatically result in a decision in favor of the complainant and that the complainant must establish each of the three elements required by paragraph a of the udrp wipo overview of wipo panel views on selected udrp questions para  however paragraph b of the rules provides that in the absence of exceptional circumstances a panel shall draw such inferences as it considers appropriate from a failure of a party to comply with a provision or requirement of the rules this panel finds that there are no exceptional circumstances for the failure of respondent to reply to all of complainants contentions by submitting a complete response therefore asserted facts that are not unreasonable will be taken as true and respondent will be subject to the inferences that flow naturally from the information provided by complainant reuters limited v global net  inc wipo case no d rx america llc v matthew smith wipo case no d the panel will now review each of the three cumulative elements set forth in paragraph a of the policy to determine whether complainant has complied with such requirements c identical or confusingly similar the panel concurs with the opinion of several prior wipo udrp panels which have held that when a domain name wholly incorporates a complainants registered trademark that may be sufficient to establish confusing similarity for purposes of the policy see eg eauto llc v triple s auto parts dba kung fu yea enterprises inc wipo case no d magnum piering inc v the mudjackers and garwood s wilson sr wipo case no d kabushiki kaisha hitachi seisakusho dba hitachi ltd v arthur wrangle wipo case no d oki data americas inc v asd inc wipo case no d bayerische motoren werke ag v bmwcarcom wipo case no d dr ing hc f porsche ag v vasiliy terkin wipo case no d adidassalomon ag v mti networks ltd wipo case no d att corp v william gormally wipo case no d that is particularly true where the trademark is highly recognizable and famous as in the instant case in fact complainant has provided sufficient evidence that the trademarks gap and old navy are famous each of the domain names biggapcom babygapclothingcom gapcouponcom gapfashioncom and oldnavyreidsystemscom incorporates the whole of the famous gap or old navy trademarks as the case may be and therefore may lead the public to think that the disputed domain names are somehow connected to the owner of the registered trademarks utensilerie associate spa v c  m wipo case no d in addition it has been decided that the addition of generic or descriptive terms to an otherwise distinctive trademark name does not elimminate confusing similarity to the registered trademark vs vinsprit ahb v giovanni pastore wipo case no d thomson broadcast and media solution inc thomson v alvaro collazo wipo case no d sanofiaventis v usmedscom wipo case no d f hoffmanla roche ag v pinetree development ltd wipo case no d the words “clothing” “fashion” “coupon” and “big” are in the context of complainants goods generic and do not generally affect a finding of similarity where a registered trademark is incorporated into a domain name as a matter of fact the combination of “gap” or “baby gap” with “clothing” “fashion” “coupon” or “big” creates an immediate potential for false association with the gap trademark and brand name and a high degree of initial confusion see adidassalomon ag v digi real estate foundation patrick williamson wipo case no d as decided in yahoo inc and overture services inc v registrant  aka gary lam aka birgit klosterman aka xc aka robert chua aka registrant wipo case no d “the addition of other marks does not create a distinct markdomain name capable of overcoming a claim of confusingly similarity it merely adds to the potential confusion of internet users as to the source sponsorship and affiliation of the domain name” see also pfizer inc v martin marketing wipo case no d therefore oldnavyreidsystemscom is confusingly similar to complainants old navy trademark even with the addition of “reid systems” the domain name bananarebuliccom is confusingly similar to the banana republic trademark because only some letters have been interchanged the practice of misspelling an element of the mark generally called “typosquatting” has consistently been regarded as creating domain names confusingly similar to the relevant mark see eg reuters limited v global net  inc wipo case no d playboy enterprises v movie name company wipo case no d deutsche bank aktiengesells v new york tv tickets inc wipo case no d hobsons inc v peter carrington aka party night inc wipo case no d rosssimons inc v domaincontact wipo case no d sharman license holdings limited v iceditcom wipo case no d accor v brigit klostermann wipo case no d finally the addition of the suffix “com” is nondistinctive because it is required for the registration of the domain name rx america llc v mattew smith wipo case no d sanofiaventis v us online pharmacies wipo case no d therefore the panel finds that the requirement of paragraph ai of the policy is met d rights or legitimate interests respondent is using the disputed domain names to resolve to websites with clickthrough advertisements pointing to complainant as well as to other websites including those competing with complainant and those offering services unrelated to complainants products the websites to which the disputed domain names resolve are entirely in english the issue as to whether use of a domain name for purposes of offering “sponsored links” creates a legitimate right to a domain name has been addressed in previous wipo udrp decisions there is a consensus view that except in certain limited circumstances such use cannot be considered a bona fide offering of goods or services or a noncommercial or fair use see bridgestone corporation v horoshiy inc wipo case no d deutsche telekom ag v dong wong wipo case no d prl usa holdings inc v lucascobb wipo case no d in fact the panel sees no plausible explanation for respondents adoption and use of the terms “gap” “old navy” and “bananarebulic” in the disputed domain names and accordingly concludes that the disputed domain names were selected and used by respondent to take advantage of the notoriety associated with the gap banana republic and old navy names with the intent to attract for commercial gain internet users see madonna ciccone pka madonna v dan parisi and madonnacom wipo case no d in short complainant has satisfied its burden of providing sufficient evidence to make a prima facie case showing that respondent lacks rights to or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names and respondent has failed to provide the panel with any of the types of evidence set forth in paragraph c of the policy from which the panel might conclude that respondent has any rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names berlitz investment corp v stefan tinculescu wipo case no d in light of the foregoing the panel finds that the requirement of paragraph aii of the policy is met e registered and used in bad faith i bad faith because of the fame of the gap banana republic and old navy trademarks complainants first contention of bad faith is based on the argument that at the time of registration of the disputed domain names respondent knew or at least should have known the existence of complainants trademarks and that registration of a domain name containing wellknown trademarks constitutes bad faith per se the panel finds that in addition to gap and old navy the banana republic trademark has also acquired extensive and worldwide reputation and is to be regarded as a wellknown trademark as one panel held before “the complainants worldwide reputation and presence on the internet indicates that respondent was or should have been aware of the marks prior to registering the disputed domain name” caesar world inc v forum llc wipo case no d in light of the reputation of the gap banana republic and old navy trademarks it is clear that respondent in all likelihood knew of the existence of complainants trademarks in addition the panel concurs with previous wipo udrp decisions holding that registration of a wellknown trademark as a domain name is a clear indication of bad faith in itself even without considering other elements see veuve clicquot ponsardin maison fond ée en  v the polygenix group co wipo case no d pepsico inc v “null” aka alexander zhavoronkov wipo case no d pepsico inc v domain admin wipo case no d ii attempt to capitalize and freeride on the reputation of complainants marks complainants second contention of bad faith is based on the argument that respondent is using the disputed domain names to benefit from the reputation of complainants marks by redirecting internet users to sponsored listings of commercial websites of third parties some of which compete directly with complainant the panel has already found that that the disputed domain names were selected and used by respondents with the intent to attract for commercial gain internet users the panel concurs with the understanding of several other wipo udrp panels that the use of a domain name to point to a website that offers sponsored links to other websites is evidence of bad faith particularly if as in the instant case complainant had registered and used before famous trademarks muddusa llc v unasi incmuddproductscomdom wipo case no d volvo trademark holding ab v unais inc wipo case no d iii pattern of bad faith conduct complainants last contention of bad faith is based on the argument that respondent has shown a pattern of bad faith conduct by having registered over  domain names that are substantially identical to third party trademarks respondent has lost at least two udrp disputes before wipo in which bad faith has been found in each instance one of which involves the same parties to this case the gap inc v denq youqian wipo case no d earth products inc v deng youqian wipo case no d complainant also ordered a “reverse whois” search through markmonitor on december   containing the term “deng youqian” the search revealed that respondent has registered over  domain names many of which infringe third party trademark rights therefore the panel finds that respondent has shown a pattern of bad faith conduct and notes that respondent has done nothing to supplant that indication in light of all the conclusions and findings above the panel finds that the requirement of paragraph aiii of the policy is met  decision for all the foregoing reasons in accordance with paragraphs i of the policy and  of the rules the panel orders that the domain names babygapclothingcom biggapcom gapcouponcom gapfashioncom bananarebuliccom and oldnavyreidsystemscom be transferred to complainant manoel j pereira dos santos sole panelist dated march   palladiumcatalyzed oxidative

provided powerful and atomeconomical approaches to carbo and heterocycles– in particular oxidative carbocyclization strategies have been efficiently applied to total synthesis as a continuation of our research on the palladiumcatalyzed oxidative carbocyclizations of dienallenes and enallenes we recently developed palladiumcatalyzed arylating or borylating oxidative carbocyclizations of allenynes by using the corresponding arylboronic acid or bpinin connection with our previous studies on acetoxylationhydroxylationcarbocyclizations of dienallenes scheme  a we envisioned an oxidative acetoxylationcarbocyclization of allenynes  in the presence of hoaclioac with a simple pdii salt as the catalyst scheme  b based on the previously proposed mechanism  the reaction was expected to be initiated by allene attack on pdii through allylic ch bond cleavage followed by alkyne insertion to give acetoxylated triene product  however the reaction took an unexpected path and herein we report on a palladiumcatalyzed oxidative acyloxylationcarbocyclization of allenynes  to give acyloxylated vinylallenes  scheme  b an aerobic version of this transformation was also realized by using

likely βh elimination from less electrondeficient pdiv intermediate c may occurscheme  open figuredownload powerpoint slideplausible mechanisms for the palladiumcatalyzed oxidative acetoxylationcarbocyclization of allenyne one could also consider a mechanism through acetoxypalladation of the terminal cc double bond of the allene followed by insertion of the alkyne into the newly generated vinyl–pd bond and subsequent βh elimination to give acetoxyallene  for a detailed mechanism see the supporting information however with this mechanism one would not obtain any significant change of the ratio between vinylallene  and dimers with dideuterated species d a compared to nondeuterated  a since with this mechanism the ratio between the competing pathways leading to  and dimers would be determined in the first step without any possible isotope effect see the supporting information the low ratio of  between d aa and dimers from d a scheme  b therefore rules out this mechanism in contrast the two mechanisms proposed in scheme  via intermediates b and c respectively are in agreement with the results observed in equations – and scheme in summary we have developed a novel palladiumcatalyzed oxidative carbocyclization of allenynes in the presence of various carboxylic acids providing access to potentially synthetically useful acyloxylated vinylallenes during this carbocyclization a new cc bond a new co bond and a new allene structure are formed furthermore an aerobic version of this transformation using a catalytic amount of bq was developed to enhance the utility of this method according to the results of deuterium labeling experiments we propose that the reaction of the allenynes proceeds through competing propargylic and allylic ch bond cleavage pathways or via a palladaivcyclopentene intermediate with competing βeliminations further studies on the mechanism and synthetic application of this reaction are ongoingexperimental sectiontypical
