system sparton production system the sparton production system sps is our overall management philosophy the blueprint for our daily activities and the map for operating every aspect of our business it is the how that helps us accomplish our objectives and create value for our clients essentially everything we do as a company and every action we take is measured against the six elements of the sparton production system those elements are a commitment to safety safety is the foundation on which we’ve built our production system because we cannot function consistently and efficiently over time without it while there are several modules of safety in our sparton production system the following are just two specific examples risk analysis and mitigation ram matrix – using a likert scale to produce a numerical gauge of frequency likelihood and severity of risks so that we can be productive in reducing injuries on the manufacturing floor potential accidents i’ve noticed pain tracking – employees are encouraged to discuss issues immediately with supervisors and are also asked to submit a pain form – even if the shortterm issue has been addressed unique tracking numbers are assigned to each event and larger patterns and trends can reveal recurring safety issues next  a neverending effort to drive down cost as a contract manufacturer with hundreds of clients we are concerned not only with our bottom line but theirs as well we do this by continuously driving out inefficiencies and waste through our operations research and development engineering and manufacturing activities the general element of cost is segmented into three areas manufacturing engineering and strategy includes modules for manufacturing support processes such as lean enterprise planning capital expenditure authorization processes and capacity planning tasks rd and product engineering includes a focus on process and product innovation and automation and materials monitoring operational stability includes a focus on ensuring that financial resources are available when needed and optimized   next  a culture committed to the highest levels of quality we produce devices and products for the most demanding customers in the most highly regulated markets including medical  biotechnology military  aerospace and industrial  commercial their standards – and ours – are incredibly high because of what is at stake with the products we manufacture we build quality into every aspect of our company through design planning control and improvement we strive to be bestinclass in external ppm scrap rework cost   next  lean inventories and timely delivery the goal of delivery is to provide our clients with their products on time every time while eliminating excess inventory that can consume company cash that could be put to better use we manufacture only what is needed when it is needed and in the amount that is needed to benefit both sparton and our clients with savings   next  a commitment to our people a critical component to sps is our flexible capable and highly motivated team the success of our processes would not be possible without our dedicated people and we ensure that our client’s needs are best met through low employee turnover low absenteeism and bolstered by outstanding performance   next  a focus on the future it is important for sparton to not just serve its current clients but to also look for longterm profitable growth in a sustainable manner we are constantly seeking additional longterm mutually beneficial profitable relationships with other prospects next  ultra electronics ussi and sparton corporation joint venture for sonobuoy tech systems awarded m in foreign sales contracts sparton corporation agrees to be acquired by ultra
