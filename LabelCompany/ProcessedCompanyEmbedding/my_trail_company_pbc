the trail is my passion ed shonsey joshua bornhorst pathology professor jon bruce libby tomlinson mark wollam more investors more investors details expand all what are you building mytrail is a new company that’s starting with tremendous assets from golite a company that was in the outdoors market space for  years golite did a lot of things well and had a great following in  different countries selling peoples favorite ultralight collection of outdoor gear packs shelters sleeping bags outerwear mid layers base layers and accessories but golite isn’t around anymore because it opened physical stores that were too large and too costly to operate and added a large casual product line that was unprofitablewith mytrail were taking all of those wonderful customers and products of golite and concentrating on only the best and most popular clothing and equipment essentially were doing what was working and not doing what wasnt working we’re reclaiming the role of worldwide industry leader in lightweight outdoor gear what makes your brand different the heart and soul of mytrail is making products that not only function well and are durable but are also so light and compact that you can forget about the gear and remember why you went outside to begin with the second central element that the outdoor industry hardly addresses is delivering that premium lightweight equipment in as economical a way as possible we dont want our brand to be a badge worn at cocktail parties we want our gear to be the lightest most effective and most affordable for the quality how do you achieve affordability for customers we sell directly to customers by avoiding the traditional wholesale channel we eliminate the extraneous expenses and the savings we make from avoiding the middleman is passed onto customers the traditional wholesale model requires companies to make samples many months in advance that cost a lot to develop and produce companies also have to attend trade shows in other states and countries a booth at a large trade show can cost as much as a house and rep commissions cost a lot and wholesalers pass that cost on to the customer also what kind of advantages does your business model give you by avoiding the wholesale channel we are making products that people actually like and want there are no gatekeepers involved we hear from customers themselves what innovation they’re craving what makes sense for them and we can make it for them seeing the end customer enjoy our work is what we care about what makes your equipment special when people first walk into an outdoor store and look at the various equipment apparel and accessories the only cost they see is its price they buy what they want take it outdoors and use it then they realize that the most important cost isn’t actually price but the gear’s weight and secondarily its bulk those are the costs you pay not just once but with every single step on every single trip heavy overbuilt gear ruins your trip we concentrate on making the lightest gear possible by eliminating extraneous elements thoughtful design is lightweight and durable our mission is to make gear elegantly simple and so light users forget they’re even carrying a load on their back and can focus on enjoying the outdoors what sets you apart from competitors first our relentless focus on making our products as light and packable as possible while delivering supreme performance and solid durability second our directtoconsumer sales model that allows us to eliminate many traditional costs and deliver products affordably to customers internally we call this combination “great products at great prices” which is what virtually all customers want and we will deliver great products at great prices over a wide range of outdoor product categories from packs to tents to sleeping bags to technical outerwear mid layers base layers and accessories which creates uncommon synergy and allows new customers to transform their overnight loads from the typical  pounds to less than  what are the companies who are making competing products there are many companies in the outdoor market most are small with narrow product lines there are also a few larger brands that make products in all the categories my trail will make products in in the us these include the north face and rei while there are other brands whose products are as high performance as my trail’s and some that make products as sustainably as my trail none achieve the combination of light weight and low cost that my trail does tell us about the market the outdoor recreation market is worth  billion in the us annually and the market specifically for outdoor clothing and equipment is  billion combined leading international markets are even greater than these us figures why dedicate the last  years of your career to this niche i want more people to go out and not only experience but truly enjoy the outdoors the way it is now traveling outdoors can be a hassle and a buzzkill for ordinary folks lugging around heavy overbuilt gear isn’t fun we want to take that experience and remove the burden you should enjoy the outdoors the relationships you make with others and the natural beauty all around youi’ve experienced the overburdened trip and ive also experienced the joy of going light and not noticing the load on my back at all everyone i know who has had that experience of going light goes out more often enjoys it much more and is refreshed and excited each time what are you selling right now we start selling our most popular packs shelters and accessories in late may and our most popular down jackets and parkas in july how are you tackling manufacturing the final cutandsew for our first products is concentrated at leading manufacturers in vietnam and china historically the products were making have had plenty of inputs and cutandsew in the united states canada japan korea taiwan france and other countries we are also working with a strategic partner based in new jersey that has a global management footprint in outdoor production they work with large customers including under armour for which they were the first outside supplier using their suppliers we’ve saved about  on equipment and about  on apparel costs while marginally improving product quality which was already very high that cost savings allow us to have a healthier and stronger company while delivering terrific value to our customers what do the margins look like on your products generally we go into a season with average starting margins in the  range which is very high for our industry discounts to investors our team and group purchases will reduce that by several points and we have modeled a  margin into our finances we think we can beat that every season how do you plan to activate current customers and acquire new ones we start with over  customers on our email list for every item we have produced for our st month season so our early focus is on serving current customers by making the products they like most and letting them know when they arrive even in our rd year we plan to make fewer items than we have customers to buy them our st  years our main focus on acquiring new customers will be via wordof –mouth what lessons from golite are you bringing into mytrail the biggest are  to make only the products that truly matter to our customers the technical apparel and equipment that sold best and was solidly profitable and  to sell those core product groups online and in small stores modeled on the smallest of golite’s stores which was the reliably profitable size others are detailed in our investor presentation video tell us about the team and why you’re the people to make this happen mytrail is starting small with a very tight team so far there’s kale klontz our chief operating officer kales terrific at retail operations hiring and management and we’ve added thomas dangerfield as our chief marketing officer thomas was actually one of our earliest investors so he brings his knowledge not only of how to build our brand as an expert but as a user we have  great outside directors on our board who have already added lots of value in sourcing merchandising and strategy what are the big risks what keeps you up at night we’ve worked hard to manage away most risk by making only our best selling and most profitable products and selling them in only the universally profitable store formats online and small physical footprint under  square feet our focus is and will remain on excellent execution of this basic formula by nature i don’t sleep a lot anyway so i wouldnt say that keeps me up at night but thats what i work on at night why allow your customers to invest in your business any business benefits from having investors who truly care about it and understand it they’re the ones best positioned to point out both pitfalls to avoid and opportunities to seize we’ve had over  customers invest so far in colorado and they’ve suggested great ideas posed key questions and provided contacts that have proven very useful it’s been a joy i look forward to experiencing that more and more as this base of customersturnedinvestors expands beyond colorado to the rest of the country read all answers view all questions ask a question risks specific to my trail  my trail is a new company with a short operating historymy trail incorporated april   and its first products arrived in late may  therefore we have little direct operating history for an investor to evaluate there is no assurance that we will ever produce a profit as a new enterprise we may be subject to risks our management has not anticipated it is possible that the proceeds from this offering may not be sufficient for us to continue to finance our operations  my trail may fail for the same or similar reasons that golite failedmy trail’s founders previously started golite and the products that my trail plans to sell and the markets in which my trail plans to operate are similar to products that golite sold and the markets in which golite operated although golite grew for a period of time it was not able to attain profitability and was forced to file a petition in bankruptcy court and ultimately liquidated its assets with owners of the company the founders losing all of their investment there is no guarantee that my trail will succeed where golite failed or that the founders have learned and can apply every critical lesson from their experience at golite  my trail may not attract or retain a strong enough teammy trail employs  people each of whom have broad responsibilities there is no guarantee that the company will attract an adequately strong team in all key functional areas over time until scale allows for solid hires in all key functional areas generalists in some cases working with outside parties will have to continue to successfully manage design development sourcing marketing sales ecommerce store operations customer service information technology human resources distribution and finance which could result in inefficiencies and mistakes attracting hiring and developing each team member into a high performer will take time and there is no guarantee of success  my trail may not attract enough customersmy trail may not be able to convert an adequate portion of its email list of previous golite customers into my trail customers even if it does there is no guarantee that adequate numbers of new customers will be attracted in the future  my trail sales are weather and macroeconomy dependentlike other outdoor companies my trail sales are subject to the influence of weather early sales will be concentrated in the united states in general and colorado in particular and may fluctuate with large climactic events andor persistent trends sales can also be affected by the normal cyclicality of the overall economy and particularly by any abnormally large decline in it  my trail may not have sufficient financial resources to compete in the outdoor industrymany companies provide products similar to ours my trail will compete with established businesses that have an operating history and greater financial resources experience and market share than we have there is no guarantee that we will be able to compete or capture adequate market share we will not be profitable if we cannot compete successfully with other businesses cash flow may be tight early on with a limited margin for error  my trail may not develop compelling enough productswhile my trail starts with a full line of product designs many styles need to be refreshed periodically new styles have to be added and some styles retired each season there is no guarantee that this process will result in an attractive enough product offering over time much of the design work may be performed by outside contractors over whom we have little control  my trail may not be able to source its products reliably or affordably enoughmy trail could face unexpected product cost increases that make its economic model unviable delays in production shipping or customs clearance could materially impact product delivery and thus customer experience and cash flow product can be lost or damaged in transit product that is designed developed or assembled poorly could adversely affect sales due to poor quality fit or color selection our products may not meet the sustainability standards that we claim they will meet which could result in harm to our reputation  my trail may not be able to contain operating costs adequatelysufficiently economical store and headquarters locations may not be available key staff could cost more than budgeted and unanticipated costs may arise cash flow may be impacted by a failure to get reasonable terms from landlords product and other suppliers  there is no market in my trail shares and no guarantee that investors will realize any return on their

sawyer mini water filterpacking for kilimanjaro – hikers review on levin solstar giant my trail company new company launch recently hikers review got the opportunity to communicate by email with kale klontz from my trail company mr klontz was a key member of the former outdoor equipment company golite in the fall of  golite ran into financial difficulties due to poor economic conditions that forced golite to file for chapter  for those that are familiar with the backpacking and hiking scene will recognize the golite logo and variety of high quality outdoor equipment some of their most popular items offered by golite were the imogene tents jam pack backpacks and the chrome dome umbrella of which hikers review will be releasing product reviews on both imogene and chrome dome umbrellas we will identify reasonable replacements on our website due to the inability to obtain these items from the former company golite it’s important to note that the new business “my trail company” is operated separately from the former golite company with no financial ties my trail company will be operating with new staff and business partners even though they will retain many of the same intellectual properties that the former golite company previously used for their products so what does this mean for the consumer and golite fans in general this means that majority of the favorite products will return to the market under a new company and product name but with no association with golite my trail company will have a focus on lightweight outdoor equipment according to mr klontz “that will help consumers have more fun on the trail” with the main focuses on activities such as backpacking hiking skiing running and fitness that can be used by the extremely dedicated to the weekend trail casuals for people worried about seeing a return of a favorite design or be the first to showoff the new my trail company hiking equipment you will have to keep waiting “we are working with fabric suppliers and manufactures to determine what specific designs and products can be produced initially  the number of styles and units in the first few productions will depend greatly on our initial capital raised and what negotiations we are able to make on minimum order sizes” want to help support the next outdoor apparel company mr klontz said “there is much work in progress and many details yet to complete such as a capital raised through crowd funding dpo direct public offering that will launch in the coming weeks and may take several months – available to colorado residents only”   sorry america it looks like you need to sit back and wait for colorado to fund the start of my trail company hikers review will continue to follow up on new developments and

colorado reply this format is exactly why golite went under poor business decisions not poor economic conditions ha good luck reply want to help support the next outdoor apparel company mr klontz said… here’s to hoping that the new product lines are more equipment related than apparel equipment was golite’s strong points and apparel is what got them into trouble thanks for reading reply leave
