us prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in men there were over  new cases and  deaths reported in the us in the year  american cancer society the frequency of patients presenting at each stage of disease has changed remarkably with introduction of prostate specific antigen psa screening in the early sapproximately  of patients with prostate cancer will present with regional or metastatic tumors while an additional  will develop metastases in the course of the disease metastases are commonly to the bone where the lesions can be seen on xray as osteosclerotic lesions or on a bone scan as areas of increased activity or “hot spots” in patients presenting with metastatic disease and receiving androgen ablation median survival is  years sternberg  in many such patients bone pain and decreased performance status are predominant relief from these symptoms is as important as prolongation of survival as a result assessment of these symptoms including pain has become a fundamental part of many prostate cancer studies and is an important new endpoint for monitoring the outcome of clinical trials in this diseasepain in patients with metastatic prostate cancer can be addressed by a number of therapies including radiation therapy surgery bisphosphonates or opioid medication each therapy having its own significant disadvantages prostate cancer patients will have a greatly improved quality of life if their pain is relieved controlled or simply stabilised especially because pain or pain progression can exasperate psychological factors such as fear or worries of nearterm deathpatients with metastatic disease are initially treated with hormone therapy such as luteinizing hormone releasing hormone lhrh agonists diethylstilbestrol des orchiectomy andor antiandrogens the development of hormonal resistance occurs in most patients after androgen deprivation the term “hormonerefractory prostate cancer” hrpc is used by physicians to describe prostate cancer disease that progresses despite castrate levels of serum testosteronethe median time to progression to hrpc is  months from the time of initiation of hormonal therapy against prostate cancer responses to current second line hormonal therapies are temporary and do not impact upon survival the median survival after developing hrpc has been  to  months and until recently there was no clearly effective systemic treatment for this condition with recent advances in the understanding of hrpc novel treatment regimens are being identified in the past all treatments involving cytotoxic chemotherapy were considered inactive but newer chemotherapy drugs and drug combinations are now demonstrating improved response rates kelly  and improved survival petrylak  eisenberger evaluation of tumor response in advanced prostate cancer has been difficult due to the predominance of nonmeasurable bony metastases and the infrequent presence of measurable lesions more recently psa level has been used to evaluate the disease status of patients with prostate cancerpsa level is generally considered to be a useful surrogate measure in patients receiving hormonal therapy bubley  miller  and it may be useful as well in patients receiving therapy for hormone refractory disease bubley  kelly  there may be limitations for use of psa levels to monitor disease in this population however since any new therapy may modulate psa production by tumor cells independently of its effect or lack of effect on tumor growth eisenberger satraplatinsatraplatin innusan also known as jm or bisacetatoammine dichlorocyclohexylamineplatinum iv is a member of a novel class of platinum iv compounds that are absorbed by the oral route the lipophilic properties of these compounds and hence their absorption are largely determined by the nature of the axial acetate ligands unlike the square planar platinum ii complexes cisplatin and carboplatin satraplatin is an octahedral platinum iv compoundthe molecular formula for satraplatin is chnclopt its molecular weight is  its chemical structure is satraplatin can be synthesised according to the method disclosed in us pat nos  and  or by appropriate modification of the method disclosed in us pat no upon administration of satraplatin to a cell animal or a human patient a number of metabolites may be formed fig  taken from raynaud et al  cancer chemother phamacol   shows exemplary metabolites of satraplatin jm and depicts jm jm jm jm and jmdifferences between satraplatin and other platinumcontaining therapeutic agentssatraplatin is a thirdgeneration platinum compound studied in a variety of tumors since their original discovery platinum compounds cisplatin carboplatin oxaliplatin have emerged as important agents for the therapy of several human tumors including testicular bladder lung colorectal head and neck ovarian and cervical cancer rozencweig  loehrer  prestayko  cisplatin used as single agent has been evaluated in several trials for the treatment of hormone refractory carcinoma of the prostate eg rossof  merrin  yagoda i yagoda ii qazi  soloway  moore  the primary endpoints in these studies were response rate in measurable disease the response rates to single agent cisplatin are generally low or poor see below and comparable to those seen with other agents in this disease rossof  yagoda  furthermore cisplatin was repeatedly shown not to be effective against prostate cancer qazi  khandekar am j clin oncol    demonstrated in a phase ii trial that cisplatin is not effective in patients with metastatic prostatic carcinoma hasegawa et al cancer  chemother    reported that the range of effective dose was wider for other platinum agents like carboplatin than for cisplatin even in combination treatment cisplatincomprising regimens demonstrate limited activity eg in combination with mitoxantrone in metastatic prostate cancer osborne et al eur j cancer    therefore cisplatin has not been established as compound for chemotherapy of prostate canceralthough i preclinical studies with satraplatin demonstrated cytotoxic and antitumor activities comparable to cisplatin or carboplatin and ii early clinical studies demonstrated its activity against platinumsensitive tumors of the ovary and lung in addition to the prostate satraplatin shows considerable and significant differences to other platinum agents like eg cisplatin it has shown activity in some platinum resistant tumor models in vitro and unlike other platinum compounds it is absorbed when administered orally using a panel of ovarian cancer carcinoma cell lines kelland et al cancer res    demonstrated that satraplatin is significantly more cytotoxic than cisplatin and that satraplatin exhibits selective cytotoxic effects against intrinsically cisplatinresistant cell lines loh et al br j cancer    confirmed these findings loh et al furthermore came to the conclusion that the increased accumulation of satraplatin which is a result of its enhanced lipophilicity accounts for the dramatic increase of the potency of satraplatin over cisplatin other studies reporting on the activity of satraplatin towards cell lines with acquired or intrinsic resistance to cisplatin are those of mellish et al br j cancer    using human cervical squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and orr et al br j cancer    using murine leukemia cell lines in the latter report the cell lines used were not just resistant to cisplatin but also to tetraplatin and carboplatintwentyman et al cancer res    investigated the sensitivity of human lung cancer cell lines with acquired or inherent resistance to cisplatin to a series of novel platinum compounds including satraplatin in this study cisplatin and carboplatin were found to act very similar whereas satraplatin did notin spite of different routes of administration kelland et al int j oncol    demonstrated the surprising finding that the efficacy of orally administered satraplatin is comparable to that of cisplatin and carboplatin administered intravenously as determined in human ovarian carcinoma xenograft models these findings were confirmed by rose et al cancer chemother pharmacol    using murine and human tumor models mckeage et al cancer res    investigated the differences of the schedule dependencies associated with these routes of administrationin another study by kelland et al cancer res    many of the above mentioned differences between satraplatin and cisplatin were confirmed furthermore it was found that the cytotoxicity of satraplatin was dependent on the time of drug exposure again it was confirmed that satraplatin does not exhibit cross resistance to cisplatin whereas other platinum agents eg tetraplatin do without being bound to any particular theory satraplatin circumvents transportdetermined acquired resistance to cisplatinmellish et al cancer res    investigated the mechanisms of acquired resistance to satraplatin in two human ovarian carcinoma cell lines they found that in contrast to cisplatin acquired resistance to satraplatin is not mediated through reduced drug accumulation but by increased intracellular gsh levels or increased dna repair sharp et al clin cancer res    compared the transport of cisplatin and satraplatin in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines cisplatin transport in the parental cell lines occurs via passive diffusion and activefacilitated transport whereas in a cisplatinresistant cell lines cisplatin enters cells by passive diffusion only without being bound to any particular theory satraplatin circumvents cisplatin resistance by increasing the drug uptake the mechanism of satraplatin transport across cell membranes is through passive diffusion predominantly as a result of its enhanced lipophilicityfink et al cancer res    investigated the effect of the loss of dna mismatch repair activity on the sensitivity to cisplatin satraplatin and other platinum agents in contrast to cisplatin and carboplatin which form the same type of adducts in dna there was no difference in sensitivity between mismatch repairproficient and mismatch repairdeficient cell lines for satraplatinperego et al mol pharmacol    investigated the sensitivity of strains of schizosaccharomyces pombe to cisplatin satraplatin and other platinum compounds the panel of the  yeast strains tested comprised many mutants in genes that affect the response to radiation whereas the mutants fell into three groups with respect to their sensitivity to cisplatin minimal change in sensitivity hypersensitivity and

cell lung and colon carcinomas however the effectiveness of these compounds has been limited due to intrinsic or acquired resistance proposed mechanisms of cisplatin resistance include increased dna tolerance reduced cellular accumulation of cisplatin and enhanced cellular detoxification of platinum complexesvarious invitro studies show that satraplatin and jm are able to overcome several of the mechanisms of resistance to cisplatin including those attributed to alterations in the dna repair processes and platinum transport and to mechanism associated with the resistance of cancers to certain nonplatinum chemotherapeutic compounds in particular i satraplatin does not exhibit crossresistance to a number of cisplatinresistant cell lines and ii resistance mechanisms that confer resistance to nonplatinum based chemotherapeutic agents ie taxanes doxorubicin vincristine etoposide mitoxantrone and camptothecin generally do not confer crossresistance to satraplatin or jmkishimoto et al  mcr

against hormone resistant prostate cancera number of clinical studies have been conducted with satraplatin and the results of these are summarised in sternberg et al bju international  p  many of such clinical studies have investigated the pharmacology toxicology and other safety of satraplatin in human subjects others clinical trials have tested the efficacy of satraplatin against a number of different cancers the results of some of such clinical trials that set out to test the efficacy of satraplatin against hormone resistant prostate cancer have been published and are described belowstudy  a pilot multicenter openlabel phase ii study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of satraplatin as a singleagent for firstline treatment of patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer was conducted in the us peereboom et al proc am soc clin oncol  a   latif et al investigational new drugs    satraplatin was administered daily for  days every  weeks at a starting dose of  mgm per day an interim analysis peereboom et al proc am soc clin oncol  a  concluded that satraplatin is an active and convenient drug against hprc and has manageable toxicities whilst latif et al concluded that although satraplatin had moderate activity in hrpc it is associated with significant treatmentrelated toxicities in this patient population the trial however was openlabeled and hence any effect observed is confounded by placebo effectstudy  a multicenter randomized phase iii study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of satraplatin for firstline treatment of patients with hrpc sternberg et al proc am soc clin oncol   sternberg et al oncology   patients were randomized between satraplatin  mgm for  days plus prednisone  mg orally bid or prednisone alone after  randomized

satraplatin plus prednisone arm as compared to  months  cl  on the prednisone alone arm hr  cl  this randomized comparison of a combination of satraplatin and prednisone versus prednisone alone was suggestive of the antitumor activity of the combination it was concluded that a role for satraplatin in the treatment of hprc remains to be elucidated in an appropriate phase iii setting other factors and parameters like pain progression and psa levels were not followed up in this trial and no conclusion were made in these respectsclinical studies of the efficacy of satraplatin against cancerrelated paindespite a number of clinical studies using satraplatin have set out to investigate pain reduction or use pain as an efficacy endpoint including clinical studies of pain associated with metastatic hormone resistant prostate cancer no such clinical trial has so far shown a statistically significant effect on pain including stabilization reduction or alleviation of pain or elongation of time to pain progression in cancer patients by using satraplatincombination studies of satraplatin against canceras described above satraplatin has shown increased efficiency when used in combination with certain other chemotherapeutics in a number of preclinical models of cancer in certain earlyphase clinical studies satraplatin has been studied and when used in combination with the other therapeutics including paclitaxel jones et al invest new drugs    in certain studies of the efficacy of satraplatin against hormone refractory prostate cancer including that described as “study  above it has been used in combination with prednisone a corticosteroid such trials have been conducted as so called “twoarm” trails with one set of patients being treated with satraplatin plus prednisone and the other set of patients treated with placebo plus prednisone it has been considered unethical for clinical studies of hrpc to be conducted as “threearm” trials that is a trial in which a third arm is used to investigate and compare the efficacy of satraplatin alone plus a placebo for the prednisone hence it has been ethically impossible and shall remain so to investigate in clinical studies the potential synergy of such combinations by the use of such appropriate experimental designin summary there is substantive preclinical in vitro and in vivo information for satraplatin including information from in vitro or in vivo models for prostate cancer and there are substantive results obtained in various clinical studies using satraplatin in various oncology indications including as a firstline treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer in combination with prednisone based on these suggestive studies the sparc “satraplatin and prednisone against refractory cancer” phase iii clinical study described in the exemplification was started however while one could hope that the sparc trial would be successful one would not have had an expectation of actually achieving a statistically significant positive outcome in light of i the limitations in making predictions for clinical study results based on preclinical information ii the known failure

addictive naturethe challenges for any future hrpc treatmentdue to the favorable results of the trials that led to approval of docetaxel taxotere® for treatment of hrpc as firstline chemotherapy it is anticipated that the number of patients treated with chemotherapy in the firstline setting of this disease will increase substantially once hrpc fails such firstline chemotherapy subsequent treatment is needed for these patients currently there is no therapy approved for those patients for who the hrpc disease progresses despite such firstline chemotherapy patients who have a median survival of only around  months considering the extent of the unmet medical need in hrpc and following the approval of docetaxel for firstline chemotherapy the increasing number of hrpc patients in need of such secondline chemotherapy for hrpc there is an urgent need for new therapies that can show significantly significant effects in clinical trials of hormone refractory prostate cancer in patients who were treated with a firstline cytotoxic chemotherapy regimetreatment of the often excruciating pain associated with metastatic hormone resistant prostate cancer is one critical factor that would greatly benefit patients who have progressive hormone refractory prostate cancer who were treated with a firstline cytotoxic chemotherapy regime treatment of pain is generally more effective using regular pain medication rather than dealing with pain only when it breaks through and such prostate cancer patients will have a greatly improved quality of life if their pain is relieved controlled or simply stabilised especially because pain or painprogression can exasperate psychological factors such as fear or worries of nearterm deathany therapy for secondline hrpc that shows statistically significantly efficacy in clinical trials can lead to approval by fda or other international drugregulatory agencies and the introduction and use of such therapy on a larger scale such use has the potential to materially improve the prospects of lifeexpectancy or lifequality of many men throughout the world any therapy that would enable such sick men to conduct the remainder of their life with as much dignity and convenience as possible especially a therapy that could be practiced largely at home or in a more convenient setting would have great significance and be of immense advantage to
