tomas sedlacek and foreword by vaclav havel asks big questions about economic meaning and value in a clear and approachable style foreword by vaclav havel essayist and first president of the czech republic    economics of good and evil the quest for economic meaning from gilgamesh to wall street tomas sedlacek and foreword by vaclav havel description tomas sedlacek has shaken the study of economics as few ever have named one of the young guns and one of the five hot minds in economics by the yale economic review he serves on the national economic council in prague where his provocative writing has achieved bestseller status how has he done it by arguing a simple almost heretical proposition economics is ultimately about good and evilin the economics of good and evil sedlacek radically rethinks his field challenging our assumptions about the world economics is touted as a science a valuefree mathematical inquiry he writes but its actually a cultural phenomenon a product of our civilization it began within philosophyadam smith himself not only wrote the wealth of nations but also the theory of moral sentimentsand economics as sedlacek shows is woven out of history myth religion and ethics even the most sophisticated mathematical model sedlacek writes is de facto a story a parable our effort to rationally grasp the world around us economics not only describes the world but establishes normative standards identifying ideal conditions science he claims is a system of beliefs to which we are committed to grasp the beliefs underlying economics he breaks out of the fields confines with a tour de force exploration of economic thinking broadly defined over the millennia he ranges from the epic of gilgamesh and the old testament to the emergence of christianity from descartes and adam smith to the consumerism in fight club throughout he asks searching metaeconomic questions what is the meaning and the point of economics can we do ethically all that we can do technically does it pay to be goodplacing the wisdom of philosophers and poets over strict mathematical models of human behavior sedlaceks groundbreaking work promises to change the way we calculate

information tomas sedlacek lectures at charles university and is a member of the national economic council in prague where the original version of this book was a national bestseller and was also adapted as a popular theaterpiece he worked as an advisor of vaclav havel the first czech president after the fall of communism and is a regular columnist and popular radio and tv commentator economics of good and evil the quest for economic meaning from gilgamesh to wall street tomas sedlacek and foreword by vaclav havel reviews and awards sedlacek takes mainstream economics as his clay digging both his arms in up to the elbows in an attempt to explain the beliefs and ethical values underlying modern economics  the new york times there has long been a profound moral drive in czech culture seeking an ever larger view of the human and trying to break through conceptual barriers to do so in this sinewy and marvelous voyage of discovery tomas sedlacek calls us all to think more imaginatively more fully and more concretely about economics than we have done for many generations many thinkers including not a few economists will be stimulated to new explorations by this book michael novak author of the spirit of democratic capitalism economics of good and evil is an enchanting tour de force offering the general public an unusual erudite and riveting view of the world scientists and scholars can choose how to read this book either condemn it for its lack of a rigidly and traditionally scientific approach or accept it as an invigorating elixir providing inspiration and vision for further study i take it as the latter and i am certain the public will too  jan svejnar professor of business economics and public policy university of michigan tomas sedlacek proposes no less than a humanomics a view of our fate in this world of scarcity that takes account of human stories and philosophies economists have crippled themselves by their lack of scholarly breadth and their scientific disdain for human words sedlacek who ranges from the epic of gilgamesh to the movie the matrix cannot be accused of lack of breadth what is most impressive though is his depth drilling down into the soul of economics deirdre mccloskey author of bourgeois virtues ethics for an age of commerce and the cult of statistical significance economics of good and evil the quest for economic meaning from gilgamesh to wall street tomas sedlacek and foreword by vaclav havel from our blog from gilgamesh to wall street in economics of good and evil tomas sedlacek asks does it pay to be good in order to answer this question he looks at the way societies have reconciled their moral values with economic forces he explores economic ideas in world literature from concepts of
