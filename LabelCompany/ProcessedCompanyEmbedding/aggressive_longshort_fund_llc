long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline a longshort equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure while profiting from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions although this may not always be the case the strategy would be profitable on a net basis as long as the long positions generate more profit than the short positions or the other way around the longshort equity strategy is popular with hedge funds many of which employ a marketneutral strategy where the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal breaking down longshort equity while many hedge funds also employ a longshort equity strategy with a long bias such as  where long exposure is  and short exposure is  comparatively fewer hedge funds employ a short bias to their longshort strategy longshort equity strategies can be differentiated in a number of ways – by market geography advanced economies emerging markets europe etc sector energy technology etc investment philosophy value or growth and so on an example of a longshort equity strategy with a broad mandate would be a global equity growth fund an example of a relatively narrow mandate would be an emerging markets healthcare fund a popular variation of the longshort model is that of the “pair trade which involves offsetting a long position on a stock with a short position on another stock in the same sector for example an investor in the technology space may take a long position in microsoft and offset that with a short position in intel if the investor buys  shares of microsoft at  each and intel is trading at  the short leg of this paired trade would involve purchasing  intel shares so that the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal the ideal situation for this longshort strategy would be for microsoft to appreciate and for intel to decline if microsoft rises to  and intel falls to  the overall profit on this strategy would be  even if intel advances to  – since the same factors typically drive stocks up or down in a specific sector – the strategy would still be profitable at  although much less so to get around the fact that stocks within a sector generally tend to move up or down in unison longshort strategies frequently tend to use different sectors for the long and short legs for example if interest rates are rising a hedge fund may short interestsensitive sectors such as utilities and go long on defensive sectors such as health care trading center longshort

details on these and other risks inverse and leveraged funds are not suitable for all investors •these funds should be utilized only by investors who a understand the risks associated with the use of leverage b understand the consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results c understand the risk of shorting and d intend to actively monitor and manage their investments •the more a fund invests in leveraged instruments the more the leverage will magnify any gains or losses on those investments •inverse funds involve certain risks which include increased volatility due to the funds possible use of short sales of securities and derivatives such as options and futures •the funds use of derivatives such as futures options and swap agreements may expose the funds shareholders to additional risks that they would not be subject to if they invested directly in the securities underlying those derivatives •shortselling involves increased risks and costs you risk paying more for a

strategy may prevent a fund from correlating with the monthly quarterly annual or other period performance of its benchmarkdue to the compounding of daily returns leveraged and inverse funds returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the benchmark return for the same period for those funds that consistently apply leverage the value of the funds shares will tend to increase or decrease more than the value of any increase or decrease in its benchmark index the funds rebalance their portfolios on a daily basis increasing exposure in response to that days gains or reducing exposure in response to that days losses daily rebalancing will impair a funds performance if the benchmark experiences volatility investors should monitor

volatility in  alternative addressing market volatility in   tripp zimmerman  associate director of research tweet share feedback regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out or underperform market capweighted indexes over long periods we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles partly by tilting toward known return premiums in  value and size ie small caps underperformed but momentum quality and low volatility outperformed now the question is what factors will perform best in  and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market wisdomtree recently created the wisdomtree dynamic longshort us equity index wtdls designed to generate alpha at the core with a multifactor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically key features to wisdomtree approach wisdomtree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade typically focusing on signal factors such as value quality and size but now we are pleased to introduce this new multifactor approach the wisdomtree dynamic long us equity index wtdl is the long component of wtdls and comprises approximately  stocks with the highest combined fundamentals which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly • fundamental selection stocks are graded on a combination of growth quality and value factors and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion it is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another by combining quality and value factors which we believe complement each other we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term while still tapping into the longterm return premiums   • lowvolatility weighting in each sector the index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market we know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor so we believe applying it to a multifactor selection model will also add value   • sectorneutral capping the index targets a sectorneutral allocation when compared to the largest  us stocks by market capitalization we believe this keeps the index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or lowvolatility weighting to significantly over or underweight certain sectors we are confident about the stock selection and weighting process so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a capweighted index to get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process we compared wtdl against popular market capweighted style and factor indexes   index valuations for definitions of terms and indexes in the chart visit our glossary   • attractive across multiple valuation measures we find it impressive but not surprising that wtdl scored high on multiple valuation measures as of  wtdl had the highest dividend yield it also showed similar pricetoearnings pe ratios as the sp  value index both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value wtdl had the secondhighest quality metrics defined by return on equity roe and return on assets roa a very close second only to the msci usa quality index which focuses more directly on that factor lastly wtdl had higher profit margins than the sp  index and very similar growth expectations   dynamic hedging indicator the above table highlights how wtdl had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy for one thing the lowvolatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator the dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage so when the fundamentals or profits of the universe are deteriorating the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage similarly as valuations become more stretched adding risk to the portfolio the indicator would look to hedge as well while our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of  and signaled to be  hedge for january  making the net equity exposure for wtdls  or market neutral we believe the factor diversity and dynamic equity exposure this index provides deserve a second look given the recent market volatility and uncertainty for          sources
