into a separate company on tuesday it must now find a way to lift its growth amid stagnant sales and a tough marketxerox acquired the roots of conduent which handles everything from human resources services for healthcare companies to mobile parking apps for the city of los angeles by buying affiliated computer services for nearly  billion in  the deal was supposed to help xerox find another source of revenue beyond its core copier and printing businessbut like other big business tech companies like ibm and hewlett packard enterprise xeroxs overall revenue has declined in recent years with few people printing and copying xeroxs annual sales have dropped each year since during much of that time xeroxs business services group struggled in a ninemonth period ending in september conduent had  billion in revenue or nearly flat compared to the previous yearxeroxs executives say that two smaller more nimble businesses will be able to better adapt to a rapidly changing technology world the argument echoes that of hewlett packard which split into two companies last yearbut wall street didnt exactly give conduent a happy birthday in its first day of trading the companys shares fell  to in this edited interview with fortune conduent ceo ashok vemuri talks about splitting from xerox xrx competing with ibm ibm and hpe hpe and new beginningsfortune tell me about splitting from xeroxrelatedfortune amazon’s video content and india investments cause profit to fall fortune amazon’s video content and india investments cause profit to fall vemuri if you go back six to seven years when xerox acquired a company called acs affiliated computer services in  the thesis of that acquisition was that xerox was a hardware manufacturing company this was during a recession and management thought the best would be to serve your clients souptonuts if you will by acquiring a services companyit was very similar to other companies—think dell with perot  billion deal was announced in  hp with eds  billion deal was announced in  that construct of combining hardware with services didn’t necessarily pan out so it was thought that our two companies would be better served if they were sliced off and were allowed to control their own destiny and serve their own clients their own market their own technology etcget data sheet fortune’s technology newsletterwhy did hardware companies think that they also had to have business servicesit was the height of the recession this was considered a sort of natural hedge in terms of buying revenue secondly it was believed that if you sold a piece of equipment to a client they were servicing that equipment with somebody else so why would i not if i sold you that equipment service it instead thirdly services companies were on the ascendancy remember even  years ago print paper ink was on decline and it continues to be so the services business is where the margins are—where the cash flow is—and your need for spending is much less if you look at an equipment provider like xerox it’s more a finance operating lease company because they fund your purchase of a printer a services business is asset light it does not require you to invest your balance sheet in a big waysome analysts believe the downside of a service company however are the costs of hiring employees which can eat into profitabilitythat’s wrong that is the conventional way of thinking about services businesses in our model  of our business is transactions based we do everything off the back of technology that allows me to add a multitude of services off a particular platform let me give you an example if i have three or four clients i cannot repurpose my people because they aren’t fungible i can’t say “hey for two hours you be on the call center for two hours you do transaction processing for two hours you work for client a and for two hours you work for client b” but i can do it if i do it on the back of technology because my platform aggregates and creates air pockets that allow me to work for multiple clients i can repurpose my platform to do multiple functions with people i can’t expect them to work more than eight hourswhat are the services that your company doeswe serve two broad segments one is the public sector we work with all  us states and over  government entities worldwide we do a lot of work in transportation think about parking you use a parking app pay over the phone and the phone reminds you after  minutes to pay more we are now handling road tolls—so think easypass in california and sunpass in floridawe are the world’s largest prepaid card processor we do things like welfare social security food stamps the other part of the business is commercial we work with  of the top fortune  companies we support them on missioncritical systemsapple aapl cofounder steve jobs once publicly criticized xerox for not capitalizing on its technologycorrect in a similar way a lot of conduent’s technology was invented in xerox over the last six years the acs story is six years old a little is left but a lot of that is new and a lot of that was invented in xeroxnow that you’re an independent company how do you balance spending on research into new technologies with pleasing investorsclearly today technology is at a place where you don’t necessarily have to build components inhouse you can buy them from others we have to rid ourselves of the sensibility we’ve had that if it’s not invented inhouse it’s not worth looking at we are now a public company so our research dollars have to give a return in the year that i give the dollar in unlike in the past in which the time to yield was like five to seven yearshaving said that technology will be the underpinning of every process we bring therefore we must invest in our technology platform and make it modern the speed of technology is changing and the way it is being consumed is dramatically changing in such a short time frame that our investments have to reflect that time horizon as well as the fact that these changes are happeningwho are your biggest competitorswe are in a wide range of industries so we have a lot of them a lot of them are very niche and specialized companies across our various businesses we see as competitors like accenture we see ibm we see hpe my advantage is i’m a pureplay business process provider i’m the largest in revenue and in size and scalefor more about enterprise technology watchhow do you distinguish yourselves from the big business services groups of companies like ibm that may brag that their technology separates them from the packtechnology is a commodity i can buy technology every other day at half the price i paid the day before yesterday the technology product isn’t going to give you any differentiation what gives you differentiation is what you do with that technology if i understand processes and have functional and domain knowledge then i can actually leverage that technology
