windowby frank l jaksch jr  february   at  amwhen new york state attorney general eric schneiderman accused major retailers of selling fraudulent herbal supplements consumers nationwide were thrown for a loop indeed there have been questionable dietary supplements on the market in the past but by such large and trusted brands many consumers find themselves wondering if the attorney general was accurate in his allegations raising the question of whether they can continue to blindly trust these major retailers there has been a great deal of criticism about the testing method — dna barcoding — used by the attorney general in his investigation and in fact this was a poor choice dna barcoding in and of itself is not flawed but the method of testing needs to be appropriate for what is being tested would a physician perform a colonoscopy in order to diagnose arthritis botanicals in dietary supplements tend to exist in two forms raw herbs or extracted botanicals in order for dna barcoding to work accurately the dna would need to be intact as would be the case for raw herbs however with botanical powders the dna is more than likely compromised or even destroyed how can dna be tested if it is not present in the case of botanical powders dna barcoding would be ineffective at least some of the products in the investigation were likely made from extracts as such the attorney general’s dna assessment is partially correct but not entirely calling for microscopic analysis and validated chemical testing to achieve complete accuracy much of the debate in the media seems to have taken the form of either black or white — either the attorney general was completely right or completely wrong however this is not the case there is a great deal of gray here — while the method of testing did not identify ingredients that may have been present this does not address the fact that certain substances found were not included on the labels thus the fierce debate shouldn’t be over who is right and who is wrong while accurately testing the products is ultimately important as far as the consumer’s trust is concerned does it matter if the attorney general was  percent accurate or just  percent the bottom line is that this investigation ultimately raised serious questions about the quality of dietary supplements in order to regain consumer trust and provide top quality products as promised the industry must use an attack such as the attorney general’s as a catalyst for change the debate should lie in how what should that change be consumers should demand higher standards and the industry should deliver to ensure high quality products and to ensure that the fda’s current good manufacturing practices cgmp are met audits and inspections should be performed laboratory testing of ingredients and finished products should be implemented to confirm that they meet minimum testing requirements the reality is that if a finished consumer product even a welltested one was manufactured in a facility that is not fda cgmp compliant the product is adulterated these are just some of the ways the industry can hold itself to higher standards for the sake of consumers the involvement of major retailers has the power to finally prompt the dietary supplement industry to take the needed steps to earn the lasting trust of consumers as the investigation invades headlines
