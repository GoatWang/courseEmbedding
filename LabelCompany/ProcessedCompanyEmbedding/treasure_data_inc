data ramps up the speed at which we can prototype and try new things”adrian gligor head of technology mobfox mobfox has grown from a teenaged founder’s idea to europe’s largest mobile advertising platform in less than  years treasure data has been the foundation for their explosive growth analyzing  impressions per second get treasure datatreasure data helps an ad tech startup stay ahead of the game with a skeleton crewin business how a company manages its data can make the difference between success or failure nowhere is this more true than ad tech where data practically is the business on an ad server every bid impression or error that occurs must be captured and reported to each stakeholder accounting must know the final bid price on each impression in order to reconcile accounts bill advertisers and pay publishers publishers need to know which ads were shown alongside their content and to which viewers advertisers need reports on the context audience and performance of their campaigns all of this requires capturing and processing massive volumes of data in near real timebeforeafternavigating rapid growthin late  a lean engineering team at mobfox struggled to keep up as their mobile ad network blew past  billion events per day in less than  years mobfox focused on giving mobile publishers the highest degree of control over their ads which put data in an incredibly central role creating rich reports and advanced control panels was in fact their primary differentiator this turned out to be hugely successful leaving the tiny team scrambling to scale their infrastructure against massive growth they quickly hit the limit of their sharded mysql approach encountering numerous issuesdifficulty sizing servers for high peaktoaverage write loadshuge unwieldy connection pools to a central db serverhigh volume write loads causing buffer overruns during garbage collectionmost ad tech firms would have thrown a full data engineering team at the problem
