work with soyfoods by william shurtleff and akiko aoyagi a chapter from the unpublished manuscript history of soybeans and soyfoods  bc to the s šcopyright  soyinfo center lafayette california worthington foods is the largest and most innovative us company making meat analogs and vegetarian entrees they pioneered the development of spun soy protein fibers in meat analogs in the late s and early s their morningstar farms line of soybased meatless meats introduced into supermarkets and grocery stores nationwide in  and widely advertised provided millions of americans with their first experience of soy used in this way the founding  and founders the forerunner of todays worthington foods inc was special foods founded in  in worthington ohio by dr george harding sr a relative of us president warren g harding elwin knecht and bill robinson dr harding a seventhday adventist was head of the harding hospital a private psychiatric hospital that was founded by his father in  and followed adventist meatless diet and healing practices dr harding felt that the meat analogs especially protose then produced by jh kelloggs battle creek food company americas first producer of meatless meats were the best he had ever tasted being on the board of madison college in nashville tennessee which made its own analogs he knew it didnt take much to start a small food company he also knew that similar foods were being prepared in the kitchen of the adventistrun washington sanitarium in washington dc knecht a classmate of hardings at loma linda university in california and a graduate dietician had first learned how to make meat analogs in about  as a cook at the loma linda sanitarium by  he was foodservice manager for the harding hospital where he was known for his ability to make delicious meatless meats bill robinson an adventist friend and a patient of dr hardings lived in the community and was a former salesman for the battle creek food company he had sold meat analogs but had been laid off during the depression actually the prime motivation for starting the new company was to attract young families to the founders small church and church school by providing employment opportunities this would allow the school to grow to a viable size the project was launched in january  when dr harding borrowed  against the mortgage on his home the company started on a shoestring bill robinson was hired as the administrator and was the only salaried employee for the new company which was incorporated later that year as special foods inc in the little plant built to look like a colonialstyle house so that it could be sold as a home if the food company failed food manufacturing was done in the basement offices occupied the first and second floors and the storeroom was on the third product development was done when bj knecht would bring in new products for taste tests he had to be coaxed to write down his recipes so that they could be duplicated it was definitely a family operation twomley  the groups first product introduced in  was proast a dark glutenbased meatloaf analog made with wheat gluten peanuts and a little defatted soy grits or flakes it resembled battle creeks protose next came numete a light nutmeat loaf made with ground peanuts corn flour salt and yeast resembling battle creeks nutose another famous early product introduced in  was choplets the name had been suggested by hardings yearold son resembling dr millers cutlets choplets were made of wheat gluten and packed in a broth of yeast extract and mushroom broth they were a unique bestseller into the s served to patients at the hospital the new foods of which only proast contained soy were an immediate success sales grew to  by early  but bill robinson a salesman at heart did not enjoy the worries and pressures of managing a small company so he persuaded his old classmate jim hagle then assistant administrator of the hinsdale sanitarium at hinsdale illinois to consider working with the new company hagle agreed to come on board if harding would loan him the money to buy  of the companys stock the deal was made and it proved to be a turning point in worthington foods history robinson left in  hagle became secretary treasurer and manager and dr harding continued as president dr dale twomley dean of the andrews university school of business where hagle was a business major from  to  in an excellent biographical sketch of hagle described him as an uncommon businessman as president of worthington foods and administrator of harding hospital for  years he stepped carefully to avoid compromise in order to make more money a deeply religious man and a vegetarian as well as an excellent businessman and leader with high principles jim hagle played the key role in building worthington foods into the major company that it is today new developments in the s things soon began to happen at worthington foods after hagles first year sales had increased  to  during world war ii as meat was rationed and its prices soared there was a growing interest in meat analogs and several hotel and restaurant chains began to use worthingtons products but there was also strong competition from other adventist producers all of which were larger than worthington in  madison foods loma linda foods battle creek foods and dr harry millers international nutrition laboratory yet worthington soon took the lead in sales of meat analogs and in the areas of nutritional and technological research and product development this later became a prime factor in worthingtons growth and success in  two new soyfoods were introduced canned soybeans plain or with tomato sauce in ­or ounce cans and sandwich spread with chopped olives in ounce cans in  choplet burger the companys first product and meat analog with soy as a main ingredient was introduced sold in ounce cans it had a texture like hamburger plus the famous choplet flavor it could be shaped into patties and fried in  soy sauce purchased from another manufacturer was introduced in ounce table dispenser bottles  saw the introduction of both soyloin steaks great name made by mixing ground gluten pieces not suitable for the choplets with defatted soy grits or flakes then shaping the mixture into patties and of meatless wieners in a ounce can renamed vejalinks in  the soy in each of these products was generally defatted soy flour grits or flakes used both to complement the very low quality protein in wheat gluten and to work as a filling and binding agent in december  special foods which had operated during the war as a partnership including hagle and the harding family was incorporated as worthington foods inc in  when dr harding left to become president of loma linda university hagle became president of worthington foods by the end of the war sales were roughly  a year a fold increase in  years a new plant had to be built shortly after the war alan buller became general manager and warren hartman was hired as head of research they were among the core of good people who stayed with us through the years to whom hagle later attributed so much of the companys success soon the company developed their own sales force using men who were vegetarians and who used and believed in the products sales grew twomley  in september  robert boyer see chapter  visited worthington to discuss his new idea for spinning soy protein fibers and to offer them a license hagle was immediately excited with the idea but the company was reluctant to take a license until there was a source of soy protein fiber so boyer went on his way not to return for  years during this period worthingtons market was limited primarily to seventhday adventist members and institutions acquisitions and analogs  in june  worthington foods bought up half of its first competitor acquiring the rights to manufacture and market the meat analogs formerly produced by dr harry millers international nutrition laboratories including millers cutlets cutlet burgers and vegetable stew    none of which contained soy the rights to the rest of millers products including his bestselling soyalac soymilk and his plant in ohio were purchased by loma linda foods in  worthington began marketing its first soymilk soyamel sold in liquid form in pound cans instant soyamel was introduced in  using isolated soy proteins manufactured by the gunther co in illinois to give both an instant powdered and regular liquid product in plain and malt flavors sold in ounce pound and pound sizes this was the worlds first soymilk based on isolates in  a fortified instant soyamel was put on the market not thought of or marketed as an infant formula and in  a banana beverage soyamel other products containing soy introduced in the s were entree in tomato sauce  ounce can entree in mushroom gravy  ounce can meatless wiener  ounce can vp vegetable protein  oz or pound cans kreem chee natural white or pimiento  or ounce cans and fry sticks  indeed the s were a time of great innovation at worthington with new vegetarian soyfoods and also a period of largescale expansion of the business but worthingtons big break came in the late s with the decision to go ahead in developing robert boyers spun protein fiber idea into a new line of vegetarian meat analogs in  when boyer returned to america from england where he had been working with unilever on his fiber project he went immediately to worthington the company was now ready to buy the rights to his patent for the health food industry boyer was invited to work as a consultant in the lab at worthington and the result was over a period of several years the development of a new line of products beginning with chickenlike textures but the actual manufacture of these products presented difficulties for the only soy protein isolates the basic ingredient in the spun fibers then available were industrial grade products made without concern for bacterial levels or flavor boyer convinced ralston purina one manufacturer of industrialgrade isolates to invest in a new plant that made foodgrade soy protein isolates then spun them into fibers using boyers license it would have been too expensive at that time for worthington to spin their own fibers by  or  ralstons new plant was in production with a capacity of  pounds a day of fresh white fibers looking named like silky long ropes worthington agreed to take all this production although their market was not yet large enough yet according to hagle sales took off and we had hit a new product the adventists and the vegetarians thought it was great at worthington ralstons freshly spun fibers were cut mixed with binders such as egg albumen flavors colorings soy oil nutrients etc and made into meat analogs tests were showing that worthingtons familiar methods of canning their products were not working with the new spun soy protein fiber products they deteriorated in flavor and texture under the high canning temperatures so worthington made the bold complex and costly decision to sell the new analogs in frozen form yet it paid off sales increased sharply and by being the first to offer both the new spun protein products and any meat analogs in a frozen form worthington jumped ahead of its competitors by  years in  worthington foods began commercial production and marketing of its first new spun protein foods in the form of frozen chicken analogs fried chicken style was a deepfried product that resembled fried chicken and was sold in  ounce or  pound portions frozen or canned sliced whitemeat style resembling the white meat of chicken was packed in ounce portions or bulk rolls at about this same time the company began to use the word soyameat to refer to its canned meat analogs made from spun soy protein fibers by  soyameat came in the forms of fried chicken sliced chicken diced chicken sliced beef diced beef and salisbury steak it is interesting to note that the spun protein fibers were first used in meat analogs rather than simply as meat extenders worthington was also using increasing amounts of plain foodgrade soy protein isolates in its products starting in the late s both ralston purina and central soya had invited worthington to try their powdered isolates and some prototype food products soon worthington was using small amounts of the isolate in their gluten and nut products for both their functional and their complementary protein properties gradually the amount used was increased during the s worthington added only two new traditionaltype soyfoods to its product line patties  and numete  ingreds the same year worthington was making tofu but not on a commercial scale by now much of the line was labeled kosher in  worthington acquired the entire assets of dr john harvey kelloggs battle creek food company of battle creek michigan including the patents on various soybased meat analogs in  madison foods madison tennessee an adventistrun food company and competitor of worthington had been turned over to the adventist southern union association and become a division of the nutrition international corporation nic by  worthington had acquired nic and its pioneering subsidiary madison foods  largely because worthington wanted infasoy a liquid soy formula starting in  worthington began spinning its soy protein fibers buying its isolates from ralston purina and central soya then using a modified version of the process described by boyer in his landmark  patent ref worthingtons next big break came in  when stanford university ref sri published a special report on vegetable proteins as part of its service called presidents service in the report worthington foods was referred to as a leader in the field of meat analogs and its operations were praised extensively soon hagle began to receive calls and enquiries from many large companies from around the world worthington was facing growth pains realizing that there was a huge potential worldwide market for their products that as a small company they did not have the capital to reach this market and that if they did not do something much larger corporations would move in and take over the entire industry hagle finally decided he must choose one of four possible courses  work out a relationship that would make possible a merger with worthingtons biggest competitor loma linda foods  go public and raise stock to raise a large amount of capital  merge with some other company or  sell out altogether hagle favored the first plan which he felt would benefit the adventist church and end past rivalries yet after  years of negotiations no satisfactory agreement could be reached the church insisted on owning  of the stock in the new company and hagle felt that the church was not an appropriate institution to be running a big business hagle was disappointed in the outcome but other big corporations such as ralston purina quaker oats cocacola and staley were ready to offer ten times the companys book value to acquire it eventually however it was miles laboratories producers of alkaseltzer who offered the best price and terms including the guaranty that any product sold under the worthington brand would conform to adventist standards the big time then back home again s and s in march  miles officially acquired worthington foods which then became the glamour company of the industry sales at the time of the merger were about  million a year  years later they had reached  million a year and were growing rapidly during the s the research staff was expanded from  people to  and the research budget grew to about  million a year miles soon bought a large food production plant in schaumburg illinois with lots of frozen storage space and began to develop a new line of meat analogs for national distribution these were first sold commercially in limited test markets in  based on the response in  milesworthington introduced nationally their new line of textured soy protein breakfast meat analogs under the morningstar farms label the three initial products breakfast links breakfast patties and breakfast slices substitutes for sausage and ham were launched with a  million television advertising campaign although general mills had been on the market since the mids with bacos imitation bacon bits it is fair to say that the morningstar farms products represented the first line of modern meat analogs rather than condiments to be sold at supermarkets nationwide lublin  in the wall street journal documented miles soybean saga about  million american families tried the morningstar farms breakfast line in the first  months after its introduction in  but sales after that failed to measure up to the expectations lublin reported that miles had chalked up pretax losses of  million on its meat substitute products an improved version of the products was prepared in late  and again promoted nationwide with extensive advertising as cholesterol free no animal fat protein rich morningstar farms products found in supermarkets in  included breakfast links leanies grillers breakfast strips and luncheon slices but the morningstar line did not succeed while others acknowledged that milesworthington was probably  years ahead of its time promotion was gradually withdrawn and sales dropped as of  the future of the morningstar farms line was uncertain it may be dropped and worthington may go back to making foods primarily for the vegetarian market by the late s most producers of meat analogs agreed that the general market for these products in the us had been disappointing however the adventist or motivated vegetarian market continued to show an increase every year by  worthington produced over  varieties of meatless meats although no precise sales figures are available on the meat analog market size it was approximately  million a year in  worthington had about twothirds of this in late  bayer ag germanys huge maker of aspirin bought miles since bayer is fundamentally a chemical and not a food company and since they are dissatisfied with worthingtons profit performance what they will do with worthington remains uncertain by  miles was planning to pull out of the morningstar farms line they may try to place it in the natural food market like health valley products if worthington goes up for sale one potential buyer will be sanitarium health foods the australian adventist organization that since april  has run loma linda foods and granose in england in about  worthington introduced a new line of third generation meat analogs made using an entirely new and secret process in which apparently textured soy concentrates were used with or in place of spun soy protein fibers to give an improved texture the most popular of these were stakelets chik stiks and fillets fish analog then in  worthington expanded this new line to include readytoeat heatandserve vegetarian entrees including the bestselling veelets parmesano vegetarian lasagna pizza and stakes au sauce in  worthington manufactured and marketed three dry foods  canned foods and  frozen foods meat analogs the dry foods containing soy were regular and fortified soyamel and granbuger unflavored textured soy flour the more popular canned products containing soy were the various soyameat products prime stakes frichik sp chicken diced and beef sliced vejabits numete nonmeat balls vejalinks superlinks and saucettes popular frozen products containing soy as a main ingredient were stakelets chik stiks stripples sliced chicken and prosage these generally contained spun soy isolates or textured soy concentrates concl copyright  legal permissions policies privacy
