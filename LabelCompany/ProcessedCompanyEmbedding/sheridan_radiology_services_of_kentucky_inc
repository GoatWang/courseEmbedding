that is being assigned an npi codes are   person individual human being who furnishes health care   nonperson entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care for example hospital snf hospital subunit pharmacy or hmo is organization subpart n the is the organization a subpart question must be answered if the organization is a subpart the parent organization legal business name lbn and parent organization taxpayer identification number tin fields must be completed the parent organization lbn and tin fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is yes many organization health care providers who apply for npis are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities the parents here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for npis if so directed by their parents  the psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital the parent which is a legal entity the legal entity must obtain an npi the psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own npi if the hospital determines that it should  a group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations but each office is not a separate legal entity instead each office is part of the corporation the parent which is a legal entity the offices are examples of subparts that could have their own npis if the main location determines that they should  a pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them neither the pharmacy line of business nor the dme line of business represent legal entities instead both lines of business are part of an organization the parent that is a legal entity each line of business represents a different healthcare provider taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans the parentwe dont know who the parent is in this examplemust ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own npi provider organization name legal business name sheridan radiology services of
