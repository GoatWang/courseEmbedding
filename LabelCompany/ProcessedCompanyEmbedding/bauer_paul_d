infodidnt find what you were looking formagnifying glasshelpful reviews rothstein nathaniel djason  ratedann truly was heaven sent my original divorce was in another state pro se and i basically tied both my hands behind my back and didn’t even realize it it was a hard fight but there was absolutely no slacking on ann’s part i honestly believe the outcome of my custody issue was important to ann and legitimately cared ann provides a very reasonable rate based on your situation and she won’t seek to nickel and dime you every chance she gets she also won’t drag the case as long as possible in order to get more money understand as most things in life you can’t just throw money at her and then retire to the couch and expect a judgment in your favor simply put your results will be reflective of the effort you put in ann will always do the best possible with what you provide her you will have to provide accurate information to her and you will have to take ownership of your situation and do some work constantly keeping your case in the ear of the guardian ad litem by writing him or her keeping records of events and providing ann all the ammunition you can for her to make your case but she will not abandon you and will tell you exactly how and what you need to do she will still write anything that needs to be official and provide you with an opportunity to review before submitted she is the type of attorney that works for big boys and girls with a sense of personal responsibility and this is a huge tool she uses to keep her costs so reasonable make no mistake ann will make good on her end of the bargain she is at home in the courtroom mediation room and will ensure your side is heard loud and clear she has an uncanny way of arguing a case and maintaining the momentum the whole time maintaining the upmost in professionalism before your trial ann will give you advice of things you should or should not do you may not always fully understand why initially but follow it she knows what she is doing she never led me down a bad road and i know she won’t to you either ann was not a ghost when i needed to talk to her there were some times i had to talk to her as late as  oclock at night and at some points during my ordeal talked to her every day of the week i never paid  extra cent for those communications she really cared period ann always gave me an accurate assessment of the situation she didn’t lie or build up false hope then she fights like hell anyway making my argument if you are a dad with gumption that just wants what is fair or a hard working single mom who is being bullied in the courtroom by some high dollar legal eagle ann is right for you because of her my daughter is now out or a really bad situation and now has chance at a bright successful future ann was able to secure primary placement for one of my children and get enforceable fair visitation and rights for the other children i am honored to not only call ann my counsel but
