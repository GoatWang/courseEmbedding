contract loans are generally not taxable if taken from a life insurance policy that is not a modified endowment contract mec however when cash values are used to repay a loan the transaction is treated like a withdrawal and taxed accordingly unpaid interest on loans is added to the loan principal thereby increasing the total debt on the policy the combination of an increasing loan balance

accounts consist of subaccounts each of which invests exclusively in shares of a portfolio of an openend diversified management investment company registered under the  act each an underlying fund collectively the underlying funds currently allstate separate account i consists of  subaccounts northbrook life separate account consists of  subaccounts northbrook va consists of  subaccounts and northbrook va ii consists of  subaccounts several of the subaccounts available under the northbrook va contracts and the allstate contracts invest in the same underlying funds however those subaccounts each have different accumulation unit values due to the different charges imposed under those contracts each of the allstate contracts and northbrook contracts also offer one or more

proposed transactions a the merger northbrook will merge with and into allstate with allstate as the surviving corporation pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger and articles of merger collectively the merger agreement approved by the boards of directors of allstate and northbrook the merger is subject to approval by the insurance departments of arizona and illinois the states of domicile for northbrook and allstate respectively allstate and northbrook expect to consummate the merger including the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer on or about january   the effective date as a result of the merger allstate will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of the northbrook separate accounts and will become directly liable for northbrooks liabilities and obligations with respect to the northbrook contracts then outstanding each northbrook contract owner will become a contract owner of allstate by operation of law the merger will not affect the provisions of or the rights and obligations under the northbrook contracts moreover the merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the northbrook contracts nor will the merger affect the values determined under the northbrook contracts the merger will not affect any current allstate contract owners no charges will be imposed on or other deductions made from the northbrook separate accounts or allstate separate account i in connection with the merger in addition no payments will be required or charges imposed under the northbrook contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed no new investment options will be made available to owners of the northbrook contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated each subaccount of the northbrook separate accounts will continue to invest in the same underlying fund as that subaccount invested in prior to the merger the merger will not directly affect any of the underlying funds the underlying funds will not be a party to the merger or any related transaction the investment objectives policies and restrictions of the underlying funds will not be changed as a result of the merger or any related transaction no investment portfolios are proposed to be added to substituted by or terminated by the underlying funds in connection with the merger or any related transaction moreover the merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the underlying funds the underlying funds assets or the charges imposed on the underlying funds or their shareholders in addition the merger will not result in a change in the principal underwriter for the northbrook contracts allstate and northbrook have determined that no provision of the northbrook contracts or state law provides the owners of those contracts northbrook contract owners with any right to optout of or to vote on or otherwise consent to the merger rather the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies moreover none of the events affecting the northbrook separate accounts in connection with the merger require a vote of northbrook contract owners under the  act in addition as described above the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the northbrook contracts will not change except that allstate will become the depositor of the northbrook separate accounts consequently northbrook contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the merger after the merger allstate intends to accept additional payments under the transferred northbrook contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the northbrook contracts currently being offered but for the change in depositor allstate will administer the northbrook contracts in the same manner as did northbrook immediately prior to the merger all costs of the merger will be borne by allstate or an affiliate and not by any owners of northbrook or allstate contracts each a contract owner and collectively the contract owners b the separate account transfer pursuant to the merger agreement northbrook life separate account will transfer intact to allstate and become part of allstate on the effective date it will change its name to allstate life variable life separate account a and have allstate as its depositor rather than northbrook no other changes to northbrook life separate account will result from the merger the assets and liabilities that comprise northbrook life separate account immediately prior to the merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of allstate as the surviving company after the merger in addition northbrook life separate account will continue to fund the same contracts it did immediately prior to the merger c the separate account mergers pursuant to the merger agreement the northbrook va accounts will merge with allstate separate account i on the effective date to achieve administrative efficiencies and cost savings allstate will consolidate any duplicative subaccounts that invest in the same underlying fund the consolidation of the subaccounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each northbrook contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging subaccounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving subaccount the values of the exchanged interests under the contracts will thus be equivalent the accumulation unit values for these subaccounts will not change and the contract value of any affected contract owner immediately after the subaccount consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the subaccount consolidation the separate account mergers will not affect the subaccounts of the northbrook separate accounts that are not duplicative those subaccounts will remain intact within allstate separate account i and their net asset values immediately after the merger will be the same as they were immediately before the merger d the fixed account transfer pursuant to the merger agreement northbrook will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the northbrook mva contracts to allstate and allstate will assume northbrooks obligations under such contracts on the effective date as a result of the merger each nonunitized separate account of northbrook that funds the northbrook mva contracts will become a nonunitized separate account of allstate at the same time allstate will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of northbrook and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of northbrook under the northbrook mva contracts issued prior to the merger the fixed account transfer will not change the terms of the northbrook mva contracts except for the succession of allstate as the insurer under the northbrook mva contracts and it will not adversely affect the values determined under or the economic interests of the owners of those contracts e procedural matters allstate will file new registration statements on form n or form n as applicable under the  act to reflect the change in depositor of the northbrook separate accounts and allstates assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of northbrook under the northbrook va contracts and northbrook vli contract allstate will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date existing northbrook contract owners other than northbrook vli contract owners will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects allstates sponsorship of the northbrook separate accounts as a result of the merger new contract owners will receive a revised prospectus that reflects the change in depositor northbrook vli contract owners will receive a new form n prospectus that reflects the change in depositor allstate also will file new registration statements on form s under the  act for the northbrook mva contracts allstate will seek to have the registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date these new registration statements would reflect allstates assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of northbrook with respect to the northbrook mva contracts pursuant to the merger each person who owns a northbrook mva contract at the time of the fixed account transfer will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects allstate as the issuer of the contract new contract owners will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer in compliance with applicable state law allstate and northbrook will notify the owners of the northbrook contracts that allstate has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of northbrook under those contracts following the effective date allstate will not make offers or accept purchase payments under the northbrook contracts until the new registration statements filed with the commission are effective iii discussion for the reasons discussed below we are of the view that section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the proposed transactions we also are of the view as discussed below that section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer and that section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer or the separate account mergers finally we are of the view that the exemptive relief previously granted to northbrook and other named parties prior to the merger may continue to be relied upon after the merger by allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and the other named parties without the need for the filing or submission of amended or duplicative exemptive applications the staff has responded favorably to noaction requests dealing with the provisions of the  act and the  act noted above regarding transactions similar to the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer we respectfully submit that the proposed transactions are analogous to and pose no different issues than those presented in the transactions described in those noaction requests a section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the separate account transfer the separate account mergers or the fixed account transfer  separate account transfer in our view the separate account transfer would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of section  of the  act and rule  thereunder the separate account transfer would not change the northbrook vli contracts except that by operation of law allstate would succeed northbrook as the depositor of northbrook life separate account and coissuer of the contracts and would accordingly guarantee the rights and benefits provided by the contracts these rights and benefits eg surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc would remain the same but would be guaranteed directly by allstates larger pool of assets cash values under the northbrook vli contracts that are allocated to the northbrook life separate account would remain funded by the same pool of assets that presently constitutes the separate account and its subaccounts would continue to invest in the same underlying funds the unit values under the northbrook vli contracts offered by allstate life variable life separate account a immediately after the separate account transfer would be the same as under the contracts offered by northbrook life separate account immediately before the separate account transfer therefore would not affect those aspects of the northbrook vli contracts that cause interests thereunder to be treated as securities eg the investment options available through the separate account the separate account transfer would have no effect on the northbrook life separate account except for the succession of allstate as depositor and coissuer described above and except for the change in name of that separate account to allstate life variable life separate account a the assets and liabilities that comprise the northbrook life separate account immediately before the separate account transfer would remain intact and legally segregated from all other business of allstate the financial history of the northbrook life separate account would be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by allstate would not change as discussed above contract owners will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the merger including the separate account transfer and will not by virtue of the merger have available any new or different investment options consequently contract owners will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the separate account transfer based on the foregoing we believe that section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the separate account transfer  separate account mergers in our view the separate account mergers would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act and rule  thereunder the separate account mergers would not result in any change to the northbrook va contracts except that allstate would succeed northbrook as depositor and as coissuer of the contracts the rights and benefits under the northbrook va contracts would remain the same all of the subaccounts of the northbrook va accounts would continue to invest in the same underlying funds the northbrook va contract values immediately following the merger will be the same as immediately before and contract owners would not be asked to make a new investment decision since their vote or consent is not required in connection with the merger the change in depositor following the merger does not change the nature of the securities outstanding the identity of the depositor is relevant to investors primarily because the depositor makes guarantees that are in the nature of insurance obligations for example the depositor in effect guarantees to make up any shortfall in separate account assets to pay any death benefit notwithstanding that the benefit might be greater than the amount of account value supporting the contract in question and to make annuity payments for whatever period is contractually required regardless of whether the relevant contracts account value has already been depleted thereby we respectfully submit therefore that the difference in depositors is a difference that relates almost exclusively to the insurance guarantees under the northbrook contracts rather than to those aspects of the contracts that constitute or cause the contracts to be securities this argues strongly against the conclusion that the existence of a different depositor necessarily gives rise to a different security moreover even if the separate account mergers were deemed to involve the issuance of new or different securities such issuance would not be registrable under the terms of section  or rule  because contract owners do not have any discretion about whether or not to participate in the separate account mergers accordingly the contract owners will not be called upon to make the kind of investment decision that historically has been deemed necessary for an offer or sale to occur that would bring section  into play nor in this case will there be the kind of security holder action that under the terms of the rule is required to bring rule  into play  fixed account transfer in our view the fixed account transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act no change will be made to the northbrook mva contracts by virtue of the fixed account transfer except that allstate will succeed northbrook as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the northbrook mva contracts these rights and benefits ie surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc will remain the same northbrook will transfer its nonunitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the northbrook mva contracts intact to allstate consequently when the fixed account transfer becomes effective allstate will hold these assets in the same nonunitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer as discussed above owners of northbrook mva contracts will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the fixed account transfer and will not by virtue of the fixed account transfer have available any new or different investment options consequently owners of northbrook mva contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the fixed account transfer b section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer in our view the succession of allstate to the position of depositor for the northbrook life separate account as a result of the merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to section  of the  act the merger will cause a change in the depositor of the northbrook life separate account which will involve a change in the coissuer of the units of interest under variable life insurance contracts funded through that separate account however the change in depositor will not change the structure or operation of the northbrook life separate account or its relationship to the insurance company issuing the northbrook vli contracts or to the contract owners the northbrook life separate account would continue to be treated as a separate entity for all relevant purposes including financial reporting the commissions ectoplasmic theory in our view supports the position that northbrook life separate account as such will have a continuing uninterrupted existence notwithstanding the change of the insurance company serving as its depositor and having legal ownership of its assets although the assets of northbrook life separate account will become assets of allstate such assets will remain intact in a legally separate account and for financial reporting purposes the separate account will be treated as a continuing separate entity accordingly to reflect the change in legal ownership of the assets of the northbrook life separate account from northbrook to allstate following the consummation of the merger allstate and the separate account will file a new registration statement on form n that will constitute an amendment to the separate accounts existing registration under the  act the form n registration statement also will register under the  act any securities transactions effected under the northbrook vli contracts after the merger allstate will file the form n registration statement to ensure that it will become effective on or about the effective date of the merger c section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer and the separate account mergers based on the foregoing analysis we also believe that the separate account transfer does not involve an exchange of securities the separate account interests in the northbrook vli contracts issued by an investment company the northbrook vli separate account for securities of any other investment company for purposes of section  of the  act in addition for the reasons discussed above we believe that the separate account mergers do not involve an offer of exchange within the meaning of section  however should the separate account transfer or the separate account mergers be viewed as including an offer of exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of section  we believe that such transactions would comply with the requirements of section a and rule ab thereunder because any such exchange would be effected at relative net asset values thus commission approval of such transactions should not be required under section  of the  act d continued reliance on prior exemptive relief is appropriate we believe the exemptions under the  act that northbrook the northbrook separate accounts and the other parties named therein have received from the commission or its staff should continue to apply after the merger to allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and other parties named therein to the extent they continue to be relied upon without the filing with the commission of amended or duplicative applications for the same relief their continued applicability is appropriate because the merger will not change the operations of allstate separate account i nor its relationship to its depositor any other separate account or contract owners the only changes resulting from the merger are i the substitution of allstate for northbrook as depositor for the northbrook separate accounts and as coissuer and insurer of the northbrook contracts ii the transfer of the subaccounts of the northbrook separate accounts to allstate separate account i iii the transfer of northbrook life separate account to allstate and iv the consolidation of the transferred subaccounts that invest in the same underlying funds it is our view that such changes have no impact upon and are not relevant to the exemptions that were previously granted or the justifications for those exemptions in support of our view we note that the commission staff has taken a favorable position on similar requests in several noaction letters iv noaction request based upon the above facts and circumstances we respectfully request that the commission staff issue a letter stating that it will not recommend that the commission take any enforcement action under section  of the  act and rule  thereunder in connection with the merger including the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer or under section  of the  act in connection with the separate account transfer and section  of the  act in connection with the separate account transfer and the separate account mergers in addition we request that the staff advise us that the exemptive orders cited herein to the extent they continue to be relied upon will continue to be applicable after the effective date in the manner described

consolidations and transfers of assets will be deemed to involve the offer or sale of securities requiring registration under the act under circumstances where existing security holders are in effect asked to make an investment decision whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for a security they presently own even if the merger were deemed to be a transfer of assets for purposes of rule  it is clear that the rule does not apply because the contract owners are not being asked to vote on or to consent to the transaction for these reasons we believe that rule  is inapplicable to

opportunities are as an allstate financial advisor  i have  years experience but assets and revenue not growing as i would like  independent right now  i know the payouts are lower but wondering what kind of revenue you can generate  yes i know you have to share with the insurance agents and that they are not always fond of financial advisorsi have searched the forums but not finding any recent information  thanks jun    pm i am legendjoined offline these are series  positions jun    am spaceman spiffjoined offline if you want the comfort of a bd why dont you try to get hired at jones or bacmer mssb or one of the regional firms  i have yet to talk to anyone who has any serious money with their insurance agent  except for my insurance agent who is slowly moving his assets to me  i think youd have better luck growing your assets with one of the big name firms than you would a pc company like allstate  jones loves producing transfer brokers btw  jun    am maybeeeeeeeejoined offline hah well surprise did not pass the pre screening employment with scenarios   pick which is best and which is worse funny  passed every other single test i have ever taken  guess i am not the insurance type  i always think of the insurance guy from ground hog day and cringe  need more help growing my business banks make me cringe  where i am now is fine just got to hit one of my big onesmoving on  beep beep alstate jun    am comptonplayajoined offline instead of trying to move you need to focus on why you are failing   of the time it is lack of effort come on get out there and

chronic production issues are behavioral issues want to change your production change your behavior and return to the appropriate levels of prospecting activity you are responsibleto quote on my ownlook in the mirror and you will find the answer to why you are not growing your business its not the firmi dont want to sound harsh however it is the truth all you need to do is sitdown with your clients and review their accounts i bet youll find additional assets that you did not know about to invest suitable reallocations and referrals it will work if you work it thats what i didi would say best of luck however if you do this luck will not be neededon my own jun    pm gaddockjoined offline before i went with age i was offered a gig with allstate where i would have had several local offices provide referrals to me their bonus or some such put pressure on them to do just that the title was an efs executive financial specialist the numbers the guys that were in the region were pretty huge   k it seemed like a candy gig but you had to use their proprietary funds for the most part im a stock and options kind of guy so i passed and went with age the requirements for the job were pretty stiff at least  years in financial products series    and you had to have made at least k in the previous year if thats what you are being offered you wont have to prospect the good part i guess the bad part is that its their business and clients its not portable at all by contract jun    pm remo gaggijoined offline i have come to realize that you can do this gig anywhere provided you have three tools at your disposal  first make sure you have a procedure that you can replicate  no sense in getting going and discover that the paperwork changes every three months  second make sure you have a business stye in mind  if you want wraps wrap  if you want a shares sell a shares  if you want etfs with  wraps and some action god help you but do that  nothing worse than changing and changing and changing  last  you need to work  if you are successful at this your light week is  hours you have about  households and you are getting bigger all the time otherwise you are just another poser who wants to be a broker and watched wall street too many times reply
