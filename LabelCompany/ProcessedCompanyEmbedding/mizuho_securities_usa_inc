receive compensation based upon various factors including quality of research investor client feedback stock picking competitive factors firm revenues and overall investment banking revenues research

a research analyst account ​d order handling and trading disclosures finra rule  – best execution in any equity transaction for a customer msusa will use reasonable care in seeking to obtain the most advantageous terms reasonably available under the circumstances for the execution of a customer’s order  in determining where to send customers’ orders msusa takes into consideration in among other things the size and type of order the terms and instructions of the order the trading characteristics of the security the character of the market for the security the accessibility of quotations transaction costs the opportunity for price or size improvement the speed of execution the availability of efficient and reliable order handling systems the level of service provided by the market venue and the customer’s overall objectives with respect to the market conditions at the time of the order msusa regularly reviews transactions for quality of execution order handling and capital commitment the msusa us equity trading desk “msusa us et” may maintain inventory of principal positions to provide our clients with opportunities for enhanced capital commitment to effectively manage these inventory positions and sustain immediate liquidity for our clients msusa us et may trade out of risk resulting from customer facilitation activity at the same time we may be handling your orders at the same price level  msusa us et will trade principally alongside a customer order to the extent that our principal activity either hedges or liquidates risk resulting from client facilitation  in certain instances principal orders entered in anticipation of future client demand may also be worked concurrently with customer orders regulation nms – order protection rule was adopted to strengthen the national market system for equity securities it requires markets to interact in a way that permits orders to seek the best available market  the order protection rule rule  is the primary rule that affects brokerdealers and requires brokerdealers to prevent “tradethroughs”  therefore msusa us et will be prohibited from effecting that transaction at a price that is lower higher than the best bids offers in the market without first satisfying those betterpriced protected quotations the regulation nms – order protection rule contains various exceptions that in certain situations permit the execution of trades at prices that would otherwise constitute a tradethrough  in instances where no other exceptions are available msusa us et will use an intermarket sweep order “iso” to sweep the market and execute any betterpriced protected quotations in any transaction where the firm commits capital you may choose to decline the executions resulting from the isos whether you choose to accept or decline the iso executions msusa us et is still required to satisfy those betterpriced quotations and the benefit of those executions will be factored into your negotiated price if you accept the iso executions your transaction price will reflect the receipt of those betterpriced executions and differ from the originallynegotiated price finra rule   trade along not held orders customer orders received by msusa are deemed “not held” orders unless you customer specifically request and provide other specific order instructions  a “not held” order means you are giving msusa time and price discretion in seeking to obtain the best execution of your order when handling “not held” limit orders for institutional customers msusa is generally not required by regulation to display or protect the limit order  msusa may trade for its own account at prices equal to or better than those of “not held” orders  however msusa is still obligated to provide best execution handling orders on a not held basis also means that msusa may on occasion simultaneously conduct sameside principal trading in the same or related products while your order is outstanding  principal trading while in possession of a customer order is allowed and may occur with knowledge of the customer order as prepositioning and anticipatory hedging for the overall benefit of the customer order in the first case of noknowledge msusa has established information barriers to restrict information about unexecuted orders from other trading areas not involved with the handling of the order either as an agent or as a solicited contraparty in the case of prepositioning or anticipatory hedging with knowledge and consideration of the customer order your order to msusa may be marked as tradealong  msusa holding a customer order are restricted from related trading except where prepositioning is designed to enhance the overall execution quality for the customer  efforts to enhance execution quality by related principal prepositioning can occur in varying circumstances  by way of example without limitation when a customer seeks a guarantee to be filled at the closing price it carries the expectation that msusa may engage in prepositioning activity in order to lessen the market impact of the block particularly on the closing price  prepositioning under these circumstances may diffuse the impact of a large block order by spreading out its execution effect over a period of time and perhaps over several different markets  another example would be in connection with the placement of a large etf order where the execution of an anticipatory hedge in one or more nonoption related products may serve to reduce facilitation risk and produce an overall benefit to the customer in the form of a superior execution  it should be noted however that exchange rules restrict the use of anticipatory hedges in the listed options market until after the customer’s order is publicly exposed or in the case of tied stock where both the option order and anticipatory hedge transactions are offered to the option trading crowd  if you choose to opt into the protections afforded by rule  please send notice to compliance department mizuho securities usa llc  park ave th floor new york ny  or by email to eqcomplianceusmizuhosccom execution alternatives and sourcing liquidity msusa us et utilizes vendor developed tools algorithm strategy designed to access external and internal sources of liquidity to obtain the most favorable execution of your orders reasonably available under market

systems “ats” that seek anonymous crossing opportunities please note that msusa does not operate an ats  msusa subscribes to various ats and may also access such destinations via another contracted broker dealer  orders worked through any of the automated execution strategies msusa accesses may receive automated capital provision in an attempt to improve overall execution quality  given the variety of means that msusa may employ to provide your orders with the best possible execution and absent specific instructions to the contrary your transactions may be executed on an agency agency

confirm equity transactions on a net basis  a net transaction is a principal transaction in which the market maker after having received an order to buy or sell an equity security buys or sells the security from or to another dealer or another customer and then sells to or buys from the customer at a different price  msusa is compensated in the form of a spread added tosubtracted from the cost

principal basis that is being or was established for the purpose of facilitating a client order  resulting transactions may be executed on a principal basis agency cross basis or a combination thereof  finra rule  – prohibition on front running client block transactions rule  the “rule” prohibits a brokerdealer from trading for its own account while in possession of information regarding an imminent client block transaction  msusa employees are strictly prohibited from engaging in such activity  rule  does contain certain exceptions to this general prohibition the rule does not preclude a brokerdealer from trading for its own account for purpose of fulfilling or facilitating the execution of a client’s block transaction consistent with this exception you should be aware that msusa may engage in trading to hedge the risk of your block transaction using market data and other forms of permissible information that are available to us this hedging activity may coincidentally impact the market prices of the securities or financial instruments you are buying or selling msusa will conduct this trading in a manner designed to limit market impact and consistent with our best execution obligations whether in the facilitation of block transactions or other services for which you engage msusa we will not place our financial interests ahead of your own extended trading hours finra rule  requires that msusa disclose to you the following potential risks if you engage in equities transactions during extended trading hours pm – am eastern standard time risk of lower liquidity liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities generally the more orders that are available in a market the greater the liquidity liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities and as a result investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold there may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular trading hours as a result your order may only be partially executed or not at all risk of higher volatility volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading generally the higher the volatility of a security the greater its price swings there may be greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular trading hours as a result your order may only be partially executed or not at all or you may receive an inferior price when engaging in extended hours trading than you would during regular trading hours risk of changing prices the prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either at the end of regular trading hours or upon the opening the next morning as a result you may receive an inferior price when engaging in extended hours trading than you would during regular trading hours risk of unlinked markets depending on the extended hours trading system or the time of day the prices displayed on a particular extended hours trading system may not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same securities accordingly you may receive an inferior price in one extended hours trading system than you would in another extended hours trading system risk of news announcements normally issuers make news announcements that may affect the price of their securities after regular trading hours similarly important financial information is frequently announced outside of regular trading hours in extended hours trading these announcements may occur during trading and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility may cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of a security risk of wider spreads the spread refers to the difference in price between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading may result in wider than normal spreads for a particular security ​e business continuity disclosure msusa has developed and implemented a business continuity plan “bcp” designed to address and mitigate the potential consequences of a significant business disruption our bcp is intended to permit the temporary continuation of the key parts of our business despite the occurrence of

commission v mizuho securities usa inc civ ra abrams j sdny filed july   mizuho to pay  million to settle sec charges of misleading investors in cdo the securities and exchange commission has charged the us investment banking subsidiary of japanbased mizuho financial group and three former employees with misleading investors in a collateralized debt obligation cdo by using “dummy assets” to inflate the deal’s credit ratings the sec also charged the firm that served as the deal’s collateral manager and the person who was its portfolio manager according to the sec’s complaint filed july  against mizuho securities usa inc the firm made approximately  million in structuring and marketing fees in the deal mizuho agreed to pay  million to settle the sec’s charges and the others charged also agreed to settle the sec’s actions against them the sec alleges that mizuho structured and marketed delphinus cdo  a cdo that was backed by subprime bonds at a time when the housing market was showing signs of severe distress the deal was contingent upon mizuho obtaining credit ratings it used to market the notes to investors when its employees realized that delphinus could not meet one rating agency’s newly announced criteria intended to protect cdo investors from the uncertainty of ratings downgrades they submitted to the rating firm a portfolio containing millions of dollars in dummy assets that inaccurately reflected the collateral held by delphinus once the firm rated the inaccurate portfolio mizuho closed the transaction and sold the notes to investors using the misleading ratings delphinus defaulted in  and eventually was liquidated in  mizuho sustained substantial losses from delphinus according to the sec’s settled administrative proceedings against the three former mizuho employees responsible for the delphinus deal alexander rekeda headed the group that structured the  billion cdo xavier capdepon modeled the transaction for the rating agencies and gwen snorteland was the transaction manager responsible for structuring and closing delphinus delaware asset advisers daa served as delphinus’s collateral manager and the daa portfolio manager was wei alex wei mizuho securities usa inc according to the sec’s complaint against mizuho filed in federal court in manhattan all of the collateral assets for delphinus had been purchased by july   and the transaction was scheduled to close on july  however around noon on july  standard  poor’s sp issued a press release announcing changes to its cdo rating criteria requiring certain categories of subprime residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs to be adjusted downward for purposes of calculating their default probability the mizuho employees knew that delphinus’s actual portfolio contained a substantial amount of rmbs that were subject to the downward ratings and that delphinus as constructed could not meet its rating targets under these tougher standards to enable delphinus to close anyway the mizuho employees emailed multiple alternative portfolios to sp that contained dummy assets that were superior in credit quality to the assets that had been actually acquired for the cdo once the necessary ratings were secured by the use of dummy assets the delphinus transaction closed by midafternoon on july  and securities were sold based upon these higher ratings investors were thus misled to believe that the delphinus notes had achieved the advertised ratings that the actual closing portfolio would not support according to the sec’s complaint in connection with delphinus’s subsequent request for a required rating confirmation from sp mizuho employees provided and arranged for others to provide further inaccurate information about the composition of delphinus’s assets primarily they misrepresented that delphinus’s effective date was august  rather than july  sp then provided delphinus with the ratings confirmation using the improper effective date of august  as a result of mizuho’s conduct the sec has alleged that mizuho violated sections a and  of the securities act of  without admitting or denying the allegations of the sec’s complaint mizuho agreed to settle by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins mizuho from violating those provisions of the securities act and requires mizuho to pay  million in disgorgement  million in prejudgment interest and a  million penalty for a total of  million the settlement is subject to court approval rekeda capdepon and snorteland in the related administrative proceedings against rekeda capdepon and snorteland the sec found that rekeda violated sections a and  of the securities act and capdepon and snorteland violated section a rekeda and capdepon each agreed to pay a  penalty while the decision on whether there will be a penalty for snorteland will be decided at a later date rekeda agreed to be suspended from the securities industry for  months capdepon and snorteland each agreed to be barred from the securities industry for one year and all three agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the respective sections of the securities act they violated delaware asset advisers and wei in related administrative proceedings against daa and wei the sec found that as a result of the roles they played in providing misleading information in august and september  daa violated sections a and  of the securities act and section  of the advisers act and wei violated section a and  of the securities act and caused daa’s violation of section  of the advisers act without admitting or denying the sec’s findings  daa consented to the entry of an order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of sections a and  of the securities act and section  of the advisers act and requiring it to pay disgorgement of  prejudgment interest of  and a civil money penalty of  and  wei consented to the entry of an order requiring him to cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of sections a and  of the securities act and section  of the advisers act suspending him from associating with any investment adviser for six months and requiring him to pay a civil money penalty of  the sec’s investigation into the delphinus transaction is continuing
