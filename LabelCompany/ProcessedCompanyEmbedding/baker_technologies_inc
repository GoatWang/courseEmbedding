today’s complex printed circuit boards incorporate varying sizes of high aspect ratio plated through holes micro vias and blind vias all on the same panel while these parts can be effectively plated with dc plating at very low current densities and with specially optimized dc chemistries the impact on factory capacity can be profound and economically impractical pulse plating is the solution to improved throughput better surfacetohole throwing power and highly reliable plating whether simple pulse plating or pulse periodic reverse plating pulse has demonstrated proven benefits in the printed circuit board and many metal finishing applications especially with precious metals • enhanced throwing power finer grain structure deposits improved    metal properties and product reliability • faster deposition speed and therefore higher line capacity however pulse plating alone is not a panacea answer to the plating challenges of today’sworld bta realizes the need to analyze and optimize

guaranteeing system results • plating tank design and construction • chemistry optimization and operation • pulse rectifier and waveform optimization experience has shown that for most simpler less difficult products that a conventional single frequency “square waveform” type pulse reverse plating system is an appropriate answer however for really challenging boards having very high aspect

platexpress™ dc power supplies pulse rectifiers why switchmode why pulse plating circuit boards single frequency ppr metal finishing multifrequency wst substantial research confirms that a single and unique pulse frequency is required to plate a particular hole diameter in a panel of a particular thickness with  throwing power since most if not all panels have multiple hole sizes andor various size blind vias it is necessary to have multiple frequencies of pulses to plate each feature size with  throwing power when using a single frequency pulse rectifier a “batch program is commonly used where the plating frequency is changed a number of times during the plating cycle with this approach a single frequency is used for some minutes and then changed to another frequency this method of batch programming is a way to “average” the plating on the board’s various features however once nonuniform plating has begun it cannot be corrected later in the plating process furthermore as the aspect ratios increase the single frequency on a conventional pulse rectifier must also increase to obtain  throwing power however for very high aspect ratios there is a point beyond which classic ppr waveforms alone are inadequate and do not achieve  throwing power to overcome the limitations of these single frequency pulse rectifiers bta developed its wave switching technology wst complex waveform multifrequency pulse rectifier which is specifically designed for advanced technology multifeatured high valueadded printed circuit boards • wst combines the benefits of both pulse and pulse reverse rectifiers    allowing users to program in “rests” within the forward andor reverse    pulses this drastically improves the throwing power on very high    aspect ratio applicatons • wst allows the user to run a multifrequency waveform with up to five     pulsepulse reverse waveforms each second • the wst multifrequency waveform eliminates the need for “batching”    cycles and the ongoing demand for process engineering assistance •  of all wst users require only  or  waveforms for all products    in their factory • wst eliminates the worries about cable inductance common with    singlefrequency square waveform ppr rectifiers and therefore    the need for costly coaxial cable • new and refurbished wst systems are available • wst makes pulse plating simple download data
