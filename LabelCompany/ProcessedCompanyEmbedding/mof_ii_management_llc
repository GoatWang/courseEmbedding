type of investment presented by the coinvestment opportunity    reasons for coinvesting   it is anticipated that coinvestment in portfolio companies by the regulated entities and the affiliated funds should increase the number of favorable investment opportunities for the regulated entities the coinvestment program will be implemented if it is approved by a required majority as defined below of the applicable regulated entity   the regulated entity advisers expect that coinvestment by the regulated entities and the affiliated funds or among the regulated entities themselves will provide the regulated entities with the ability to achieve greater diversification and together with the affiliated funds the opportunity to exercise greater influence on the portfolio companies in which the regulated entities and the participating funds coinvest   a bdc that makes investments of the type contemplated by the regulated entities typically limits its participation in any one transaction to a specific dollar amount which may be determined by legal or internally imposed limits on exposure in a single investment in addition the code imposes diversification requirements on companies such as the regulated entities which seek certain favorable tax treatment under subchapter m of the code   in view of the foregoing in cases when a regulated entity adviser identifies investment opportunities requiring larger capital commitments it must seek the participation of other entities with similar investment styles the availability of the affiliated funds andor other regulated entities as investing partners of a regulated entity may alleviate the necessity in certain circumstances   without the opportunity for coinvestment each regulated entity acting alone might have to forego some investment opportunities if the respective regulated entity cannot provide all of the financing required by a potential portfolio company portfolio companies may reject an offer of funding arranged by a regulated entity adviser as a result of the regulated entity’s inability to commit the entire amount of financing required by the portfolio company in a timely manner by reducing the number of instances in which a regulated entity’s individual or aggregate investment limits require the regulated entity adviser to arrange a syndicated financing with unaffiliated entities the regulated entities likely will be required to forego fewer attractive investment opportunities with the assets of the affiliated funds along with the assets of the other regulated entities available for coinvestment there should be an increase in the number of opportunities accessible to each regulated entity      see irc section b          the regulated entity advisers and the board of each of the regulated entities believe that it would be desirable for the regulated entities to coinvest with other regulated entities and with the affiliated funds and that such investments would be consistent with the investment objective investment policies investment positions investment strategies investment restrictions regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors applicable to the regulated entities   at least quarterly the board of each of the regulated entities will review the rationale for the coinvestment program and evaluate whether the program remains important to the regulated entities    mechanics of the coinvestment program   in selecting investments for each regulated entity the regulated entity advisers will consider the investment objective investment policies investment position capital available for investment and other factors relevant to the respective regulated entities they advise similarly in selecting investments for the affiliated funds the affiliated investment adviser will choose investments separately for each entity considering in each case the investment objective investment policies investment position capital available for investment and other factors relevant to that particular investing entity the regulated entity advisers expect that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a regulated entity should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other regulated entities andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification the regulated entities however will not be obligated to invest or coinvest when investment opportunities are referred to them   the regulated entity adviser as applicable will present each proposed coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation of each investment opportunity to the directors of the relevant regulated entity’s board that are eligible to vote under section o the “ eligible directors ” the “required majority” as defined in section o “ required majority ” of a regulated entity will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the regulated entity no independent director will have any direct or indirect financial interest in any coinvestment transaction or any interest in any portfolio company other than through an interest if any in the securities of the regulated entity   all subsequent activity ie exits or followon investments in a coinvestment transaction will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this application          a regulated entity may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated entity and affiliated fund is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of directors of the regulated entity has approved that regulated entity’s participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated entity if the board has not given such approval in advance any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated entity’s eligible directors the board of a regulated entity may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors   the coinvestment program stipulates that the terms conditions price class of securities settlement date and registration rights applicable to the applicable regulated entity’s purchase be the same as those applicable to the purchase by the other regulated entities andor participating funds   the amount of each regulated entity’s capital available for investment will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand existing commitments and reserves if any the targeted leverage level targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set from time to time by the board of the applicable regulated entity or imposed by applicable laws rules regulations or interpretations likewise an affiliated fund’s capital available for investment is determined based on the amount of cash on hand existing commitments and reserves if any the targeted leverage level targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set by the affiliated fund’s directors general partners or adviser or imposed by applicable laws rules regulations or interpretations   b applicable law    sections d a and i and rule d   section d of the  act generally prohibits an affiliated person as

section a rule d as made applicable to bdcs by section i prohibits any person who is related to a bdc in a manner described in section b as modified by rule b acting as principal from participating in

prohibited person acting as principal to participate in or effect a transaction in connection with a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profitsharing plan in which a bdc is a participant if an application regarding the joint enterprise arrangement or profitsharing plan has been filed with the commission and has been granted by an order issued prior to the submission of such plan or any modification thereof to security holders for approval or prior to its adoption or modification if not so submitted paragraph b of rule d states that in passing upon applications under that rule the commission will consider whether the participation by the investment company in such joint enterprise joint arrangement or profitsharing plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants   applicants submit that the fact that the required majority of each regulated entity will approve each coinvestment transaction before the investment is made and other protective conditions set forth in this application will ensure that the regulated entities will be treated fairly each regulated entity would have the ability to engage in followon investments in a fair manner consistent with the protections of the other conditions   if the regulated entity advisers or the principals or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the regulated entity advisers or the principals and the affiliated funds collectively the “ holders ” own in the aggregate more than  percent of the outstanding voting shares of a regulated entity the “ shares ” then the holders will vote such shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on  the election of directors  the removal of one or more directors or  any other matter under either the act or applicable state law affecting the board’s composition size or manner of election   applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the independent directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of the regulated entity advisers or the principals to influence the independent directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the independent directors can be removed will be limited significantly the independent directors shall evaluate and approve any independent third party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant          the conditions to which the requested relief will be subject are designed to ensure that the regulated entity advisers the affiliated investment advisers or the principals would not be able to favor the affiliated funds over the regulated entities or one regulated entity over another through the allocation of investment opportunities among them  to the extent there is an investment that falls within the objectives and strategies of a regulated entity and one or more other regulated entities andor the investment objectives and strategies of one or more affiliated funds it is expected that a regulated entity will coinvest with one or more other regulated entities andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification the regulated entities however will not be obligated to invest or coinvest when investment opportunities are referred to them applicants submit that the coinvestment program presents an attractive alternative to the institution of some form of equitable allocation protocol for the allocation of  of individual investment opportunities to either one regulated entity or the affiliated funds as opportunities arise   applicants submit that the regulated entities’ participation in the coinvestment transactions will be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants applicants believe that the conditions will ensure that the regulated entity advisers the affiliated investment advisers and the principals would not be able to favor the affiliated funds over the regulated entities or one regulated entity over another through the allocation of investment opportunities among them because as a guiding principle the conditions permit a coinvestment transaction only if the eligible directors have made a determination that the proposed investment would not benefit an affiliated person other than the fund participating in the transaction and then only to the extent strictly permitted by the conditions   after making the determinations required in conditions  and a other than in the case of pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided for in conditions  and  the applicable regulated entity adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the eligible directors and the required majority will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the regulated entity   applicants believe that participation by the regulated entities in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and will not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants a formulaic approach such as pro rata dispositions and followon investments eliminates the discretionary ability to make allocation determinations and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness    g conditions   applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions    each time a regulated entity adviser or an affiliated investment adviser considers a potential coinvestment transaction for an affiliated fund or another regulated entity that falls within the thencurrent objectives and strategies of a regulated entity   the appropriate regulated entity adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the regulated entity in light of the regulated entity’s thencurrent circumstances    a if a regulated entity adviser deems a regulated entity’s participation in any potential coinvestment transaction to be appropriate for such regulated entity it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for such regulated entity   b if the aggregate amount recommended by regulated entity advisers to be invested by the regulated entities in such potential coinvestment transaction together with the amount proposed to be invested by each participating fund collectively in the same transaction exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity the amount proposed to be invested by each such party will be

entity advisers will provide the respective eligible directors with information concerning each party’s available capital to assist the eligible directors with their review of such regulated entity’s investments for compliance with these allocation procedures      “ objectives and strategies ” means the regulated entity’s investment objectives and strategies as described in the regulated entity’s

and do not involve overreaching in respect of the regulated entity or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned    ii the transaction is consistent with   a the interests of the regulated entity’s stockholders and   b the regulated entity’s thencurrent objectives and strategies   iii the investment by another regulated entity or one or more participating funds would not disadvantage

any participating fund or other regulated entity but not the regulated entity itself gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company’s board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the required majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition ciii if   a the eligible directors shall have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer if any   b the regulated entity adviser agrees to and does provide periodic reports to the board of the applicable regulated entity with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained

participating fund or any affiliated person of either receives in connection with the right of a participating fund or other regulated entity to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among any participating funds who may in turn share their portion with their affiliated persons and the participating regulated entities in accordance with the amount of each party’s investment and          iv the proposed investment by the regulated entity will not benefit the regulated entity advisers the affiliated funds or other regulated entities or any affiliated person of any of them other than the other parties to the coinvestment transaction except a to the extent permitted
