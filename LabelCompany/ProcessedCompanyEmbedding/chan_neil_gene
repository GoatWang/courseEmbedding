an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the neil gene neil belongs to a class of dna glycosylases homologous to the bacterial fpgnei family these glycosylases initiate the first step in base excision repair by cleaving bases damaged by reactive oxygen species ros and introducing a dna strand break via the associated lyase reaction contents  targets  deficiency in cancer  references  further reading targetsedit neil recognizes targets and removes certain rosdamaged bases and then incises the abasic site via βδ elimination leaving ′ and ′ phosphate ends neil recognizes oxidized pyrimidines formamidopyrimidines thymine residues oxidized at the methyl group and both stereoisomers of thymine glycol the best substrates for human neil appear to be the hydantoin lesions guanidinohydantoin and spiroiminodihydantoin that are further oxidation products of oxog neil is also capable of removing lesions from singlestranded dna as well as from bubble and forked dna structures because the expression of neil is cellcycle dependent and because it acts on forked dna structures and interacts with pcna and fen it has been proposed that neil functions in replication associated dna repair deficiency in canceredit neil is one of the dna repair genes most frequently hypermethylated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc when  human dna repair genes were evaluated for aberrant methylation in hnscc tumors  of tumors were hypermethylated in the neil promoter region causing neil messenger rna and neil protein to be repressed when  dna repair genes were evaluated in nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc tumors  were hypermethylated in the neil promoter region this was the most frequent dna repair deficiency found among the  dna repair genes tested neil was also one of six dna repair genes found to be hypermethylated in their promoter regions in colorectal cancer while other dna repair genes such as mgmt and mlh are often evaluated for epigenetic repression in many types of cancer epigenetic deficiency of neil is usually not evaluated but might be of importance in such cancers as well dna damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer if dna repair is deficient dna damage tends to accumulate such excess dna damage may increase mutational errors during dna replication due to errorprone translesion synthesis excess dna damage may also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during dna repair such mutations and epigenetic alterations may give rise to cancer see malignant neoplasms in colon cancer germ line mutations in dna repair genes cause only – of cases however methylation of the promoter region of dna repair genes including neil are frequently associated with colon cancers and may be an important causal factor for these cancers
