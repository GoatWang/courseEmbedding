thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in top underwriters how to engage with investors in the age of the activist investorsâ access to boardÂ leaders posted on may    leave a comment this is part twoÂ of a series read part one the ascent of activist investors and the need to adapt to boardtoinvestor communications are producing drastic changes in the way companies interact with their shareholders question  institutional investors are demanding more process and access to board leaders traditionally companies have avoided this at all costs is that still an appropriate strategy lex suvanto  companies are actively thinking about how best to leverage their directors as part of their shareholder communications strategy traditionally board members and companies have been averse to doing this at all there have always been exceptions such as when ceo succession or leadership compensation were in question but now companies in all industries are thinking about putting board members into the mix to strengthen relationships with investors i have heard and seen how a successful meeting between a director and an important investor can be very effective in terms of reinforcing a companyâs strategy future prospects and the views of management i would even say that itâs becoming a best practice to leverage directors in very targeted ways as part of an effort to articulate longterm strategy at the same time this practice brings with it certain challenges for example which board member are you going to put in front of investors how prepared are they what are they going to talk about and how is it different from what the ceo cfo and investor relations head are talking about you also have to decide which investors the directors are most relevant and helpful for jason m halper  there are at least a couple of issues to keep in mind when companies are considering how best to approach board engagement if youâre talking about the us and a public company you need to be careful about disclosing material nonpublic information in the course of those communications because of sec regulation fair disclosure rules whoever is doing the engagement needs to have a very clear sense of which information is and is not permissible to disclose if youâre going to disclose nonpublic information you need a confidentiality agreement from the shareholder as for outside directors they are not going to be as familiar with the daytoday activities of the company so you would generally want to limit them to areas theyâre familiar with â things like corporate governance executive compensation perhaps high level strategy chris ruggieri  if you go back  years we would routinely refer to institutional investors as âpassiveâ the reality today is that there is no such thing as a passive investor it has always been important for companies to be engaged with their owners and to stimulate interest and demand and weâre seeing more of that the advice i give our clients is that it is imperative for you to have a constructive relationship with your investors you should have a regular calendar of interactions with them and you should be listening closely to gather their input you should be trying to find out if there are any misperceptions about the company or its stock to understand if there is any misalignment in terms of expectations and to get a general sense of their sentiment about how youâre running the company and their level of satisfaction i think the one area where debate continues is when it comes to who is responsible for interacting with shareholders what weâre hearing from investors is that they want more direct access to csuite executives and some investors are asserting that the board should play a role in shareholder engagement even though thatâs not a routine board responsibility increasingly weâve seen letters from vanguard and other large institutions regarding expectations of board engagement and board participation i think weâre going to continue to have that discussion until we find a point of equilibrium where investors are satisfied with the level of board interaction and companies and board directors feel comfortable and confident that itâs the right balance Â  Â  Â  share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in investor relations the ins and outs of preparing for an ipo phase twoÂ b posted on may    leave a comment this is the fifthÂ in a series of postsÂ the ins and outs of preparing for an ipo what your company needs to knowÂ  phase ii â executing an ipo Â  corporate governance and a board of directors all of the major stock exchanges require a registrant to have a majority of independent directors on its board according to pwc ââ¦one of the best sources of objective advice can come from an independent or outside directorâ as with every other element of the ipo journey a company should seek qualified board members well in advance of the ipo launch âa potential board member who is unfamiliar with a company may be reluctant to join the board immediately before an ipo since a director has personal liability for information contained in or omitted from the registration statementâ pwc adds eyâs guide to going public survey revealed that recruiting qualified independent board members was the greatest corporate governance issue faced during the ipo process choosing an investment bank of all the external advisory professionals involved in an ipo the underwriter is potentially the most important while no company is obligated to use an underwriter to go to market garnering their expertise has its advantages an investment bank can ensure an ipo will be properly managed and successfully marketed investment banks also have an instinct for timing an issue and they can often anticipate pitfalls and calculate risks the size and scope of a company and its offering will in part determine the size of the underwriter it will need to enlist for its ipo for more on the ipo process listen to the complete webinar here other characteristics to look for when choosing investment bankers include the candidateâs likeability communication style and trustworthiness it is also important to find an investment banker that specializes in businesses or industry segments similar to that of the ipo candidate and one that has proven experience in underwriting ipos regulatory compliance the financial healthcheck according to kpmg the process of going public will necessitate a fundamental shift in financial reporting and planning ipo candidates will need to comply with the local regulatory requirements for their respective exchange in the us this means compliance with both the federal sarbanesâoxley act and local us gaap accounting practices sarbanesoxley requires a registrantâs management ceo and cfo to provide certifications in periodic filings with the sec and to have an independent audit committee with at least one member qualified as a financial expert any public company will need a suite of boardapproved risk management and control policies companies in todayâs business environment are focusing more on risk assessment and response as a result of increased regulatory and investor scrutiny shareholders are also increasingly expecting transparency open communication and effective global risk management enhancing internal controls can help meet evolving tax legal accounting and procedural challenges establishing an internal audit committee is key to meeting these requirements audit committees typically examine the annual and quarterly financial reports and review the financial reporting and budgeting processes Â  share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin

how to engage with investors in the age of the activist introduction andÂ trends posted on may     comment management teams are facing a formidable new challenge in the growing ranks of activist investors expectations for shareholder dialogue have also risen how can companies meet these new demands activist investors have officially reached rockstar status carl icahn whose tactics strike fear into csuite executives worldwide has  twitter followers the pronouncements of bill ackman head of activist fund pershing square are chronicled almost daily by the press indeed the likes of icahn and ackman are in the lead of a growing movement veteran activists such as them are increasingly being joined by firsttimers in   campaigns were waged by new activists according to the wall street journal representing a  increase from a year earlier activists can bring innovation and discipline yet companies are often caught offguard by their approach leading to major disruptions in their strategic plans in order to prepare adequately firms must assume that an activist could enter the picture at any time learning the newÂ language ofÂ shareholdersÂ  preparation means being proactive with communication efforts and constantly engaging in dialogue with investors both current and prospective individual and institutioned to this end improvements in technology have allowed companies to reach stakeholders faster and with greater ease speeding up the process Â  as these trends take shapeÂ weâve interviewedÂ five experts to discuss how shareholder communications practices are changing these experienced professionals give insights into how to respond to activist campaigns how best to grant access to board members and what to keep in mind as companies prepare for a new rule regarding ceo compensation the ascent of activist investors and the need to adapt to boardtoinvestor communications are producing drastic changes in the way companies interact with their shareholders question  what trends legal or otherwise are you noting that have affected shareholder communications kai haakon e liekefett  the overall trend which has been going on for many years is shareholder activism this is clearly having an effect on the way companies go about shareholder communications probably forever about  years ago companies and boards were not very focused on shareholder communications â it was more a boardcentric world but the entire system in the us has changed to a more shareholdercentric world one especially noteworthy development is a change in companiesâ governance structures most companies used to have a corporate secretary in charge of corporate governance and then they had the investor relations ir officer in the past they did not work together very much but this has been changing dramatically for the last couple of years there is a widespread realization in particular at largecap companies that the corporate secretary and ir officer need to work handinhand because when youâre dealing primarily with large institutional investors as your shareholder base and they are all focused on corporate governance you need to make sure that the left hand understands what the right hand is doing lex suvanto  i think the most serious trend happening now is what i would call the âuberizationâ of industry there are many industries undergoing profound change â digital industries first and foremost but also the automobile industry the media industry and just about any other industry that is being upended by significant innovation their business models are being called into question as new entrants create a different future for a sector that is putting significant pressure on industry incumbents to talk about their strategy and about how theyâre going to continue to grow despite the ubers of the world coming in and paving new ground for themselves a related trend to consider is the drive by companies to cultivate more longterm shareholders the focus is turning away from shortterm shareholders and companies are contemplating how to talk more about longterm strategy â longer than just one or two years this raises questions about whether companies should provide guidance especially longterm guidance which is often difficult given the lack of visibility into the distant future and a third trend is the impact of macroeconomic volatility on the way companies communicate with their investors in january when we had pretty severe market volatility it caused companies to emphasize the resilience of their models and to think again about the debt side of the business rather than just the equity story the markets have leveled off somewhat since january but we saw how macroeconomic concerns can drive the content of shareholder communications john viglotti  one notable trend has to do with the proxy â companies are spending more effort and more money to create engaging materials around their proxy oftentimes the proxy will include color graphs and charts because companies want to emphasize certain proxy issues with investments by contrast many companiesâ annual reports now have zero color â itâs all justÂ blackandwhite text with doddfrank and other sec regulations there is also more and more information required to be included in the proxy especially in terms of executive compensation and analysis at the same time every company takes an individual approach to its communications strategy there are a lot of companies that are âjust compliantâ â they follow the letter of the law in terms of how they communicate with shareholders and not really telling the story of the company where theyâre going or why you should be investing in them in contrast there are other companies that are focused not just on communicating with current shareholders but also on attracting prospective investors they are interested in telling a story a vision and theyâre more frequent communicators so instead of just sending a press release every quarter around their earnings they may be sending  press releases chris ruggieri  over the last several years there has been a fundamental change in the relationship between public companies and their owners one aspect of that change is related to regulations and governance the dodd frank lawâs âsay on payâ rule for instance is a regulatory change that has emboldened investors to speak their minds directly about executive compensation weâve also seen an increase in proxy access â this issue is being hotly debated in the industry another key area is the emergence of new asset classes most notably activist hedge funds up through  activist hedge funds were one of the bestperforming asset classes and activists have been very bold in making assertions about how companies should be managed and how capital should be deployed the rise of activism was driven in part by the financial crisis which made investors seek more direct engagement with the companies in which theyâre invested the last key area i would mention is the information technology revolution the advent of the internet and mobile technology has made it easier than ever for investors to communicate with one another asÂ a consequence companies have lost some degree of control over the dissemination of information the velocity and transparency of information have never been higher jason m halper  on the investment side i think weâre seeing an acceleration of trends that have been around for a couple of years now those include an increase in assets under management of activist hedge funds an increase in the success rates of activists depending on how you define success and a shortening of the time periods from when an activist comes on the scene until the end of a campaign on the corporate side youâre seeing more firms adopting formal protocols for shareholder engagement when it comes to director engagement these protocols could address what permissible topics are the process by which a shareholder can request dialogue steps for preparing a director to engage in dialogue and particularly specifying which directors are tasked with engaging in that dialogue youâre also seeing increased engagement by institutional shareholders who represent the third leg of that stool if you will they are much more active and vocal about things such as corporate governance and executive compensation and much more willing to engage with both activists and companies share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin  comment posted in investor relations video
