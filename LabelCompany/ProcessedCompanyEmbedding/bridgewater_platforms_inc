priority or importance since the company does not intend to pay any offering expenses from the proceeds from this offering and assuming that       or   of the offering is sold the gross aggregate proceeds will be allocated as follows expenditure item         professional fees         websites     advertising  marketing     production equipment     working capital     total         there is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this offering and any funds received will be immediately available to us the above expenditures are defined as follows professional fees pertains to legal

would provide sufficient capital to commence and finish development of our new websites but we would only be able to spend  on advertising and marketing and only  on production equipment under this scenario we estimate that we would be able to continue to generate enough revenues to sustain our business should we be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business we will have to find other sources of financing if only  of the offering is sold we would still incur expected professional legal and accounting fees of  which will have to be paid to maintain reporting status during

to advertising and marketing or production equipment this would seriously hinder the development of our business and our ability to grow our revenues if we do not raise or generate through revenues sufficient funds to cover professional fees estimated to be  for the next  months we would not be able to remain reporting with the sec and therefore we would not be able to obtain an otcbb quotation

marketing resources than do we there are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful  there is a number of different landscape design and construction and pool

bridgewater platforms plans to enter the marketplace with a solution that provides a higher degree of safety and at the same time enables the previously unusable space to be walkedon for social

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives with the participation of our chief executive and financial officer our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july   based on the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework based upon such evaluation our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of july   based on the coso framework criteria as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses   the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee  lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and  management dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating controls the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive and financial officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of july     management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods   this annual report on form k does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding

for the year ended july   decreased by  from  for the year ended july   the decrease in expenses can be attributed to decreased professional fees and general and administrative expenses liquidity and financial condition currently we do not have sufficient funds to develop our business over the next  months working capital at july   we had a working capital deficit of  compared to working capital of  at july   the decrease in working capital can be primarily attributed to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities cash flows cash flow from operating activities during the year ended july   our company used  in cash from operating activities compared to the use of  of cash for operating activities during the year ended july   the

table of contents we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as at july   and  we have no known demands or commitments and we are not aware of any events or uncertainties as at july   that will result in or that is reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity going concern our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay for our expenses this is because we have generated limited revenues and have limited operating history there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing through either private placements andor bank financing or other loans necessary to support our working capital requirements to the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements public offerings andor bank financing are insufficient we will have to raise additional working capital no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or if available will be on terms acceptable to us limited operating history need for additional capital there is no historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance we have generated nominal revenues from operations we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources possible delays in developing our website and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services at present we do not have enough cash on hand to cover operating costs for the next  months if we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either our operations or possible alternative sources then we may be unable to continue develop or expand our operations critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported within those financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition contingencies litigation and income taxes management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results under circumstances and conditions different than those assumed could result in differences from the estimated amounts in the financial statements there have been no material changes to these policies during fiscal  offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet
