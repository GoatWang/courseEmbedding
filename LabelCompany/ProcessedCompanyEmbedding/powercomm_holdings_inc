to assist in understanding the companys unaudited financial statements such unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited financial statements certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations the results for the three months ended june  are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december   use of estimates the preparation of unaudited financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates cash cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less the company did not have cash equivalents as of june   concentration of risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality banking institutions the company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of june    powercomm holdings notes to unaudited financial statements income taxes under asc  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of june   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration loss per common share basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock was exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of june   there are no outstanding dilutive securities fair value of financial instruments the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments note   going concern the company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained an operating loss of  from january   to june   the company had a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  as of june   the companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations andor obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources as may be required  powercomm holdings inc notes to unaudited financial statements the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above condition raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to do so the unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern in order to maintain its current level of operations the company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity however the company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity if the company is unable to acquire additional working capital it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations note

financial statements      nature of operations   powercomm construction inc the “company” was incorporated in massachusetts in  and has been headquartered in alexandria virginia since  on september   the company changed its state of incorporation to virginia the company performs underground and overhead utility services primarily in the southeastern region of the united states working solely with utility companies the company’s fiscal year ends on december       summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules of the securities and exchange commission “sec” and in accordance with the us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap”   use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ materially from those results the most significant estimates reflected in the financial statements include depreciation and useful lives of property and equipment estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less   accounts receivable   accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value consisting of the carrying amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts as needed management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts customer concentrations customer credit worthiness current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves based on the management’s assessment no allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded at the balance sheet dates   fixed assets   fixed assets consist of computers furniture and fixtures machinery and equipment and trucks and vehicles they are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred additions renewals and betterments are capitalized when property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations   f       powercomm construction inc notes to unaudited financial statements   depreciation is computed primarily using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows     useful life in years     computers  office furniture and fixtures  machinery and equipment  trucks and vehicles    the company applies the provisions of fasb asc topic  asc  “property plant and equipment” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets to be held and used in accordance with asc  at least on an annual basis asc  requires the impairment losses to be recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the longlived assets loss on longlived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner except that fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal for the six months ended june   and the year ended december   there was no impairment of longlived assets recorded   revenue recognition   the company performs underground and overhead utility services primarily in the southeastern region of the united states for utility companies the company’s work is performed under costplusfee contracts the length of the company’s contracts varies but are typically two to three years revenues are recognized on the accrual basis as services are performed the company recognizes service revenue in accordance with gaap when the following overall fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or the service has been performed iii the company’s price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured during the six months ended june   and the year ended december   the company recognized revenue when the above four criteria were met   cost of revenue   costs of revenue include all direct materials labor costs equipment and those indirect costs including depreciation of machinery and equipment trucks and vehicles and indirect labor supplies tools repairs and miscellaneous job costs changes in job performance job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined   recent accounting pronouncements   in february   fasb issued asuleasesthe amendments in this update create topic  leases and supersede the leases requirements in topic  leases the objective of topic  is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease the fasb is issuing this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements topic  affects any entity that enters into a lease as that term is defined in this update with some specified scope exemptions the guidance in this update supersedes topic  leases the main difference between previous gaap and topic  is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous gaap the core principle of topic  is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases all leases create an asset and a liability for the lessee in accordance with fasb concepts statement no  elements of financial statements and therefore recognition of those lease assets and lease liabilities represents an improvement over previous gaap which did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments the lease liability and a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term when measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease a lessee and a lessor should include payments to be made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease similarly optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be included in the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that purchase option reasonably certain is a high threshold that is consistent with and intended to be applied in the same way as the reasonably assured threshold in the previous leases guidance in addition also consistent with the previous leases guidance a lessee and a lessor should exclude most variable lease payments in measuring lease assets and lease liabilities other than those that depend on an index or a rate or are in substance fixed payments for leases with a term of  months or less a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities if a lessee makes this election it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straightline basis over the lease term the amendments
