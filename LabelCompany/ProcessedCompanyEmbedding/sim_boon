screen that contrasts perfectly against the raw offform concrete structure of this modernist home in tropical singapore recently completed the house stands elevated on a hillside neighbourhood of singlestorey houses on the fringe of macritchie forest reserve save this picture  sim boon yang the screen comprises two layers of mature hollow bamboo sections specially ordered from a javanese bamboo forest each section of mm in diameter were cut to length cleaned and left in its natural finish suspended with a wire clip to a hanging bar the bamboo sways in the slightest breeze and gently collides much like a giant wind chime making the house both visually and aurally responsive to the weather they can be hand adjusted to create a selected view or a privacy screen the sound of the bamboo curtain varies through the day a low timbre registers of the passage of the prevailing morning and evening breezes save this picture  sim boon yang in practical terms the bamboo curtain is a perfect climactic screen that effectively dispels the heat of singapore’s tropical sun from penetrating the house during heavy rainstorms common during the monsoon season the screen also reduces horizontal driving rain the increasing din of the colliding bamboo curtain reminds its occupants to the on set of a rainstorm and hence to close doors and windows save this picture  sim boon yang the bamboo curtain house is owned and designed by sim boon yang of the awardwinning ecoid architects based in singapore following a minimalist principle of rational simplicity he designed the house as a box organised into four equal bays that accommodated the lifestyle of his family of five save this picture  sim boon yang an attempt to build the house with the least number of processes meant a recurring palette of natural unfinished bamboo the off form concrete walls and ceilings black granite and smoked oak floors a deliberate juxtaposition of roughhewn masculinity with warm and refined finishes save this picture  sim boon yang environmental consideration also figures in the design of the house in addition to the bamboo screens and skylights the roof pavilion is installed with a solar hot water system and incorporates a rain water collection system that channels rainfall into an underground cistern because of the tropical monsoon rains that fall over singapore a substantial volume of water can be collected for the usage of the house the roof over the master bedroom suite is sowed with a wild grass lawn that insulates it from solar gains descriptive walkthrough save this
