their hard work and customer focus in a great q and a great start to  as i mentioned in our last report we’re seeing a record new customer environments enabled in our sales performance configure price quote and mobile learning class in particular i wanted to point that out again because a key aspect of our success is our team’s ability to scale and i want to specifically highlight the commitment of world class people that we have in our customer support organization and in our saas operations group great job everyone now turning to review q and our outlook we have record revenues record saas revenues and collected a record level of cash in q thanks again to our finance team our services business performed ahead of plant due to momentum and cloud implementations great job by all in professional services our cloud revenue growth accelerated from  in q to  in q yearoveryear we signed several high ph six figure deals we signed over  new customers we have new and cross sell momentum across industries including telco hightech insurance in retail this was especially important since most of our conversion activity was completed last year as we expected yet our bookings were strong in q it is clear with a powerful portfolio of cloud sales enablement sales performance marketing and learning solutions that our sales team is very excited indeed and i believe prefers to attack new business and cross sell opportunities our sales teams new business appetite was reflected in notable customer signings in q including samsung for commissions – lite for commissions and producer pro allscripts healthcare for commissions and my sales game sirius computer solutions for commissions republic services for configure price quote and rockwell for configure price quote i’m also very excited about our learning business litmos team continues to sign more enterprise customers and this quarter added ibm ca boliva matchcom and once the largest network marketing clothing companies in the world our customer experience division signed some great brands including ge capital expedia and sony an existing click tools customer for our new service motivate solution launched in february to drive agent performance this was just the selection of our new deal activity in the quarter momentum continued from q into the first quarter and our activity levels were high i visited customers and prospects in six countries in the quarter and my travel commitments will increase as we introduce our new product roadmap across the world to our global customer base i attribute this continued momentum to many factors importantly though our suite and multiproduct capability on the fact that we can serve small medium and large customers across industries is central to our progress ourselves belongs to management business earned a strong leadership position again in the annual gartner magic quadrant this is the fourth consecutive report in the leaders quadrant and once again we are positioned high as for ability to execute and furthest for completeness of vision in the quadrant meanwhile our configure price quote solution was named in the top three during forrester wave review of the cpq market we never had so many solutions placed and leadership positions at the same time a great selling environment in my opinion this year sales performance management magic quadrant is especially significant not just because of calliduscloud’s leadership position but because of the market view on analytic in fact gartner believes that by   organizations will optimize the design and maintenance of their sales compensation – regimes through the use of advanced analytics solutions delivered by their sales performance management provider it is my view that the robust capabilities of thunderbridge place us in a perfect position to capitalize on what we are calling the rise of the sales performance analyst as a key role for companies with significant sales organizations our channel performed well in the quarter we saw strong deal activity and our partnerships which i’m pleased with i believe our engagement with all partners has never been better i personally spent quality time with key executives from sap and salesforce amongst others during q and spent several days in fact at sap involved or educating executives and sales teams on our sales performance and sales execution propositions just yesterday you may have seen salesforce highlighted our lead partnership and their excitement around a combined crm and commission’s proposition and our joint industry initiatives and i refer you to slide  of investor relations deck that roxanne mentioned highlighting some key partner announcements additionally our marketing activities were aligned to industry and partner activity in q and we see more of the same in q in q we attended sales forces world tour events in holland in germany and a number of events with industry analysts including the sales management association and smart selling tools litmos also was very busy sponsoring over half a dozen events in the quarter around the world including the association for talent development and person by the lloyd’s industryleading hr learning in cowen conference in may we will attend our first sap sapphire user conference where  attendees are expected we also have a best plan with forrester and sirius decisions later on in the year we will be at hp discover in july we sponsor a spot light on sales compensation industry’s biggest sales compensation event and of course play host to when – i expect will be our biggest and best c user conference in september  to  back at the fabulous wynn in las vegas our c investor day will be september  our new datahug acquisition is building a good pipeline and our customer experience business is doing the same our litmos mobile learning business is continuing as high growth trajectory and was regionally featured in leadership positions for enterprise learning technology and reduced by both gartner and g crowd the international business climate remains positive despite recent political changes after assessing the effects of brexit we decided to move to a superior office space in central london with great customer facing facilities and room for growth we are on track to open our disaster recovery center in dublin and new data center in singapore later in the year to support the growing – into growing international demand for cloud in apac our growth drivers include our leadership brand position in the enterprise market for sales performance management our broad founder appeal to the major enterprise cloud vendors our spectrum of cloud capability and our cross sell opportunity into our expanding base currently  of our top  customers based on our new contract value are using multiple products this endorse is our multiproduct strategy and i believe the customers using multiple products have better retention characteristics our product innovation this year is focused on competitive sales performance management the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques and technologies datahug and thunderbridge are central to that strategy our multilevel marketing incentive solutions and a continued enterprise focus of our learning and customer experience businesses are also central to our innovative roadmap in  at the same time the new asc  rules regarding revenue from customers with contracts are fundamental of occasions for the automation of incentive commissions and commissions accounting going forward additionally the department of labor fiduciary rules whether or enforced or not are also having an effect on the automation needs in financial services and insurance continuing my analysis of growth drivers i believe that we’ve been able to attract great talent we have hired additional productive sales capacity i believe our ability to onboard and enable sales talent is a key differentiator our sales enablement litmos mobile learning and cpq solutions are central to getting our sales reps productive faster sales people also want to work through winters and our recognition as an industry leader on multiple fronts helps attract top sales talent and to that our partnerships with a life of sap salesforce accenture to lloyd adp and others and we have one of the most compelling opportunities for saas sales talent in the industry we have our largest sales book camp in q and i’m very pleased to report that over  of the new hires contributed to new bookings in the quarter great start for those sales people as i said earlier i was pleased with our saas revenue growth in q turning to the second quarter our pipeline is healthy and i believe we can achieve  to  saas revenue growth whilst we make money i’ll now handover to roxanne to provide more details on our financial performance roxanne oulman thank you leslie and good afternoon everyone as leslie noted the first quarter was a strong start of the year for callidus with strong new customer additions as well as compelling upsell and cross sell performance with our large and growing existing customer base we’re convinced that balancing growth and profitability is the foundation for our future as we’ve outlined in the past our nearterm goal is to maintain the rule of  which is based on the some of saas yearoveryear revenue growth in annual nongaap operating margin equating to  or better last week we filed our proxy which demonstrates our commitment as our  cash bonus performance goals are tied to both saas revenue growth and nongaap operating margin improvement in addition our  base stock plan includes goals tied to threeyear saas revenue growth and nongaap operating margin improvement these goals in line with achieving  million in annual saas revenue while improving operating margin approaching  let me turn to the numbers as usual all of our nonrevenue financial figures i’ll discuss today are nongaap as always you will find a reconciliation from gaap to nongaap results in today’s press release for q saas revenue was  million representing a growth of  and a sequential uptick of over  million total revenue was  million an increase of  million or  over q of  as a reminder in q we essentially completed all of our material on premise conversion as we expected our q maintenance revenue was cut in half from the prior quarter a reduction of over  million dollar sequentially from q maintenance revenue accounted for less than  of recurring revenue in q our services revenue was  million for the quarter and grew  over that for the same period last year our services business in q benefited from our strong booking performance in the back half of  as a reminder services revenue ebbs and flows based on a variety of factors we view services as an enabling function that is ancillary to our saas software business which drive the real growth and value to our shareholders as you know we evaluate our business on four key metrics saas revenue growth saas deferred revenue normalized saas billings and nongaap operating margin saas revenue grew  in q saas deferred revenue grew  over q  to  million i’m pleased that we have crossed  million milestone in q saas billings growth was  and normalized saas billings growth was  during the quarter the mix of contracts with annual return was  and this fluctuates quarterly based on contracts customer and product mix during q there were no multiyear billings as a reminder our normalized adjusted – normalized adjustment takes into account remaining acquired deferred and the impact of multiyear billings in the current and prior year as you know there are a wide variety of factors that influence billings and therefore quartertoquarter fluctuations in calculated billings should not be taken as an indication of changes in future revenue due to the quarterly variability we believe that assessing our billings performance on a trailing month basis offers a better perspective as you’ll see in our press release normalized saas billings growth was a strong  for the trailing month period some additional highlights for q are our product or multiproduct strategy continues to show signs of success as we closed  multiproduct deals in the quarter enterprises are continuing to standardize on callidus best upgrade solution turning to the pl recurring revenue gross margin was  this was in line with our expectations as we outlined in our last earnings call we’re investing and will continue to invest in additional data center capacity in order to serve our growing customer base across the globe we continue to expect recurring gross margins will range from  to  for the remainder of the year in q services gross margin was  we will continue to leverage our implementation partners and we expect services gross margin to trend between  and  turning to our nongaap operating expenses sales and marketing expenses were  million or  of revenue in q we will continue to invest in our productive sales capacity to support  and beyond as we see continued market momentum this was demonstrated by our largest new hire sales book camp which took place in q as leslie mentioned earlier we expect sales and marketing expense to trend in the range of  to  of revenue for the remainder of the year rd expense was  million for the quarter and  of total revenue we expect rd expense to be around  to  of revenue in  ga expenses were  million or  of revenue we’re pleased with the leverage we’ve been able to realize within our ga organization we expect ga expense to be between  and  of revenue for the remainder of the year nongaap operating income in the first quarter improved  to  million compared to  million in q of  ebitda for the first quarter increased  to  million compared to  million in q of  diluted weighted average shares outstanding were  million cash taxes for the first quarter were  cash and investments were  million at the end of the quarter cash flow from operations for q was  million representing  of revenue now let me turn to our financial outlook for q and full year  for q of  we are projecting saas revenue to be between  million and  million in the quarter this represents growth of  to  growth over last year we project maintenance revenue to be in the range of  to  with total revenue between  million and  million for q we expect nongaap operating income to be in the range of  million to  million and nongaap pretax income of  million to  million we estimate incurring  to  in cash taxes for q we expect basic weighted average shares outstanding to be between  million and  million shares and diluted weighted shares outstanding to be between  million and  million shares lastly we are projecting cash flow from operations will remain positive and we expect capital expenditures to be between  million and  million in the quarter for the full year we’re updating our prior annual saas revenue guidance to be between  million to  million representing a growth rate of  to  we’re updating our  maintenance revenue guidance to  million to  million as a result we’re updating our guidance for total revenue to be between  million and  million this represents total revenue growth of  to  for the year for  we expect nongaap operating income

balancing growth and profitability and are excited about our future growth opportunities as the market leader with the strongest industry analysts and partner positioning we’ve ever had in the company’s history now we can turn the call over to qa operator will you please prompt for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from michael nemeroff with credit suisse your line is now open michael nemeroff hey guys thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a nice quarter a couple of quite just actually one for leslie and then maybe one for roxanne leslie yes i think the number was  on the multiproduct wins just curious about the size of those deals and also if you could maybe give us a sense for the combination of products are there any certain combinations that you’re seeing more of than others and then for roxanne just the rule of  taking in combination with the implied guide on the margin and the ondemand revenue growth i guess high  so where do you think the upside – if you had to handicap it would you say that there is more potential for upside on the revenue line the ondemand revenue or on the margin thanks leslie stretch well great questions the multiproduct deals none of the less than six figures are across the spectrum really in size cpq commissions cpq workflow commissions and litmos mobile learning and enablement and some customer feedback so across the spectrum but i’d say the bigger ones sales performance management sales execution that sort of thing roxanne oulman so michael in regards to the rule of  and our guidance for saas revenue was  to  and the operating margin guidance we’ve given you is  to  so the high end of that guidance is what aligns with the rule of  michael nemeroff okay thank you very much for taking my questions roxanne oulman thank you operator thank you our next question comes from alex zukin with piper jaffray your line is open alex zukin hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats leslie for you so now that the conversion story is especially over i guess two questions are you seeing any kind of productivity uplift in redeploying those sales resources onto new logos and also are you seeing signs of being able to or examples of actually now that these customers have been converted the opportunity to upsell them into more of lead to money suite leslie stretch yes great question i think last piece first i think converting is a big thing we’ve got all of that really behind us as few small ones to do we’re getting them live so we will get to the cross sell early days for that first quarter for a lot of them so early days for that i think to be honest with you in terms of our productivity i’ve made some commentary around the appetite of the salesforce it’s all of our cross sell and new business and our  of our largest intake ever actually make an acv contribution several have been contribution some of them paying their salaries back in their first quarter which i was like to see and some of them doing much more is a fantastic outcome and none of those guys have heard our conversions or onprem so that’s a wonderful outcome so we can really get about a business that really love and want to be focused on which is selling cloud i’m taking people from on printer cloud that’s kind of very – as you know very time consuming energy sapping actually now we’ve got all of our energy focused on new business and it’s formidable to see q is as you know is normally a quiet quarter seasonally lot of people came back to work on january  or  or wherever it was all guns blazing great team and they did a great and it’s all about as cross sell product new business acquisition across industries and we don’t have to have this kind of activity energy sapping activity which was geared around the conversions so i’m really pleased about the start of  alex zukin got it and then maybe one more if you think about your pipeline your partnerships into the extent that they’re contributing to your pipeline and also any impact on the seasonality from modeling perspective for us either on saas billings or saas revenue with the movement of c out of q into q leslie stretch so i will try and do the financial around the c in billings and where we thought this year – we’re going to sapphire for the first time is going to be facing  people at that event we’ve done a number of industry roadshow london and quite a bit eric and rory and the rest of the team have been on the road constantly it’s – the marketing events we executed in q are lined up in future i’m really happy with i think we’ve actually played a great hand because as a ton of conference is going on not eating for the same oxygen especially in san francisco i was reading about one yesterday about the dwindling audience great company great presentations but really its only so many buyers to go around in may and so i think we called a blinder i’m really pleased but we’re going to be very active from a marketing perspective all the way through to c and then green force in q so we’ve got a beautiful lineup of gotomarket events not to mention not forget digital digitals review as big for us as well so that is a constant ongoing theme so i think we’re in great shape i don’t think we’ll see any change to what we expect from seasonality because of c  we might see some financial spread here and there we’re spending on one thing versus another but i feel really good about our market footprint and the sales guys are absolutely out there all completely roxanne oulman so alex in respect to the billings growth as we have sapphire in q which is first time will be at time we’re very excited about the opportunity to brings us and the continually marking events we have we anticipate that the billings growth will follow the historical seasonality we’ve seen before as q and q tend to be our strongest quarters alex zukin perfect thanks guys roxanne oulman thank you operator thank you our next question comes from justin furby with william blair your line is open justin furby thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter and leslie can you start i guess just in terms of the enterprise pipeline can you provide some color there maybe talk about the kind of growth you’re seeing there yearoveryear and then for sap sapphire still of coming but are you seeing signs that they’re already adding to enterprise pipeline in a subset of layers is it too early and then multipart question the very last part is when you look at your enterprise pipe how much of it would you say is multiproduct versus just a single part commission andor another product like cpq thanks leslie stretch great questions i think the first question was around sap i think i’ve got reached to the side line yes seeing great contribution from sap in q we’ve already started and we’ve done the deal prosecuted at deal in q already but we’re seeing great quality that’s the same quality enterprise customer quality from that new channel but we’re also seeing good momentum deal with adp on the learning side we’re also had a solid q on the salesforce again very nice we’ve uplevel that partnership accenturea is a great partner for the commission business in terms of the larger deals in terms of the pipeline is bigger than last year i don’t know if i want to get people crossed up and safe much but i’m pleased with the size of the pipeline and i’m very pleased with the congregational partner business through that but in terms of multiproduct the larger deals tend to be multiproduct the high six figures or seven figures i’m looking at the moment for the remainder of the year a very few of them are single product it was perhaps one or two they’re all multiproduct and as those combinations are on configure price quote commissions are learning enablement leaning enablement commissions is not front of the combination justin furby perfect that’s helpful and then one more if i can you throw a lot of drivers around adoption of spm i guess i wonder if there is maybe one in particular that was a change or something worth calling out even over the last  days or so thanks leslie stretch yes so no i think it was in the combination of bigger geographic footprint bigger salesforce there are some industry specific things i think the asc  focus has been about – has been focus on revenue and accounting people are beginning to realize now actually the big part of it is about commissions and cost accounting and not a huge maybe how an automated commissions it’s a problem and for large enterprises there are many choices to get that right i think other thing i didn’t mention was i feel actually quite confident about european business this year european business we have some thoughts around brexit and political shift and rest of it but business continues as it continues to rain in europe just as always rolling business continues to progress and are quite excited about the european teams progress justin furby got it thanks very much and congrats operator thank you our next question comes from brian schwartz of oppenheimer your line is now open brian schwartz yes hi thanks for taking my questions this afternoon leslie i want to build upon the partnership commentary certainly exciting news that happened in the quarter i’d like to take it in different direction with sap specifically that business has material exposure to emerging market it’s an investable team that i’ve been using on sap stock here over the last  months so think about your business and you think about expanding geographically and entering new markets does the enhance sap partnership does this speed up the international opportunity of a calliduscloud and then the second question i want to ask you on the geography is just how do you balance the investment decisions between going deeper in the geographies where the business is already well established like you are in the uk like you are in germany first pursuing some of these newer regions leslie stretch great well that’s a great question i’ll talk about first and then roxanne will tell you the rule of  guideline is gives us the financial discipline but also is what  just to balance sheet investment because if you ask the sales leaders in north america and emea right now they both one more everything more marketing more digital marketing more quarter variant sales sides last year i think we were a bit sensitive around europe because of brexit i think i don’t regret that because we focused on north american we had bumper q and q i think we’re on seeing now and when you talk about sap is i think it is having an effect on the – a material effect on the european pipeline i’m excited about the deals what i see in the european pipeline and some of those are driven by there is a coverage of the partner because we don’t have massive coverage there as you know but it is growing but we do have seasoned effective enterprise sales people who culturally are well aligned with our sap counterparts i don’t pleased to see the initial progress that we’re making so i totally agree sap doing good in north america as always and we have a good pipeline opportunities there but the partner you from us as a spread its sales forces sap as adt is accenture is still i follow those i agree with you on sap in europe in particular brian schwartz great leslie one on followup just on the market and then i have a followup for roxanne i’m just wondering if you’re seeing any shifts in terms of kind of the core selling the core commissions management product in general in the market versus the same greenfield and spread shift – spreadsheets excuse me versus a ripping and replacing a competing automated solutions is it still mostly greenfield opportunity therein in that one product that the commission’s management leslie stretch no no i think we did wanted two replacements and i’ve always said replacements take a lot of time we’ve been replace when there such a greenfield opportunity when look at just at the mlm market that entire market space which spends disproportionately on commissions has no challenger are offering today i’m going to first move there and there all old environment old made frames spreadsheets we have customers with hundreds of people managing commissions respect to around the world large enterprise customers so it’s still very much replacing old automated technologies and techniques brian schwartz thank you and then my last question for roxanne here it’s a kind of going – it’s a question around the predictability of the model here because this is the third straight quarter now of results either meeting or exceeding the estimates you’ve been cfo for couple of quarters now but you’ve also how managed the financials at calliduscloud for a lot longer i just want to ask you is anything changed here in the recent quarters that is improving the predictability of the model is maybe having the conversions mostly done leslie i think talked about in the introductory comments although the lead generation is really accelerating i just wondering if anything had changed here that that’s helping the predictability of the model thanks again for taking my questions this afternoon roxanne oulman brian its – nearly four years and has been very active in building and improving our finance organization and been the cfo for the last couple quarters in regards to our visibility one of the things we all really like about the saas model is the visibility and having the conversion behind us is really key not only from the ability to allow our sales organization to focus on new logos and cross sell and upsell but also it removes some of the ebbs and flows that we’ve seen that were tied to that version so we’re excited about the opportunity we’ll continue to obviously monitor things closely and we try to provide guidance that we think is reasonable and we think is achievable brian schwartz thanks again good job on the quarter roxanne oulman thank you operator thank you our next question comes from richard baldry with roth capital your line is open richard baldry thanks you’re adding significant partners and some of them are competitors of each other if you talk a little bit about how you manage the end markets or any potential conflicts but you see as you gave experience with that leslie stretch sure it was a great question i think we – but one of our my background as you may know it’s channels is running channels and running large channels managing multiple players there’s some really good things going on actually and then where you’ve got one player very strong with a certain industry and strong in a certain geography another player with another segment and so it’s actually kind of working out we don’t have we don’t selling in china will conflict new things we don’t with multiple claims reduced and so at this stage one day i’m sure we will so it’s actually working out pretty well and i have to say probably more about less than judgment right we didn’t design that way because these parties came to us and i think the same is true in the si grouping the si grouping you have one i don’t want to name of that one partner has a very specific high tech practice for example another one with a big telco big financial services practice and that’s worked out very very well growth now i’m sure my guys are running the channel would have a much more eloquent answer so that they design that they probably did but from what the way i see it it’s a great decision obviously we need to work with us so far there’s a lot to go on there’s a lot of opportunity to go on the different segments and we haven’t had to waste any energy dealing with channel conflict that’s a great question richard baldry and it sales side seeing pretty fast for some of your new hires so can you talk about how that is is there a change to life which products are i mean more more productive as entry points for now and for that they get to cross selling down the road and how is it they could be moving in but i would have thought would be a pipeline development instead they are moving into closing cycles thanks leslie stretch well i – yes i get that and i’m – i was pleased to see that i wasn’t going to really say this but we know we had one guy doing  kacb deal who was at the blue camp in january joined on january rd i don’t want to get into it to a professional about stuff like that but yes great great great great deal very seasoned guy seasoned background – top gun hard worker so i think it’s actually reflective of a time right off the markets that were addressing were not just in one market with one product i think it’s reflective of the secular trial movement that we’re part of and we can’t claim responsibility for that i think that it’s a product spectrum right and i think it’s word in mouth and reputation that would be spread taking up as perfect but i think our reputation is strong and then the industry analyst came out great guns great job by our marketing team with unsung heroes in the company phenomenal job explaining and expressing the proposition so all of those things help and i think contributed what you were pointing on acceleration of campaigns and i know the talent that we got is better now we just not to say that people that we hired three four five years ago we’re not as part but they’ve grown into great executives and they heplps us attract along with the industry analysts in our success really great talent and i still maintain that the big secret in cloud is to commit the customer for life through an account management regime and that account managers can actually be very well they can make the lot of money through cross sell and up sell over time by looking after their customers it’s not just about hunting a new business although we all have the hunters on the new business fields we had a very good new business process richard baldry great thanks operator thank you our next comes from chad bennett with craighallum your line is open chad bennett great thanks for fit me in so couple of questions leslie maybe you can kind of i know you don’t want to quantify the pipeline or the increase in the pipeline but can you talk to – speak to a little bit about the composition of the pipeline this year versus maybe year ago this quarter and then as much as you care to speak about products within the pipeline that are showing growth in excess of your saas growth that would be helpful also leslie stretch great great question i think with some service cpq showing – good showing in the pipeline today the new product data how it is beginning to really quite exciting i have to say very small business that’s actually are going to be very good growth great enterprise traction with that baseline and big customers with telco’s mobile learning going – moving the selling price up in mobile learning commissions great guns great guns especially with the sap and salesforce partnerships and then every demo i’m attending quite a few demos either in person or by whether they – every demo is including analytics and thunderbridge thunderbridge is going to be a great tool not just for analyzing the performance of your products your extra plans et cetera but for building and making your plans to become a planning through and so really excited about that all appearing in the pipeline chad bennett got it and then i think you answered my question this is next question but i just want to make sure we kind of get it in public so to speak so are you seeing or should we think about any deceleration in the commissions or incentive comp growth rate for callidus leslie stretch no it’s great it’s a better for the business it’s a great business i think the other thing we talked about in our europe and one of the other questions so that’s kind of producing a nice pipeline for us now commissions a lot of these enterprise commissions commissions was at that lock q spm great great business for us chad bennett okay leslie stretch enterprises especially but smb to we – i think i listed some open commissions deals in the prepared not so really quite exciting chad bennett okay and then the last one maybe for roxanne so i know you don’t necessarily give billings growth estimates or you are talk about billings much but is there any reason why we should think about whether you want to say saas deferred rev growth or billings growth this year for the year being any different than your saas revenue guidance growth guidance roxanne oulman no as you know the billings growth fluctuates from quartertoquarter last year if you look at the full year billings growth guidance it was in line with our saas revenue growth and we don’t anticipate that overall billings revenue growth would be consistent with our saas revenue growth we did provide that month trailing revenue – excuse me month trailing billings revs you have that visibility and you could see that correlation over time chad bennett great nice job again on somewhat of a tough comp on the quarter roxanne oulman thank you chad leslie stretch thank you operator thank you our next question comes from kevin liu with b riley your line is open kevin liu hi good afternoon first one just a quick followup on the accounting standards exchange just curious if that’s helping to drive faster decision making earlier in this year or if you don’t think that’s necessarily the case leslie stretch i think that is got some good views on the pipeline because people are realizing they can’t answer the questions around cost they’re trying to automate the revenue side and they’re trying to do cost on spreadsheets and we’re interested in the very large enterprise this year are there some small public companies are going to go through this  change as well but the large enterprise is got big double in their hand you can’t do this up spreadsheets you can’t do reliably you’re going to make mistakes it should be an audit committee subject of discussion every single board in the country public companies and they focused too much on the revenue side so now people are beginning to realize they don’t have an answer for commissions and our patented rules based approach to commission’s automation is key to solving that problem kevin liu great and then switching gears to litmos you talk about some nice enterprise wins there when you guys first acquired that seem to be more of a volume business but at this point you see a litmos successfully moving up market unless you give us some relative kind of increases in ast’s that you’ve seen over time that would be helpful and just lastly are you mentioned adp as a partner there i’m not expecting to add some additional partners to that platform leslie stretch yes i think this litmos is already starts to show enterprise traction with some of wins i think we’ve listed a few reprotect companies hitech companies launch hitech companies software services hardware adopted litmos in certain segments is regarded as a market leader we’re not in government we’re not in federal we’re not in k ph keep that in mind is we’re the commercial states today it’s a good high growth business for us it’s a super technology and the litmos team that we have in the business are a highly committee high energy team that is all in on mobile learning and we’ve also got the training of capability through the central that we acquired a year ago and we also have bridge from the contact capability we’re looking at adding to contact capability but it’s a solution that is taken seriously by enterprise as view as a market leader we’ve got great customers across industries hitech retail financial services and my view is that we’re going to continue to see material increases in average selling prices we’re doing six state of deals now that we weren’t doing there are certain figure deals ahead of us no question and mobile learning because of our unique combination of content content management training ups and mobile the backward i think is the best mobile learning solutions in the world kevin liu hi great well congrats on a great quarter as well and thanks for taking the questions leslie stretch thank you operator thank you our next question comes from eric martinuzzi with lake street capital your line is open eric martinuzzi hey i got a question on the analytics product analytics means a lot of things to a lot of people if this is where you are pointed with your analytics product that’s strictly at spm because i could see it – i could see wonderful outcomes from analytics against cpq or clm even learning where are you what’s the on tray and then what’s the potential here leslie stretch i think that is a very good question great insightful question because every session every demo thunderbridge i want to see customers who have cpq and proposals the questions but i want to see answer to what’s the relationship between my leads my pipeline my proposals and my contract and my commissions payout and those are the questions that thunderbridge ultimately is designed to answer today you are right it’s focused on the sales performance management data set because it’s mounted very potent technically accessing that data and answering questions the key questions of cfo’s had an sales was a big challenge we’ve overcome that next we’re going to take it i think cpq and then we are going to look at the contract data set as well so ultimately the idea is to have that analytic solution looking across the spectrum eric martinuzzi okay and then as far as it’s obviously early it is just came out of the product but the potential for penetration and i don’t know if there’s a right way to describe it see the up lift what percentage just the spm installed base is test driving there is and then what percentage you think it’s a natural for leslie stretch we have time to a dozen customers already using the solution it absolutely in my opinion is essential for every customer that uses commissions every single customer that looks at that sales performance commissions they listen asked questions about characterization quotas product performance margins right performance think about all of the implications all the questions that you can ask using that technology that you can before no one else does it effectively this is the fact i mean they can make an all try and gamut no because this effectively take this three years to built the technology there is no shortcut it absolutely game changing on every single one of our commissions customers needs to have that eric martinuzzi okay so  to  customers on your way to  leslie stretch  eric martinuzzi okay thanks for taking my questions leslie stretch offended your question operator thank you we have time for one more question our question comes from ilya grozovsky with national securities your line is open ilya grozovsky thanks just had a quick question on the gross margins if you could just provide a little more color on kind of it had been pretty stable in the last four quarters looks like a tick down i know you guys had some expenses that you put in there but kind of a little more color on that and what it looks like going forward thanks roxanne oulman ilya we’ve been making some significant investments in our data centers not only to provide the stateoftheart the capital in response to the number of customers we brought onboard we had record bookings quarters in q and q and brought on several large multiproduct enterprise customers in addition to that we are expanding our data centre footprint in emea and apac so as a result when we provided guidance in q we guided to  to  gross margin we still think that that is world class we think world class gross margins are between  and  that’s where you’ve seen a small decrease in  so far ilya grozovsky great thank you roxanne oulman thank you operator thank you i would now like turn the call back over to leslie stretch for any further remarks leslie stretch thanks for taking time with us today we look forward to talking to you all next quarter operator ladies and gentlemen thank

sandhill leadership thursday april   mr asks  questions leslie stretch calliduscloud mr rangaswami cofoundersand hill group leslie stretch has executed one of the biggest turnarounds in recent software history as ceo of sales performance management software maker calliduscloud since taking the helm in  he has moved the company to a recurringrevenue cloudbased model and moved from negative territory to a  billion business in the process i asked leslie how he did it mr callidus has reinvented itself – both productwise and financially you’ve got  million in cash and have grown your saas business  percent for each of the past three years – profitably  thinking back over your journey as ceo do you remember the strategic decisions that proved key to your eventual success leslie stretch when i stepped into the ceo position i made a personal decision to be “all in” – that is physically financially and emotionally committed to the business  i’m proud that callidus’ valuation has increased  times since i joined but its success is not because of me i was lucky to join a capable highperformance team and go “all in” together  the biggest business decision we made was to go to the cloud we made that decision at the end of  and invested disproportionately in building a modern multitenant cloud platform to provide our sales incentives capability to companies of all sizes and industries it was incredibly important to have a supportive board during this period it was also key to keep the core technical architects of the old business and to part ways with managers who couldn’t get to the cloud the second critical decision was to move from a point solution to a broader suite just as salesforce has done and just as oracle and sap did before everyone else we agreed to do this through buying and building capability we build a lot of new software every year and we do not look to our competitors to drive our pace of change we committed to original innovation in partnership with our customers  the service we give customers is central to our culture because as a saas company we make a lifetime commitment not a product sale to make this all happen profitably we first recognized that we didn’t have other people’s money to burn once you internalize that reality and couple it with the fact that you are already public you have no choice but to embrace the right financial discipline every one of our team members has had to personally sacrifice to make the bottom line on occasion but they have been rewarded through the steady improvement in valuation – which still has a very long way to go mr the american business awards named you as their computer services “executive of the year” in  what was the best part about being recognized for your work what other ceos do you look up to leslie  i attribute this award to our team i am not a high profile ceo in fact i have never picked up any of my awards i am grateful for each one but i let one of my team members go and receive the public accolades they deserve in fact a funny thing happened when our emea europe middle east  africa leader christina kemper arrived in rome to accept a recent award they thought she was me – “leslie” – and that was just fine with me when i look at the occupation line on my passport it says “software builder” as it has for thirty years it reminds me that i am still doing the same thing at callidus that i’ve always done working with a great team to build software that outinnovates other companies and satisfies the needs of our customers that’s why i admire salesforce ceo marc benioff i believe he is the leader of a movement not a company he is a solid example for all ceos a great leader for his employees and the industry and “all in” for his company and his team i also consider sap ceo bill mcdermott to be one of the most underrated leaders in software the sap machine is much more potent than people think bill has built a great company with a fabulous history and a super culture  mr calliduscloud was recently honored as a “great place to work” what have you and your team done to earn this designation  leslie well  i don’t think we have done enough yet we are working hard to follow a philosophy that elevates “critical nonessentials” it’s an oxymoron but its meaning is very important to me many things that management considers “nonessentials” – such as a nice work environment delicious free coffee entertainment a gym great healthcare a genuine concern for our team members well being compassion for life impacts – are actually “critical” to hardworking people i find many executives greatly underestimate the importance of these items at callidus we have a lexicon of forbidden words including “employee” “staff” “corporate” “headquarters” and many other old world business terms because again our success is all about our team of “people” at the end of the day all we have is one another because we make millions selling electrons – it’s weird but true  a software product doesn’t really matter on its own so at callidus we believe our people are central to everything we do    mr rangaswami is the cofounder
