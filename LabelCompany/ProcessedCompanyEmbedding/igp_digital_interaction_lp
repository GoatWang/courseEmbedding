avoid confusion it is the yard stick that not only helps us find our way but also measure our progress so what is are our ethos we took a year to think about it not because we are dumb but we wanted to get our dna right we wanted to get our market right we wanted to get our approach right and finally we found salvation in  simple and often much talked about words innovative it’s much easier said than done innovation doesn’t necessarily mean invention as most of us naïve souls believe innovation is simply about doing things better  more efficiently innovation is about new simpler solutions to same old complex problems all of us really need to be “innovative” in our approach to every problemtask that we handle every day – doesn’t matter how big or small – behind every giant leap there are a  small innovations agile we live in a really dense forest where only the fittest  the scariest survive today the only constant thing in this world is “change” if you cannot adapt cannot think on your feet cannot pull out a feather from your cap and cannot do all of this quickly enough you will not survive you might be a dinosaur today but it’s the agile  clever fox that will have the last laugh  million years from now consumercentric so you are innovative you are agile but remember you are not doing this for yourself you are doing all this for our end consumer if heshe doesn’t benefit none of it matters we got limited time money energy  ideas – so let’s put our money where the mouth is innovative agile consumercentric – that’s our ethos everything we think we do we focus on is guided by

bullshit we don’t throw jargons without even knowing their spellings in the first place we are not the poster boys we are not the next big unicorn we are not steve jobs we are not hyperxyz we are just entrepreneurs who understand their consumers we are not dry cleaners we don’t dryclean unwanted laundry we only focus on tech products which cater to established deeprooted and realworld problems – and when we identify such a product we don’t dry clean it we rinse it wash it dry it iron it pack it up nicely and then only ship it to the consumer we are not gold diggers we strive to create value not valuation – valuation will follow we prioritize for  years not for the next round of funding our consumers determine our products and our products determine our investors not the other way round
