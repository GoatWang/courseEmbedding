resorts is currently fairly valuedanalyst adam velji bcom  uncertainty surrounding summer operations justifies markets valuation while intrawest resort holdings nysesnow has successful winter operations  from their mountain and adventure segment  their yearly performance is regularly depleted due to the seasonality of their business however intrawest is well positioned to invest more in their summer operations due to the recent sale of intrawest resort club gro up which unlocked capital for the company if intrawest could successfully implement an established summer business they would have the opportunity to reduce seasonality and increase their summer earnings however due to stiff competition during the summer climate change and the capital intensity it could be a hard task for company which provides uncertainty for consistent future growth valuation  recommendation we determined a weighted target share price of  on intrawest resort holdings using our implied dcf share price and our average evebitda multiple we decided to weight the stock  and  respectively due to significant risks within the industry such as climate change competition and capital intensity versus the ability for the company to grow its summer operations we think the market is pricing the stock fairly therefore we decided to place a hold rating business overviewfundamentals business overview intrawest is a mountain resort adventure and real estate development company the company operates within these three segments with mountain resorts making up most of their business this segment operates and maintains six wholly owned mountain resorts throughout north america the adventure segment focuses on the operation of canadian mountain holidays cmh which provides heliskiing services while the real estate division consists of development and real estate operations intrawest is based out of delaware colorado and was previously known as intrawest caymans lp before going public on january th  the company provides customers with over  skiable acres from the mountain segment approximately  million tenured acres from the adventure segment and  acres of land held for real estate development mountain segment intrawests mountain segment includes the operations of their ski resorts and lodges located throughout several cities in north america they wholly own and operate six of their fourseason resorts which include a total of  skiable acres of land which are geographically diversified across major ski regions which include the eastern united states the rocky mountains and eastern canada intrawest has located their ski resorts with an average proximity of  miles  kilometers around major urban markets which include high concentrations of beginner to affluent snowboarders and skiers these major areas include new york city boston washington denver pittsburgh montreal and toronto steamboat ski resort is located in the rocky mountains  miles west from denver colorado and

with a vertical drop of  feet the resort contains a village which offers guests with a variety of dining nightlife and retail options source sec filings on a yearly average close to  of intrawests revenue comes from their mountain operations this revenue comprises of many elements which may include items such as lift lodging and ski school revenues in intrawests  fiscal year it was reported that  of the m in revenue derived from mountain operations came from lift activities this includes the sale of lift tickets season passes and other items and packages adventure segment source sec filings the adventure segment is mainly focused on the operations of canadian mountain holiday cmh which is a heliskiing adventure company based out of canada the business currently operates in the purcell selkirk monashee and cariboo mountains in eastern british columbia from  lodges  of which intrawest owns the company also plans on building another lodge to increase their capacity in order to meet demands the lodges provide visitors with approximately  million skiable acres which is granted under  and year renewable licenses from british columbia historically most of cmh customers are repeat customers mainly coming from canada and the united states however customers also come from europe and other countries throughout the world during off peak seasons cmh offers a variety of summer adventure packages which include heli hiking rock climbing and other lodging experiences intrawest also owns  helicopters in addition to operating alpine aerotech lp which is a helicopter repair maintenance and overhaul business in addition to servicing intrawests own fleet of helicopters alpine aerotech also caters their business to  customers throughout the world intrawest also leases their helicopters during the summer period in order to combat against wildfire disasters as a whole the adventure segment has contributed a total of  of intrawests revenue during the  fiscal year real estate segment intrawests real estate segment includes the operations of real estate management marketing and sales in addition to real estate development activities the segment includes intrawest hospitality management ihm playground and intrawest resort club group ircg before the sale of that business on january th  ihm manages hotel condominium properties throughout north america and focuses on providing management services to properties owned by third parties those third party resorts include honua kai resort and spa in maui hawaii and the westin monache resort at mammoth lakes california playground acts as a real estate sales and marketing business for intrawests development projects the brand is used in resale and brokerage operations at intrawest resorts intrawest hopes to use playground to provide sales and marketing expertise for the properties they develop surrounding the land of their resorts ircg develops sells and manages a pointsbased timeshare vacation club called club intrawest club intrawest was sold to diamond resorts international in which intrawest profited from a  million gain the transaction included all of nine club intrawest sites which are located throughout canada the united states and mexico without having to spend capital on operating ircg we think intrawest can now allocate more funds towards their mountain and adventure segment in the future in the  fiscal year the real estate segment accounted for  of intrawests total revenue max pass multi resort product the max pass is a season pass created by intrawest powdr and boyne resorts that provides pass holders with the opportunity to gain access to  different resorts across north america pass holders will obtain  days at each of those resorts and will not be limited to any blackout periods the pass costs  for adults  for teenagers  for youth and  for children intrawest credits the pass with providing strong growth towards lift revenues as all of intrawests six resorts can be accessed with the pass the max pass also helps to reduce risk as a majority of sales occur before the start of the ski season which protect intrawest from uncertain weather conditions growth strategy historically intrawest has experienced stagnant growth over the last five years on average the company has achieved  annual growth in revenues with the  increase between the  and  fiscal years contributing significantly to that figure this was mostly caused by good weather conditions at intrawest resorts which caused visitation rates to increase from m visitors to m visitors however intrawest felt a slight decrease in revenue during their  fiscal year mostly contributed from a third quarter decrease in revenue from their mountain segment compared to  fiscal figures source sec filings looking into the fiscal  quarters intrawest experiences most of their earnings during q this is mainly because of optimal weather conditions that attract customers to intrawests mountain resorts and cmh conversely due to poor ski conditions during q and q intrawest often produces lower earnings during those seasons of the year historically this has been the case for intrawest and has forced the company to think beyond just winter operations source sec filings in the future intrawest expects to grow their operations and increase their earnings during off snow seasons by growing the amount of summer amenities available at their resorts they have integrated this strategy at both steamboat and winter park resorts both resorts accompanied with adventure zones golfing mountain biking water sports rock climbing villages and other experiences and activities most recently intrawest has developed their blue mountain summer amenities and plans to expand their mont tremblant resort because intrawest has seen success with the new integration of summer amenities their plan to grow their summer operations organically could reduce to seasonality of the business however they do face significant competition we believe intrawests investment into their summer operations is vital for the growth of the business as the threat of climate change and unpredictable weather conditions will continue to provide volatility for their winter operations a lack of snowfall could significantly hurt intrawest winter operations which could hurt their future growth as that is when the company earns most of their revenue however aside from investment into summer operations we think intrawest could grow their earnings with inorganic growth through acquisitions and investment into their snowmaking capabilities a future acquisition could help geographically diversify intrawests resort portfolio which would protect it from poor regional weather conditions while greater snowmaking capabilities will produce snow for less optimal conditions we feel that for this season the number of visitation rates will increase due to optimal conditions that have been experienced at intrawest resorts however due to risks such as climate change competition and the seasonality of the business we feel that future revenues could be volatile in the few years after this season nevertheless we do believe intrawest management will adapt to the effects of climate change and competition by increasing investment into summer and winter operations which in turn could increase future revenues the macro environment industry overview intrawest operates in a mature highly competitive industry with a significant level of capital intensity historically mountain resorts have felt modest growth in the last five years despite unpredictable weather conditions according to ibisworld the north american ski and snowboard industry has generated b in revenue and has grown at a rate  and  in canada and the united states respectively the north american industry is expected to grow at an annualized rate of  in the next five years until  this is mainly due to the threat of climate change that may have a negative impact on the industry as a whole in canada a lower growth rate could be expected as the canadian dollar is in a volatile state source ibisworldcom source ibisworldcom although many domestic travelers may be attracted to visit mountain resorts international travelers may be less inclined to come overseas into canada because the canadian dollar may be unstable against their currency however an expected increase in per capita disposable income and the ability of large corporations such as intrawest and vail nysemtn to enjoy greater economies of scale will help the industry grow at a steady rate demand for ski and snowboard services are seasonal and greatly dependent on weather conditions resorts earn a significant portion of their annual revenue during the periods between november to april unfavourable weather conditions would cause the demand for these services to decrease which could have a severe impact on annual revenue the present state of economic conditions in addition to the amount of available leisure time are also demand determinants for the industry concentration in the industry is also very high with only four firms making up  of the us market with that being said we think these companies will be able to expand their operations as they will have the capability to acquire many of the smaller companies that make up the rest of the market there are also significant barriers to entry for the industry due to land and government restrictions the amount of private land there is to successfully build a ski resort is often limited and secluded from large towns and main travel roads for public land getting provincialstate or federal approval is difficult although it is possible to lease land in the form of renewable permits or licenses from the government however these permits often come with many environmental regulations and supervision of development of the resort developing mountain resorts also requires vast capital investments with the probability that it may take a few years to make a return small firms looking to enter this market may not be able to withstand the capital requirements compared with larger firms which have access to more financing and the capital markets external drivers the mountain resort industry is led by certain external economic scenarios that drive revenue for the company these drivers include leisure time per capita disposable income and international travel the amount of leisure time available is an important factor because it provides an illustration of how much time an individual can allocate towards vacations and time off when the amount of leisure time increases the more likely an individual would take time off to go ski historically the hours per day per capita has remained steady in canada and the united states at approximately  hours and  hours per day per capita respectively forecasts for the future indicate that these levels will remain the same due to low unemployment rates and more leisure time allocated towards the elderly source ibisworldcom per capita disposable income is also an important measure in the mountain resort industry as it determines an individuals ability to purchase goods and services the more income an individual has after tax and other dues the more they have to spend on other items such as holidays which could translate into more spending at a ski resort in the united states per capita disposable income is expected to grow at an average of  per year until  whereas in canada it is expected to increase at an average rate of  per year until  this is slightly higher than their  and  historical averages respectively the amount of inbound travel made by international individuals is also a key driver for mountain resorts as many visitors often live overseas in canada this number of inbound trips has been increasing at an annualized rate of  however this number is expected to decrease at an annualized rate of  for the next five years this is due to the strength of the canadian dollar against other major currencies which make it more expensive for international travelers to visit canada in the united states inbound travel by internationals has been increasing at an annualized rate of  over the last five years and will continue to grow at an annualized rate of  over the next five years climate change climate change is continuing to be a major threat to the planet as there is increasing evidence that human emitted greenhouse gas emissions are the core reason for rising temperatures and unpredictable weather conditions the effects of global climate change are causing temperatures to rise sea levels to increase declining arctic ice warming oceans glacier retreat decreasing snow coverage and more historically over the period of  to  the average temperature in canada has risen by  degrees celsius according to the united states environmental protection agency epa the average temperature is expected to increase by  degrees celsius by  the agency also states that temperatures are expected to rise more on land rather than over the ocean and the level of precipitation is expected to decrease which would impact the level of snowfall we believe this would have an extremely negative impact to the mountain resort industry as a significant portion of their revenues are derived from their lift operations in the past seasons without significant snowfall generated losses for mountain resorts and often make customers skeptical on future conditions which have delayed them from buying season passes if temperatures continue to increase the level of snowfall is expected to decrease which in turn would cause mountain resorts to earn less revenue mountain resorts are taking part in many initiatives to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in addition to educating their customers on more sustainable environmental practices many resorts have set goals to make renewable energy purchases in the future in addition to using biofuels and renewable energy sources as well as promoting public transportation and recycling in the future we feel that intrawest should be increasing their capital expenditures to include a higher percentage of snowmaking machines this will enable intrawest to produce an adequate amount of snow during seasons with unpredictable snowfall new integrations of renewable energy sources will also allow intrawest to reduce their operating expenses in the long term while also reducing their carbon footprint competitors the industry in which intrawest operates in is highly competitive and is forecasted to continue being competitive into the future in canada the main competitors intrawest faces are whistler blackcomb which was recently acquired by vail resorts as well as other smaller and local resorts which include revelstoke banff big white and others in the united states the competition is fiercer with four of the largest operators controlling approximately  of the market those operators include vail resorts boyne resorts intrawest powdr and other small operators source ibisworldcom source ibisworldcom as there are strong barriers to entry for the industry the likelihood that new operators will join the market is highly unlikely however competitors have to pay close attention to the moves of each other to gain a competitive advantage resorts can do this by having effective cost control measures obtaining economies of scale being located close to major urban cities and increasing the number of snowmaking machines throughout their resort trails as the industry typically has high fixed costs a resort that can conduct a more efficient way of doing business and lower their costs could increase margins keeping these factors in mind intrawest fares particularly well against their competitors this is because the company is located in many key markets such as denver new york boston and toronto they also have snowmaking machines on  of their trails at their resorts with more risk to unpredictable weather changes however we think that intrawest could be more competitive in the industry by decreasing their costs as approximately  of the companys revenue is used towards operating expenses we believe this could be done by further investment into renewable energy resources which would be more cost efficient in the future furthermore intrawests investment into their technology and data analytics capabilities could also prove to decrease the amount of sga used to obtain and handle clients of the resorts intrawest should also increase the coverage of their snowmaking capabilities at all of their resorts as a precaution towards unpredictable weather conditions and climate change because it is harder for companies to build new resorts from the ground up due to regulation and high capital commitments firms usually try to gain an advantage by acquiring small operators that are close to key markets to achieve economies of scale also due to the risk of climate change or unpredictable weather conditions firms that invest more in snowmaking capabilities will be able to operate more efficiently during these periods although mountain resorts face aggressive competition within their own industry they also have external competitors which reside in other industries this is because there is a variety of other leisure activities individuals can decide to take part in besides visiting a mountain resort these competitors include but are not limited to casinos golf clubs adventure parks movie theaters cruise lines and hotels economic moats the most significant economic moat for the industry is a barrier to entry this is due to the intense regulation and capital commitments required to develop a new resort the amount of private land available for development is often away from major key markets and secluded from main roads furthermore gaining approval for resort development by the government is extremely difficult and comes with strict supervision and environmental regulation for new entrants the amount of capital required to start developing a resort can also be overwhelming especially due to the continuous cost of having to fund capital expenditures which could include maintenance and restoration smaller operators could potentially enter the market by acquiring resorts that have already been developed however they may not be able to withstand the length of time it takes to make a profitable return on a resort they also face fierce competition from larger operators that have allocated funds towards acquisitions and have other resorts in their portfolio to help them withstand the time it takes to earn a return resorts like intrawest can also fund the amount of capital expenditures required to maintain a new resort in addition to achieving economies of scale due to their network of mountains because of this barrier to entry we think this would give intrawest the opportunity to make an acquisition of another resort in the future because no new smaller entrants are expected to be a major threat in the industry this leaves smaller operators to be acquired by the larger corporations looking to gain a competitive advantage with a new resort intrawest will be able to geographically diversify their portfolio even more which could potentially increase the number of visitors at their resorts however although larger resorts have more capital the risk of capital intensity and an increase in capital expenditures is still a threat another economic moat intrawest has is in their adventure segment with the vertical integration of alpine aerotech lp because intrawest owns their own fleet of  helicopters used by cmh having this subsidiary will benefit intrawest if they acquire more helicopters in addition to keeping costs low when doing repairs and maintenance work on their current fleet we believe that the use of alpine aerotech could contribute to the growth of the adventure segment as the fleet of helicopters will be readily available to service cmh clients catalysts earnings report intrawest is expected to release q  earnings during may  the company usually has volatile earnings due to the seasonality of their business the last time intrawest reported positive earnings per share was during q  because of the revenue they generate during the ski season however the other three quarters reported negative earnings last quarter intrawest reported  earnings per share which beat analyst expectations of  this could be due to positive winter earnings which caused the stock to rise approximately  depending on what kind of earnings intrawest reports could have a dramatic impact on the performance of the stock due to positive snow conditions that will take place over the second half of the  ski season we expect that visitation rates to increase for intrawest which will contribute to stronger earnings for their third quarter weather conditions a good indicator of intrawests future earnings to investors could be the amount of snowfall received at their resorts typically seasons with good snowfall tend to be good quarters for the company because more customers visit their resorts this relationship is also true with seasons with bad snowfall which tend to be the worst quarters for the business because intrawest earns approximately  of their annual revenues during their q earnings it is extremely important to the company and their stock that the weather participates with them in the short term we think intrawest stock could become overvalued due to positive snow conditions compared to previous seasons which have experienced poor conditions we believe that this is the reason that the stock has had a  run up from the beginning of november  to midjanuary  however in the long term due to various external reasons that could harm revenue such as climate change we think that this could have a negative effect on stock performance if the value of the stock keeps increasing acquisitions because it is difficult for companies that operate within the mountain resort industry to gain the approval or raise the funds to build a new resort they often look to grow inorganically by acquisitions of fully functioning ones for intrawest to make another acquisition could mean that they have put themselves in a position to grow as purchasing a resort is a big commitment we think that the likelihood that intrawest will make a future acquisition of another resort in the united states or canada is positive this would be a strategic acquisition to further geographically diversify their resorts which would reduce the effect that climate change and unpredictable weather conditions may have however an acquisition could also have an inverse effect and cause the company to perform poorly because of the additional expenses the business has to take on in order to maintain the resort we think that an acquisition would decrease the value of intrawest stock in the short term due to this reason however if executed correctly an acquisition that could diversify intrawests portfolio could increase total revenues for the company deal rumors in recent months intrawest has been included in many reports which have stated that the company may be looking for a possible sale of its business we believe that buyers could include other private equity firms as well as buyout firms and real estate holding companies although the management of intrawest has stated that they would not comment on any market speculation we do have reason to believe that intrawest could realistically be involved in a future acquisition one reason could be that intrawests stock price has nearly doubled since fortress investment group intrawest majority stake holder took it public in early  the companys ipo price was initially  and has increased by approximately  to  during february  because of this we believe that fortress would be looking for an exit opportunity as the company has made a significant profit on its investment in intrawest another reason why fortress may want to sell intrawest could be because fortress was recently acquired by softbank otcpksftby which is a japanese telecommunications company the reason we believe that this could be a possible motivator for the sale of intrawest is because softbank has recently been acquiring many firms to diversify its reach into technology and fortress could be a potential gateway to acquiring more firms lastly another reason why intrawests management could be looking for a potential sale could be to free itself from having a company with a majority stake in it this could provide more flexibility to management in the way they conduct their business conversely they could also be looking for a potential sale of the entire business to a company that is more aligned with intrawests strategic goal of becoming a geographically diversified fourseason vacation resort any sale of intrawest would potentially increase the stock price as a buyer would usually have to pay a price of above the current market price as goodwill however a sale could also delist intrawest from the nyse and possibly make it a private company once again management team mr thomas marano  ceo director thomas marano is the chief executive officer

compensation of  mr marano owns  shares of intrawest common stock with the option to buy  more because both mr mayer and mr foulkes own more stock than mr marano we feel as though mr marano should exercise his options to make his goals and responsibilities more aligned with the company although we feel confident in mr maranos leadership ability which is demonstrated through his various executive roles we think that he may be lacking the necessary knowledge and expertise that may be required to operating a mountain resort travis mayer  cfo executive vice president treasurer travis mayer is the chief financial officer nasdaqcfo of intrawest and joined the firm in january  as a financial analyst prior to intrawest mr mayer was a world class olympic skier winning the olympic silver medal in addition to various other awards mr mayer also obtained a masters of business administration mba from harvard business school mr mayers fiscal  annual compensation was  which is composed of a base salary of  a bonus of  and other compensation of  mr mayer owns  shares of intrawest common stock which is  of all shares outstanding from the many skiing competitions that mr mayer has taken part in during his time as a professional skier we see that he has an obvious passion and commitment to the industry paired with his education we feel that mr mayer has the required drive and knowledge that may be required to continue the growth of intrawest into the future sky foulkes  coo executive vice president sky foulkes is the chief operating officer nysecoo of intrawest and obtained the position on november st  prior to intrawest mr foulkes was the vice president of operations at stratton mountain resorts where he started as a professional ski patrol officer in   years before the resort was acquired by intrawest mr foulkess fiscal  annual compensation was  which is composed of a base salary of  a bonus of  and other compensation of  mr foulkes owns  shares of intrawest common stock which is  of all shares outstanding due to mr foulkess long time history in the mountain resort industry we feel extremely confident in his ability to draw upon his past experience when making key decisions regarding resort operations risks climate change risks there has been an increasing amount of evidence that the emission of greenhouse gases is contributing to global warming and irregular climate change a core part of intrawests business relies on participating in future weather conditions warm weather could result in rain melting snow and inadequate snowfall which may affect the seasonal operations of a resort obviously without snow customers will not be able to ski or snowboard thus rendering intrawests services as useless conversely having weather that is too cold or extreme may also affect business at the mountain resorts as it may make access to the resort and lift operations more difficult seasonality risks intrawest wholly owns and operates six fourseason mountain resorts however a significant amount of revenue is derived from their second and third fiscal quarters during peak ski season due to optimal weather conditions because of the seasonality of their business some of the mountain resorts and cmh could experience operating losses or insignificant profits during the first and fourth fiscal quarters this is because of warmer weather that occurs during those quarters that alter the ability to ski in addition to lack of business towards intrawest summer amenities operating leverage risks the industry in which intrawest operates in has extremely high fixed costs with little variable costs and is capital intensive as equipment and property must always be operated maintained and eventually restored intrawest regularly has to spend on its fixed costs which include the construction maintenance and renovation of its equipment and property in order to operate and remain competitive and safe with global competitors and regulations respectively however these capital expenditures can be costly and unpredictable in nature due to forces outside of the companys control high fixed costs also pose high significant operating leverage risk in quarters with slow earnings because intrawest must still keep its resort operational which could cause major losses for the company the fixed costs and capital expenditures can include a variety of expenses such as operations of lifts facilities snowmobiles helicopters etc foreign exchange risks intrawest is exposed to currency fluctuation risk as a significant portion of their revenues and operating expenses are derived from their canadian operations during the fiscal  year  of the revenue earned by intrawest was denominated in canadian dollars the canadian operations that intrawest earn revenue from include blue mountain and mont tremblant resorts in addition to cmh volatile movements in the canadaus exchange rate could have a significant impact on net income after converting canadian operations into us dollars however canadiandominated operating expenses would naturally hedge any negative impact the exchange rate would have on revenue foreign exchange risk could also affect intrawest sales revenue at their canadian mountain resorts and cmh volatility in the exchange rate could impact the willingness international customers have of purchasing lift tickets or packages for example increase in the canadian dollar compared to the euro may make intrawests canadian attractions less attractive to european customers shareholder base liquidity market depth intrawest had their ipo on january st  at a price of  per share and is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under snow today they have  common shares outstanding the company has no restricted or preferred shares and no debt instruments other than a loan of  million the average threemonth trading volume for snow is approximately around  thousand shares a day which shows that the stock is generally liquid  of intrawest is owned by fortress investment group which is a diversified asset management company based out of new york fortress purchased all of intrawests stock in a leveraged buyout during august  at a price of b however because of the rise in demand for leisure activities fortress took intrawest public but still holds a majority stake in the company valuation trading comparable analysis for our trading comparable analysis it was difficult to find companies that we could compare against intrawest this is because the only public mountain resort operator in the united states and canada is vail resorts thus we included alternative businesses that provide customers with a service that they would use during their leisure time that are also seasonal this included companies such as six flags entertainment nysesix cedar fair nysefun club corp holdings and others we used these companies because we felt they provided us with a reasonable representation of the alternatives consumers had besides visiting a mountain resort during both winter and summer operations intrawests evebitda multiple of x could be seen as slightly undervalued compared to the comparable average of x providing an implied share price of  additionally intrawests pe ratio of x could also be looked at as overvalued compared against the comparable average of x which gave us an implied share price of  due to the similar environment and consumer of the comparable companies we feel that they still provide a reasonable valuation of intrawest we therefore decided to place a total of  weighting on our comparable analysis utilizing our average evebitda multiple discounted cash flow analysis for most of our analysis we assumed consistent operating conditions that have happened historically this is because of the competitive nature of the industry in addition to the uncertainty of what the threat of climate change will do to the business however because of intrawests investment into their summer operations we assumed steady longterm growth for intrawest assumptions revenues for the current year we forecasted an increase in revenue as we expect the number of visitors to increase due to positive weather conditions however because we factored in a number of risks into our revenue analysis such as competition climate change and the overall seasonality of the business we assumed that intrawests revenue will experience future volatility furthermore we believe that intrawests management will increase their investment into both winter and summer operations which will help them adapt to unpredictable weather conditions and competition this will start increasing revenue  to  operating margin we expect intrawests operating margin to decrease at a slow rate from  to  of revenue from  to  respectively for the current season we assumed an operation margin of  due to positive weather conditions as the industry is typically faced with high fixed costs we assume that the companies within it will find ways to become more cost effective in order increase their margins we believe this will be done through investment into renewable energy sources which will reduce intrawests carbon footprint and overall operating expenses depreciation and amortization because the industry has a high rate of capital intensity we expected depreciation and amortization to increase as the company continues to grow as intrawest will have to make further expenditures on new operating machinery their depreciation and amortization expense will increase alongside this growth taxes although intrawest does defer their tax payments we assumed a flat tax rate of  which is equivalent to their statutory rate capital expenditures as competition within the industry increases intrawest will have to increase their spending on capital expenditures this will include upgrades to lifts facilities snowmobiles helicopters and other assets that may be used when operating a mountain resort intrawest will also have to purchase new snowmaking machines and renewable energy resources in the future to deal with climate change and unpredictable weather conditions weighted average cost of capital otcwacc to determine intrawests cost of debt we used the interest rate they currently have on their longterm debt which is  which we found on bloomberg we also used intrawests last statutory tax rate of  to calculate their cost of equity we used a market risk premium of  next we used the risk free rate of  which can be found on a year us government bond as of february th  finally we used a ltm beta of  which was found on bloomberg using all these numbers within our calculation we calculated a wacc of  conclusion our discounted cash flow analysis generated an implied share price of share we believe that we used conservative and realistic assumptions going into the future due to the competitive and uncertain nature of the industry it is unlikely that intrawest will deviate from their current course of business and therefore think the valuation provides us with a reasonable intrinsic value weighted price target because intrawest operates in a volatile and highly competitive industry we felt that taking a slightly more intrinsic approach when valuing intrawest will provide us with a more reasonable share price we also believe there has been a sharp increase in the value of intrawest stock by  in january  this could be because of a variety of reasons which include recent weather conditions and deal rumors for this reason we decided to weight our implied share price of share calculated from our discounted cash flow and our evebitda implied share price of share from our comparable model  and  respectively this gave us a share price of  conclusion  recommendation overall intrawest is a stable company with successful winter operations from their mountain and adventure segments however the company continues to deliver inconsistent earnings during their summer operations if intrawest can successfully implement a successful summer business they will have the opportunity to possibly achieve consistent earnings throughout the year and in turn increase the value of their stock nevertheless this could prove to be difficult for intrawest as the summer is a highly competitive space with many substitutes we can expect management to continue their investment into growing their summer operations by increasing the amount of off season amenities at their resorts however in order to successfully implement a strong summer business management will need to think outside of the box and produce attractive amenities in order to provide customers with a reason to travel to intrawest resorts during the off season if the value of the stock were to decrease we feel that intrawest could prove to be a buying opportunity due to their strong winter business though we feel this highly reliant on future weather conditions and if intrawest can continue to geographically diversify themselves through acquisitions and invest in their snowmaking capabilities however based on our current assumptions we do feel that the market is pricing the stock fairly and therefore decided to place a hold rating at a target price of  for intrawest resort holdings appendix  income statement appendix

suitable sites the difficulty in obtaining necessary government permits and the significant capital required for development and construction as such no major ski resorts have been developed in the past  years with the last major resorts opened being blackcomb mountain and beaver creek in  and deer valley in  competition within the ski resort industry is based on multiple factors including location price weather conditions the uniqueness and perceived quality of the terrain for various levels of skill and ability the atmosphere of the base village the quality of food and entertainment and ease of travel to the resort including direct flights by major airlines we believe we compete effectively and our competitive position is protected due to the unique attributes and geographic diversity among our portfolio of mountain resorts we believe that our mountain resorts feature a sufficient quality and variety of terrain and activities to make them highly competitive with other mountain resorts our resorts directly compete with other mountain resorts in their respective local and regional markets as well as with other major destination resorts our individual mountain resorts primarily compete as follows • steamboat’s primary competition is from breckenridge ski resort in colorado park city mountain resort in utah and other large international ski destinations • winter park’s primary competition is from copper mountain resort keystone resort and other ski resorts located in colorado’s front range • tremblant’s primary competition is from montsainteanne mont blanc le massif and mont saintsauveur all located in quebec other resorts in the laurentian mountains and both jay peak and stowe mountain in northern vermont • stratton’s primary competition is from other midtolarge size ski resorts in southern vermont including okemo mount snow and killington resort • snowshoe’s primary competition is from ski resorts in the midatlantic such as seven springs mountain resort located in pennsylvania and bryce resort and wintergreen resort both located in virginia • blue mountain’s primary competition is from horseshoe valley resort and mount st louis both located in ontario and holiday valley resort in western new york  cmh directly competes with other heliskiing and snowcat operations in canada and the united states we believe that there are currently less than  heliskiing and catskiing operators in north america with most heliskiing and catskiing occurring in british columbia due to the vast alpine wilderness and consistent annual snowfall cmh also competes to a lesser extent with liftaccessed ski resorts in north america and other parts of the world  we compete with other vacation club and fractional ownership businesses in our efforts to sell points memberships in club intrawest in addition we compete with other property management companies in providing management services at ihm’s properties our managed properties compete with rental management companies locally owned independent hotels as well as facilities and timeshare companies that are owned or managed by national and international chains these properties also compete for convention and conference business across the north american market competition within the hotel and lodging industry is generally based on quality and consistency of rooms restaurants and meeting facilities and services attractiveness of locations availability of a global distribution system price and other factors company description we are a north american mountain resort and adventure company delivering distinctive vacation and travel experiences to our customers for over three decades we own interests in seven fourseason mountain resorts with more than  skiable acres and more than  acres of land available for real estate development our mountain resorts are geographically diversified across north america’s major ski regions including the eastern united states the rocky mountains the pacific southwest and canada which we believe helps reduce our financial exposure to any single geographic area as weather patterns and economic conditions vary across these regions our mountain resorts are

denver los angeles montreal and toronto during fiscal  our portfolio of resorts received more than six million visitors from all  states and more than  countries we also operate an adventure travel business the cornerstone of which is canadian mountain holidays “cmh” the leading heliskiing adventure company in north america cmh provides helicopter accessed skiing mountaineering and hiking to

club properties manage condominium hotel properties and sell and market residential real estate we operate within the leisure industry with a business that benefits from improvements in the economy and associated increases in consumer discretionary spending numerous economic trends support the notion that the health of the general economy is continuing to improve as the economy continues to improve we believe that consumers will have more disposable income and a greater inclination to engage in and spend on leisure activities we also expect recreational adventure and experiential travel to continue to gain in popularity as individuals including the important “baby boomer” generation live longer healthier lives we intend to capitalize on these favorable trends within the leisure industry to drive growth within our business by increasing visitation at our resorts and at cmh increasing product pricing and growing the scale of our businesses through targeted growth capital investments and acquisitions we evaluate acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally where the opportunity would provide a strategic fit within our existing portfolio of businesses
