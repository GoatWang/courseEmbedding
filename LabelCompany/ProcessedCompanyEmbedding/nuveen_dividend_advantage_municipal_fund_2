surviving funds investment strategy change each surviving fund will reposition its portfolio to achieve and consistently maintain a higher allocation to municipal securities rated bbb  below     ●   each fund may invest up to  of its portfolio in municipal securities rated bbb and below it is expected that when each fund completes its portfolio repositioning given current market conditions approximately  of each surviving funds portfolio will be allocated to municipal securities rated bbb and below   nuveen municipal bond closedend funds qa  august     page       ●   each surviving fund expects to consistently maintain a higher proportion of its portfolio invested in municipal securities rated bbb and below but each funds actual allocation to such municipal securities may vary over time     ●   for nvg  of the funds portfolio also will be invested in securities that are exempt from the alternative minimum tax amt at the time of investment these changes are anticipated to increase each funds potential net earnings and will also increase credit risk relative to historical levels as of july   the combined investment exposure including tender option bond obligations of the surviving funds nzf and nvg allocated to municipal securities rated bbb and below was  and  respectively both funds would continue to employ leverage in accordance with current leverage policies what are the potential benefits of each proposal to me as a fund common shareholder these proposed actions are expected to offer a number of potential benefits to fund shareholders including     ●   meaningfully higher fund net earnings that may support higher common share distributions   ●   increased competitiveness and investor appeal which may enhance the funds secondary market trading prices relative to net asset value   ●   increased portfolio and leverage management flexibility due to a significantly larger asset base   ●   greater liquidity and ease of trading due to a larger common share float   ●   lower fund administrative costs excluding the costs of leverage as certain fixed costs are spread over a larger asset base will my funds dividend change as has been the case in prior nuveen municipal closedend fund mergers distribution amounts immediately following each merger are anticipated to be at least equal to pre merger levels on a common share equivalent basis each surviving fund anticipates that its net earnings may increase over time as a result of repositioning its portfolio which would support higher common share distributions what is nuveens outlook on lowerrated municipal bonds in the current market environment nuveen asset management nam the funds subadviser believes that lowerrated municipal bonds represent attractive longterm investments and that fundamentals remain strong in the current market environment in several public communications nam has noted its reasons including     ●   high yield municipal bond yields and spreads remain attractive     ●   high yield defaults have declined to precrisis levels and nam expects that an improving economic environment will continue to benefit this trend     ●   high yield municipal bonds have historically responded favorably to a rising interest rate environment   nuveen municipal bond closedend funds qa  august     page     for a more detailed discussion please see nams commentary on high yield and its high yield municipal bond investor presentation lowerrated municipal bonds may be more likely to fail to make dividend or interest payments when due may be less liquid and are subject to greater volatility and risk of default how large are the surviving funds expected to be as of  the total investment exposure including tender option bond obligations of the surviving funds nzf and nvg and their proposed constituents was approximately  billion and  billion respectively will the surviving funds be able to find enough attractive lowerrated municipal securities in the current market environment we believe so as one of the largest and most experienced managers of municipal credit nam believes there are attractive opportunities in both new issue and secondary markets will the surviving funds invest in any puerto rico bonds at this time the combined assets of each surviving fund have less than  exposure to puerto rico municipal bonds and that exposure is fully insured the mergers and investment policy changes will not affect whether the funds subadviser believes investments in puerto rico bonds are attractive or not nam has published numerous updates over the past year about its view of puerto rico bonds and any future updates will be found on nams municipal bond resource center how long will it take the surviving funds to reposition their portfolios the transition process will depend on a number of market factors including new issue and secondary market supply of municipal bonds consequently it is not possible to provide an estimated timeframe for each funds transition at this time the four funds that are proposed to combine into nvg have amteligible income ranging from  to  of each funds total income if fund shareholders approve the proposals the funds will transition their portfolios to be completely amtfree prior to closing how will fund expense ratios be affected for the nzf merger expense ratios excluding the cost of leverage are projected to be  to  basis points lower in the first year following the merger and thereafter from  to  basis points higher depending on the original fund for the nvg merger expense ratios excluding the cost of leverage are projected to be  basis points lower to  basis points higher in the first year following the merger and thereafter from  to  basis points higher depending on the original fund   nuveen municipal bond closedend funds qa  august     page     expense changes after the first year are due to the phasein of a  basis point higher management fee over the first year reflecting the increased level of ongoing credit research and surveillance required by the surviving funds expanded mandates the funds larger scale is expected to result in lower administrative fees which are anticipated to partially offset the higher management fees detailed fundbyfund comparisons will be available in proxy materials that will be sent to shareholders in the fall the surviving funds modestly higher expense ratios not including the costs of leverage are expected to be more than offset by meaningfully increased common share net earnings and distribution potential resulting from each funds expanded investment mandate will there be any taxable consequences from this proposal no each merger is intended to qualify as a taxfree reorganization for federal income tax purposes in addition we anticipate that repositioning the surviving funds portfolios will not result in any net realized gains what actions do i need to take at this time you do not need to do anything at this time more information on the proposed actions will be contained in the proxy materials expected to be filed in the coming weeks proxy materials should be distributed electronically or by mail once they have been finalized the funds engage a proxy solicitation firm  computershare fund services  to assist in soliciting the necessary votes in a timely manner if enough shareholders do not cast their votes a fund may not be able to hold its meeting and will be required to incur additional solicitation costs in order to obtain sufficient shareholder participation to reduce expense
