results and the progress we are making towards our growth strategies and theatrelevel initiatives to further enhance longterm shareholder value richard will then provide additional details regarding our q results and capital structure after which we will open the call to your questions carmikes strong operating and financial momentum continues in  as highlighted by our record second quarter performance across several key financial metrics including solid growth in all revenue sources adjusted ebitda and theatrelevel cash flow the ongoing success of our theatrelevel initiatives and the continued progress we are achieving in our valuebuilding theatre acquisition and organic growth strategies allowed us to leverage the healthy industry box office to generate alltime quarterly record operating revenues  million carmikes second quarter total operating revenue growth of  led to a  plus improvement in operating income resulting in the companys highest ever quarterly adjusted ebitda and theatrelevel cash flow which increased by over  and  respectively admissions revenue growth of  was significantly exceeded the industry average reflection of attendance increase of  in aggregate and approximately  on a per screen basis the per screen metric substantially in line with the industry as a reminder carmike materially outperformed this sector in yearoveryear growth by approximately  basis points each in both  and  a rather aggressive  basis point over indexing for the combined period we believe the yeartodate performance for carmike and the sector in general is a positive indication of the overall health of the movie business and reiterates what we and our industry peers believe that a compelling diverse and wellspaced slate of highquality studio film product combined with exhibitors uniquely immersive entertainment offerings including largescreen digital projection and premium amenities will drive strong and sustainable attendance by bringing customers unrivalled cinema going entertainment experiences notably carmikes ongoing success in generating consistent admissions and attendance increase reflects the benefit of our expanded scale through ongoing ma and organic growth initiatives as well as our companywide focus of providing bestinclass theatrelevel service similar to the first quarter of  the yearoveryear rise in our average screen count of  reflects several new build locations as well as the integration of screens acquired from digiplex in the second half of  carmike remains focused on advancing the guest experience by increasing our unique services and entertainment offerings in this regard we announced a new venture with fathom events in may to expand our alternative programming to  locations by early  more than half of all carmike locations we believe this will help us deliver new entertainment experiences and content options to our customers while also providing us with the potential to drive incremental attendance and revenue over the longterm during nonpeak box office periods carmike recently expanded our imax relationship with an agreement to add three new imax theatres one each in missoula and billings montana and a new development project to be announced soon the agreement brings the first commercial imax theatres to moviegoers in montana and increases carmike total imax commitment to  theatres our imax big d and d offerings bring customers more premium presentation choices and help generate revenue and attendance growth across our circuit carmikes record second quarter results also reflect strong growth in concessions and other revenue which rose  yearoveryear to an alltime quarterly mark in excess of  million the ongoing success in further development and innovation with food and beverage initiatives drove a  increase in concessions and other spending per patron to  carmikes record level concessions and other spending per patron marks the nd consecutive reporting period of yearoveryear growth in addition to our existing menu of snacks candy popcorn and soda we have a growing number of locations offering enhanced selections including hot foods such as pizza hot dogs and chicken tenders among other items as we mentioned previously the number of carmike locations offering beer wine and other adult beverages stands at roughly  dozen we have additional alcohol license applications pending approval with the goal of expanding this service to approximately half of our locations were very pleased with the results todate and are confident that these initiatives can continue to make positive contributions to our growth in revenue and earnings we recently launched our third ovation dinein complex in athens georgia our first two ovation dinein locations in bloomington illinois and richmond virginia opened during the first quarter customers are responding well to these new locations which feature special amenities including reserved seat a cocktail and dining lounge and a convenient inseat service button allowing guests to order from a menu of quality appetizers entrees desserts and beverages both before and during the movie our food and beverage diversification initiatives and intheatre dining strategies are focused on enhancing the overall moviegoing experience by creating a unique dining and entertainment environment where our customers may enjoy a full evening out of the home offcampus or base at an attractive value and from one convenient location from an industry perspective the box office is performing very well with yearoveryear domestic box office revenue increases over  quartertodate and nearly  yeartodate minions the prequel to the familyfriendly despicable me franchise achieved the best ever opening day and the second highest grossing opening weekend debut for an animated film in north america generating over  million in box office revenues quartertodate with many more promising film titles set for release including mission impossible  and fantastic four we fully expect the favorable box office environment to continue this quarter were also optimistic about the overall second half of  with many franchise films and exciting tadpoles on tap for q including star wars episode vii the james bond movie spectre the hunger games mockingjay part  and others as weve previously discussed we believe growing our footprint through selective acquisitions is one of the most effective ways to optimize our theatre operations and create additional shareholder value over the last three years weve completed the acquisition of approximately  theatres  screens representing more than  of todays total screen count these completed transactions brought further diversification and scale to our operations while delivering visible and quantifiable financial benefits for our company and its shareholders we continue to actively pursue opportunities and remain confident in our ability to further execute on additional value building transactions we have also been expanding organically both in existing and greenfield locations working with some of the nations leading commercial developers and reits and plan to continue on this path our new builds typically have between  and  screens with at least one premium large format screen we have a very strong balance sheet that includes over  million in cash and a recently refinanced capital structure our board management team and i remain confident in the companys prospects to further strategically expand the business by adding roughly  screens to our existing platform through acquisitions we believe our ma focused capital allocation strategy will deliver increased value and returns for our stakeholders and intend to remain one of the industrys top consolidators were pleased with our record operating performance for the first half our ability to execute against our theatrelevel initiatives and the continued success for the box office environment and remain optimistic that the positive operating environment will continue in the back half of  richard richard b hare thank you david ill start with the review of carmikes second quarter financial results after which ill provide an update on our capital structure for the second quarter we generated record quarterly total revenues of  million  higher than in q  including  million of admissions as well as  million in concession and other revenues we are pleased with our admissions revenue for the second quarter which grew  as attendance grew by  to over  million attendees were also pleased with our average ticket price of  a  increase compared to the year ago period we also enjoyed a very healthy performance across our concession segment this concession and other revenue increased  yearoveryear with concessions and other revenue per patron spend growing  to  our highest quarterly concession and other revenue per cap in the companys history these results reflect the ongoing focus and high level of success we are achieving in our concessions initiatives including the enhancement and refinement of our food menu and beverage offerings and our ability to implement modest price increases the combination of both healthy admissions and concession spend led to total second quarter per patron spend of  an alltime quarterly record and a  increase from  per patron in the second quarter of  turning our attention to costs the largest of our cost inputs film exhibition cost rose to  million representing  of admissions revenue an increase of  basis points compared to the same period last year the increase was due to significant increase in the box office concentration of topperforming titles as a reminder film rent trends to be higher during periods where topperforming titles represent a larger percentage of the total box office and this was certainly the case in the second quarter as the top five films represented over  of the industrys box office in q  and the top five titles represented only  of the industry box office in q  concession cost as a percentage of concessions and other revenue decreased by  basis points from  in the second quarter of  to  in the second quarter of  the yearoveryear decline is primarily attributable to lower supply costs our theatrelevel expense categories increased during the quarter primarily resulting from our expanded circuit following recent acquisitions and new buildtosuit theatre openings salaries and benefits rose  million to  million but declined as a percentage of total operating revenues to  versus  a year ago theatre occupancy cost increased  million to  million in q  while other theatre operating costs increased  million to  million in q  our operating leverage was clearly demonstrated in the second quarter of  as our three primary operating expense categories as a percentage of total operating revenues was  a decrease of  basis points over the prior year as a result second quarter operating income rose  to  million compared to  million in the year ago period operating income margin improved  basis points to  compared to the year ago period general and administrative expenses were  million which included a  million of noncash sharebased compensation and  million of merger and acquisition related costs depreciation and amortization expense was  million which reflects the increased circuit size following our acquisition of digiplex in  quarterly interest expense in  decreased to  million as a result of slightly lower balances in capital leases and financing obligations following the refinancing of our senior secured notes in june of  interest expense is expected to approximate  million on an annual basis in addition we recorded a  million gain on the sale of property and equipment recognized an approximate  impairment charge on longlived assets and recorded income of  from unconsolidated affiliates with the majority attributable to our profits interest in screenvision as a result of our recent debt financing we incurred  million of debt extinguishment costs related to the termination of our  million  senior secured notes due  including a prepayment premium of  million the refinancing has afforded us both a maturity extension as well as a slight increase in borrowing capacity and is expected to yield approximately  million of annual interest expense savings through  we recorded an income tax benefit of  million during the second quarter of  due primarily to our debt extinguishment charges we recorded income tax expense of  million in the second quarter of  combined these factors led to a net loss of  million or a loss of  per share on a diluted basis for the second quarter this compares to net income of  million or  per diluted share in the second quarter of  eliminating debt extinguishment costs and other onetime expenses on an adjusted basis we generated net income of  million or  per diluted share theatrelevel cash flow rose  to  million and adjusted ebitda expanded  to  million yeartodate carmike generated theatrelevel cash flow and adjusted ebitda of  million and  million respectively reflecting the success of our initiatives and an overall health of our business reconciliations of these two nongaap measures are provided in todays press release which is also posted on our website turning to our balance sheet carmike had cash and cash equivalents of  million at june   as second quarter cap expenditures were  million primarily related to the recently constructed buildtosuit theatres the conversion of certain traditional theatres to our casual intheatre dining concept and theatre renovations our full year  capex guidance of approximately  million remains unchanged and we continue to expect they will be approximately equally divided across new build projects fullservice casual dining theatres remodels including premium large format auditorium construction and maintenance capex and it expenditures as it relates to new builds during the first six months of the year we opened two new theatres with a total of  screens we also completed the renovation of a third theatre to include our ovation dinein concept going forward we anticipate opening up four new buildtosuit theatres during the balance of  and intend to include one large format auditorium in each of our new buildtosuit theatres in june of  we completed refinancing of our  million  senior secured notes that were due in  we replaced these notes with  million  senior secured notes maturing in  in conjunction with the issuance of the  million senior secured notes we entered into a  million revolving credit facility which replaced our  million revolving credit facility reflecting cash of  million at june   in our recent refinancing we ended the second quarter with  million of net debt compared with  million at december   in total debt outstanding including the capital leases and longterm financing obligations plus our senior notes due  was  million for covenant reporting purposes gross leverage was approximately x and net leverage was approximately x on a trailing month basis at the end of june  in summary our attention continues to focus on expanding our theatre circuit through accretive acquisitions and new locations through buildtosuit arrangements our improving operating metrics including growth in adjusted ebitda demonstrate our recent success with this strategy and we believe that our current capital structure has positioned us well for the future with that id like to open the call up for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from the line of david miller with topeka capital markets please proceed david miller i probably speak for most of the folks on this call buy side or sell side when i say that the overall bullish thesis on you guys is and has always been that youll continue to kind of clock it on perhaps with regard to dining per caps that youll always outperform the general market or at least meet it like you did in the second quarter but cost just seemed to be an issue two out of four quarters on average this time it was rents which was inexorably high and then other theatre opex im just wondering why there wasnt more operating leverage on the other theatre opex category just given your higher screen count i would have thought you guys would have been able to kind of smooth that out a little bit more given that you guys have  or so more screens than you did last year and then i have a followup thanks richard b hare david let me address those two points on film rent there was certainly a larger concentration this quarter of topperforming titles generating more box office than the previous year and we expect there to be pressure on film this year with the slate performing the way it is but the second quarters concentration was very high and as you know weve had these scale ranges in place for a very long time and so when the box office generates these record levels these scale agreements come into play and our film rate is somewhat higher and there certainly was pressure on that metric in the second quarter with regard to theatre cost itself if you look at where we ended up if you combine all of the three components of theatre cost we started out last year baseline around  million and then we got digiplex runs about  million a quarter and new builds are about  million a quarter so you kind of bake in around  million or so as a normalized run rate and quite frankly the d as a percentage of the box office was up to around  and it was fairly – excuse me our premium box office was around  so that includes d and imax and big d et cetera and last year it was only around  so we had not  million but it was close to it and additional large screen format type experiences that we would expect to pay and then the rest of the balance is just going to be increased salaries as it relates to higher attendance and a little bit more in repair costs so we did see some significant improvement in our operating leverage and our ebitda margins and we expect to continue to see that on a going forward basis this year with this type of box office david miller so film exhibition cost at close to  is that generally a pattern that we should model for the third and fourth quarters in your opinion richard b hare in my opinion i would expect to see more pressure on that line item but i dont think based on what im reading about the third quarter and the projections out there for movies i dont think that concentration will be as concentrated in the third quarter as it was in the second quarter and in the fourth quarter it might be a little bit more pressure but this second quarter was – these concentration levels were very high and we certainly havent seen anything like that in the past david miller okay and then final question are you guys spending any dollars that youre expensing on the old muvico and digiplex assets now on certain categories that will moderate in the next say two three four quarters any categories that should soften with regard to getting those assets up to snuff up to your standards richard b hare no i would just say we baked in  million of total capex for the year and we feel comfortable with that and the normal repair and maintenance i wouldnt expect anything unusual for digiplex or muvico or the circuit in general david miller all right thank you very much operator our next question is from james marsh with piper jaffray please proceed james marsh i guess i just want to followup on that film rental question and just get your sense on whether this is just a cyclical issue or a secular issue because it seems like the studios want to focus on fewer bigger films which would hit the tops of the scales that you talked about there richard so obviously theyre going to continue to move in that direction maybe it starts to shift towards just the bigger films doing bigger box office and your numbers just stay sustainably higher up there whats your take on that richard b hare i would just say if you go back and look at the titles in the second quarter and how jurassic world avengers fast  furious and to a lesser degree inside out and pitch perfect performed and look at how captain america transformers indiscernible and xmen last year did we expect to see an increase in film rent during the year but in the second quarter you had more but if you look back at it im trying to pull my numbers to see how these specific ones did but the gross box office for jurassic world is over  million avengers was over  million and fast  furious was over  million and last year you didnt have any over  million so thats just a function of the math on the scale deals i would expect us to continue to see some pressure on that line item during the year but i wouldnt expect it to be to that level in the third quarter s david passman iii let me just add just a tad to that james the number one film for the second quarter  did twice did  of what the number one film did in  that  million movie in most of these major studios with their major tadpoles are of scale deals which weve discussed many times in the past but as the movie does better particularly when its a  million movie or like avengers which was  million movie film rent goes up it goes up proportionate to the amount that the movie does last year if you just compare in the second quarter i believe that the highest grossing film for the entire second quarter last year was  million avengers or captain america im sorry and this year the top three films were over  million each and that is going to bring with it some higher film rent just because of the scale and i guess we cry all the way to the bank when its all said and done james marsh yes i guess my question is really is this what the studios are trying to do are they doing fewer bigger films and your model just changes now and maybe you need to start looking at either having an equity interest in those films like open road or focusing more on concession growth just share with the studios but it would seem to me thats more of a secular nature and you guys should have a plan to kind of get around it s david passman iii i guess thats certainly an avenue worth talking about but i dare say open road didnt got to have a  million movie and it spreads by having more movie product available which by the way there are several new studios that are trying to fill that gap where some of these major studios have abandoned the middle market and in favor of the very very large tadpole movies i think what youre suggesting is the more product we have the lower the average film rent is going to be because the less or the greater the percentage of movies that wont be in that  million and  million event and again we are not complaining about three movies doing in excess of  million this quarter were actually quite pleased that we had three movies to that kind of volume a heck of a lot better than a year ago even with higher film rent james marsh yes but theres no operating leverage thats the problem as you get to  revenue growth and you did  ebitda growth and one of the big factors was you paid  last year and you paid  film rental this year so i wouldnt be saying you laughed all the way to the bank id like to see more operating leverage but anyway ill let the next question in the queue go but thank you guys operator our next question is from eric wold with b riley please proceed eric wold a couple of questions one kind of followup on margin but just more so kind of thinking other than film rent which is i guess somewhat out of your control kind of with the line items that you can control your field of operating expenses ga kind of what is your target margin over the coming year ph just where youre going to get more leverage out of that from the lines you can control more effectively richard b hare id say on the ga side typically thats kind of flat it runs around  million when you back up the ma and the stockbased comp expense and thats kind of historical and then if you look at our other cost and our theatre cost were kind of where we thought they would be we had a little bit incremental expenses related to the large screen format screens but thats just part of the – we got the revenue pickup on that so we had a little bit slightly more maybe  or so more of salary expense yearoveryear but we had a lot more attendance as well so we were pleased with the  adjusted ebitda margins we were up last quarter as well and we would expect them to continue to improve during the year with this kind of box office eric wold okay now on the acquisition front i know youre gradually looking for targets it obviously takes willing sellers to get a transaction done how willing would you characterize the seller market right now can you talk about any of your discussions as being on the go line and then lastly were you considering starplex ahead of amc making that acquisition s david passman iii with regard to where were at in discussions with folks we cant comment as to where or how close to the go line we are we just make it a practice not to comment on pending discussions but i will say we are actively discussing with a number of sellers and i think if you take a look at sellers motivations they would have the same motivations today they had six months ago and that is as the big circuits get bigger the smaller circuits by definition as a percentage of the total are getting smaller and thats a little disconcerting to them we really believe that they are looking to avoid another round of investment on additional amenities or technology upgrades or those type things and when we look at our industry i think i said in my prepared remarks that we believe we can expand another  screens with current capital structure that we have and cash available if you take a look at the industry youve heard me say this a gazillion times the top four circuits control  of the us screen count the next  exhibitors own between  and  screens were looking to acquire about  we really dont believe that thats an overly aggressive goal to shoot for in the foreseeable future it does require patience it does require tenacity in these discussions but they will occur i think most recent case in point was the starplex announcement good looking circuit nearly three dozen locations i think  of those are firstrun theatres and for amc with what it was looking to do we applaud them on the acquisition were not going to discuss where we were at in that process but we think it like many of the regional circuits its available and it will transact eric wold perfect thank you operator we have a question from jeff logsdon with jbl advisors please proceed jeffrey logsdon i wont beat the dead horse again but ill ask it a little bit differently is anybody at any film level of revenue getting more than  in film rentals s david passman iii jeff thats a difficult question for us to answer because were not privy to what everybody else pays for film rent thats on an individual theatre by theatre and studio by studio discussion or negotiation so i really couldnt as we guessed on… jeffrey logsdon and can we just turn that towards you guys are there any films that are getting more than  rentals this past quarter you dont have to identify the film but indiscernible s david passman iii unfortunately jeff we dont discuss or disclose what individual films cost us and we really dont want to start now jeffrey logsdon okay alright thats fair is there a percentage of your workforce that is at the minimum wage level and will any changes that are on that is that going to change the ga cost much i mean obviously indiscernible s david passman iii yes – im sorry i didnt mean to interrupt you jeffrey logsdon no its okay s david passman iii we employ about  folks  or so percentage of those are high school and college or retired folks and the lions share of those more than  of those are paid beginning wages at minimum so depending on what state were in or whether they are under the federal rules weve got a very large percentage that would be at the minimum wage and we have gone through and taken a look at and tried to postulate on what minimum wage laws are going to look like in the future i think i would just say that we adjust our cost structure as necessary for government regulations and we adjust our pricing to compensate for that or to makeup for any of that increased cost jeffrey logsdon same question then really around healthcare and healthcare costs richard b hare the healthcare cost we kind of implemented it already and its been very minimal on carmike so thats everything that everybody is – the whole industry its not just us has kind of incorporated and made adjustments in how we manage hours and people and we dont think its a significant impact on us jeffrey logsdon just lastly if you can talk about screenvision the advertising environment and now that they will remain independent how we should view that investment going forward s david passman iii i think ive said on the last couple of calls after the ncmscreenvision transaction was terminated that screenvision is keeping on business as usual but during the period that it was in limbo while the justice department was reviewing the transaction they lost some key employees and we are for lack of a better term in a rebuilding mode as we speak and i use the term we only because i serve on the board of directors of screenvision carmike does not actively manage any of the operations for screenvision or with screenvision we are in a search have an excellent search firm working to find a new ceo and the candidate pool that we have and ive interviewed several of the candidates for that is nothing short of outstanding i expect that in the very near term screenvision will be announcing the hiring of a ceo and that will be followed pretty quickly by some key sales and other positions particularly the revenue position or chief revenue officer screenvision is alive and well its doing just fine the advertising market is a pretty good one right now as you would expect with the great slate that we have for  and expected for  so were only expecting improvements in the future with screenvision operator we have a question from jim goss with barrington research please proceed jim goss first the slight decline in theatres and screens in the latest quarter was that just the way the lease renewals happen to work out or is that the sort of organic trend youd expect potentially offset by whatever acquisitions you are able to make richard b hare they were just basically our normal theatre closures nothing out of the ordinary there i think we closed three locations  screens jim goss okay and in terms of the notion that some of your acquisitions could be occurring in the second half is there any sense that there was some rather sense to do any deals in the first half because of the huge movies coming out and that were getting to the stage where that might not be as much of an issue going forward s david passman iii ill defer to other peers in the industry jim but from carmikes perspective we were as active in discussions and negotiations in the first quarter this year as we were in any quarter in the last eight quarters jim goss okay so its still just a matter of when things happen s david passman iii yes i wish we could control that piece of the equation but unfortunately with every transaction there is a buyer and a seller and we only represent one of those parties jim goss okay regarding your pos strategy i think you did shift a couple of the big ds to imax and im wondering whats your strategy is there going forward and are you thinking that youll eventually roll through a pretty high share of your existing platform to put in a pos screen if it doesnt exist in the existing infrastructure s david passman iii with regard to the imax relationship that was a twoparty agreement and imax had targeted several of our markets in the past and when we inherited the relationship i believe with our first rave acquisition we began discussing with them what their strategy was across the us in what markets and they identified several markets where carmike had existing largeformat screens and as we negotiated for what now has become  separate imax locations there were some give and take in various markets in some we converted from a big d to an imax screen and in some we added a big d to an imax and in others we simply are doing new builds with an imax in desired markets for them suffice it to say that all things being equal in any particular market if we have an opportunity for an imax screen we are going to take it very very seriously because it is indisputable that imax draws foot traffic it increases attendance and if youre going to be in a market that would support an imax screen the chances are there will be a competitor in that market and we would certainly prefer to have it be carmike that gets that additional foot traffic jim goss alright thats a great endorsement and then lastly related to fathom i was wondering what the terms are of your expanded agreement with them i noticed one of your existing theatres had carmike classic movies or carmike classic films which struck me as the same sort of thing cinemark has been doing so i imagine its a similar program so how does that work in terms of your relationship economically speaking and if you might add to that the alternative content share of total where that stands these days s david passman iii the classics that were doing are proprietary they are not normally with the fathom events but we are looking to have a fairly large number of fathom events particularly in  as we get these things rolled out but the metropolitan opera and things like that that fathom does exclusive we really want to participate in so that kind of gave rise to the fathom agreement the classics and other alternative programming and content that were doing were hoping to have rolled out in at least that many theatres as well and i think in the second quarter were still tethering in the  to  of box office so these are still the early days for alternative programming but were quite optimistic and very bullish on what it will look like jim goss alright thanks very much operator our next question is from chad beynon with macquarie please proceed chad beynon first one i have with respect to accretive acquisitions your equity is now trading at ev multiples that we havent seen in a few years on the back of some industryspecific concerns and obviously the overall market pullback so with that in mind how do you think about different ways of capital allocation if the ma market isnt as opportunistic as you see it now with respect to buybacks s david passman iii we went through a lot of trouble to issue equity and get cash on our balance sheet so that we could pursue acquisitions were not ready to throw in the towel on ma and i think as i said a little earlier we see  screens as a reasonable realistic and timely target so if that changes well certainly consider things like dividends or stock buyback but we really dont expect that to change chad beynon okay thank you next question i had is with respect to just kind of the overall moviegoer audience in light of a very high attendance quarter so i guess firstly did you see a significant increase in your new rewards members and what im getting at are you seeing the same people coming back and watching jurassic park and avengers multiple times or you getting people getting off their couches who havent come to the theatre in a long time and then maybe if you could add onto that what youre seeing with kind of the teenage group given that the summer is a critically important time s david passman iii unfortunately and im embarrassed to say this but unfortunately we dont know an awful lot about the customers that are not reward customers as you know with the privacy rules were not allowed to capture information except for those who are willing to share it with us and i dare say more dont share than do having said that yes we are happy with what we see in terms of repeat business and i would say that avid moviegoers are the primary driver of our attendance in basically all of  but the teens and the tweens were terrific for jurassic park and inside out i believe were going to see a lot of people between your age and mine at mission impossible  and then revert back to the  to  year old for most of the rest of the movies this year man from uncle im a little uncertain as to whether those are going to be all my age group or between yours and mine for those who remember man from uncle but i really cant do anything more than speculate as to who is coming thats driving the increased attendance i can tell you though that we get on our facebook page and website an awful lot of folks who say theyve seen it more than one time and i think that was just because of the quality of the movie and they wanted to share with friends and family chad beynon okay and the last one if i may richard you mentioned that these scale agreements have been in place with the studios for some time is there an opportunity to renegotiate these just given that carmike of today is significantly different from a quality and size standpoint from maybe what the company looked like when these negotiations were put in place richard b hare these conversations are confidential between carmike and the studios the reason i really wanted to prefix my remarks by saying theyve been in place for some time there were some media reports earlier in the year that indicated that some exhibitors had changed their scale agreements and i wanted you and the market to know that these have been in place over a long period of time chad beynon okay appreciate it thank you operator our next question is from mike hickey with the benchmark company please proceed michael hickey pretty deep in the queue here forgive me if these have been asked in part but obviously a few of us here are looking at  and it appears on the surface at least a more difficult environment for the markets to grow and so curious of how you guys are thinking about your cost side your fixed expense into that environment as you look forward in terms of where you can reduce some of your fixed costs that would be helpful thank you richard b hare let me start with our cost structure and then if david wants to supplement with anything about the  slate we dont foresee any changes in our – lets talk about our cost structure in two categories on the ga side and then theatre cost side our ga side has been running at a normalized run rate around  million for some time now it has not increased as a result of our circuit increasing so we feel confident and pretty comfortable where we are with regard to ga cost then if you look at our theatre cost the theatre cost has basically been running at these levels since weve expanded the circuit and what i mean by that is you just take our baseline and you add the additional digiplex fixed costs and our new build fixed cost thats basically it youve got a few other variances but nothing substantial so we dont see the cost structure in our business or in other exhibitors business changing significantly its a highly fixed cost environment around  to  of our costs are fixed and we can take cost in salaries or other areas we certainly will do that to be more efficient but we feel very confident about our structure s david passman iii mike in terms of the slate for  i mean we need to all temper our thinking here a bit if  ends up at what most of you on this call are predicting to be at  billion or possibly even  billion year an historic high i dont think its realistic to assume that that is a growth rate in overall box office that is going to straightline into infinity if we retract in  as an industry all the way back to  and only do  billion thats still going to be a pretty darker year and right now i dont think thats an unrealistic possibility for  if you take a look at the movies that are slated for  through basically  there are going to be some great movie years ahead of us so i think what that says is that we have a fairly consistent fairly predictable within a range of several hundred basis points good strong moviegoing attendance and box office that we can make decent profits on the way that carmike – and we dont see our ebitda margin improving dramatically over what its going to be this year the way for us to improve the ebitda dollars the net margin dollars is through ma activities and that why we believe that our strategy is a good one and making acquisitions and getting ebitda growth dollar growth through ma activities rather than through costcutting or unrealistic expectations about box office increases does that make sense michael hickey yes david thanks i appreciate it theres obviously a backdrop in my next question with the recent executive turnover at one of your competitors and i ask this with the utmost respect but i was hoping david you could take a moment to reset with us your passion to continue to run the business obviously you and your team have created tremendous shareholder value its been an incredible turnaround but now perhaps the environment is finally more difficult to perhaps the challenges that youll face for continued growth of change so your thoughts there would be wonderful s david passman iii you bet ill start with the conclusion i dont plan on going anywhere im having the time of my life and i think the more challenges we have in our industry although at times they are very very difficult the more opportunities there are in our industry mike i dont think you were following us back in  when i first came onboard fulltime but our concessions per cap were under  as i recall if they werent under  they were right around  and today in this quarter they were  a dramatic improvement to our operating cash flow and the thing that we can control which is consumer spending money at our concession stand and the profit that we get from that movie slate is going to change year in and year out there will be some good years and some bad years but even the bad years are still going to be tolerable and able to provide enough revenue for us at the box office to be able to make good returns for our shareholders and i really look forward to the things the innovation that were working on the dinein concept that weve got the alternative programming and of course ma which is kind of a treat that ive had for the last couple of decades that i just love doing ma ma that makes sense of course but i love doing ma and i see that in our foreseeable future michael hickey thank you david good luck guys operator we have a question from leo kulp with rbc capital markets please proceed leo kulp just on the potential seller side it sounds to us like some of the equipment manufacturers cd manufacturers in particular are now offering financing to smaller circuits to help fund upgrades for premium offerings do you see that dampening the need for smaller circuits to sell and then also on the ma side if the box office is down  to  is that going to change the desire of sellers to potentially sell s david passman iii i think the answer to both of those questions is the same actually and they are very directly related getting financing is one thing having to repay the loans is another thing and what you have to guarantee in some cases and whether its recourse or nonrecourse in some cases is a big big question for an independent theatre indiscernible when our industry six years or seven years ago began converting to digital projection financing wasnt all that difficult to obtain what was difficult to obtain was nonrecourse financing and those projectors were not cheap and many independent exhibitors had to borrow money and put mortgages on their homes or guarantee loans for the down payment on those projectors and for an independent who had never previously had to guarantee loans that was a big deal i see seating i see the challenges of the future all of that stuff for independents as being more difficult than even when they converted to projection so all the amenities that we are adding out of cash flow for reseating or for dinein conversions were able to do without having to increase our debt capacity and a lot of these regional guys now having to take previously spendable profits and pour that back into their businesses so i would say that now is a good time from a sellers perspective to be in teams of people like carmike about exiting the industry while its got a great indiscernible leo kulp okay and then do you think if the box office is down  to  does that sort of flow through on the ebitda line drive incremental sellers or shouldnt have a lot of impact s david passman iii i think its the same kind of thing that a down box office – a seller of course always wants to sell at the peak any time you have a home and you want to upgrade to a new home you want to try to sell at the peak and buy at the low as the industry may temper a bit next year i would think that a lot of sellers would be motivated to have discussions now rather than wait and if they do wait then what would the subsequent year look like so we are at an historic alltime high and i think that is going to probably be the high watermark for the next year or two and if i were ever thinking about selling i think i would be wanting to have discussions today rather than wait till it tempers a bit leo kulp got it thank you very much operator i believe thats all the time we have for questions today i will now turn the call back to david passman ceo s david passman iii thank you in closing i just want to take an opportunity to thank the very talented and dedicated team of associates we have across the carmike circuit their work really drove our success in the second quarter as it does in every quarter we look

main content advertisement carmikes new direction veteran executives reinvigorate pioneering us theatre circuit jul   tweet carmikemdjpg “i am a movie junkie as is my wife” admits david passman the newly appointed president and chief executive officer of carmike cinemas inc passman a respected fixture on the columbus georgiabased circuit’s board since june  had been serving as its chairman since january that position is now held by roland c smith a sevenyear board veteran who counts president and chief executive officer of wendy’sarby’s group inc among his other responsibilities “when the opportunity to join the carmike board first presented itself back in  it was quite easy for me to decide” passman recalls about his reasons for joining a motion picture exhibitor that at last count operated  theatres with  screens wwwcarmikecom during that time his financial background made him a commodity “as an independent candidate for board positions” he explains “i got to interview a lot of public companies but…navigated in the general direction of entertainment… secondly as carmike had just emerged from bankruptcy from a legalliability fiduciaryresponsibility preservationofpersonalwealth standpoint it was a fairly safe thing to do because carmike was starting with a clean slate frankly speaking my due diligence was a lot easier that way” thirdly he “wanted a middlemarket company that wasn’t a dominant player already but instead provided the opportunity to grow with them and offered something that i could make an impact on” passman’s announcement that senior vp general counsel and secretary lee champion was sitting in on his conversation with film journal international had its own impact on this author who had never had a legal eagle present in his many years of reporting i assumed it was all about watching the allimportant forwardlooking statements as a publicly traded company see disclaimer below “that’s not why lee’s here” passman insisted “lee’s part of my executive team” chief operating officer fred van noy and chief financial officer richard b hare also joined the interview thankfully the presence of legal counsel had nothing to do with the author’s reputation either “not at all” passman laughed “i have been advised that this would be a very pleasant experience” he said he and his team selected fji specifically to share the news about changes at the company “within our exhibition industry” he notes “carmike has been kind of a silent player… we have not been involved on industry matters as much as our size would dictate my message to the industry would be ‘carmike is back’ and carmike is going to be a good industry player and partner to other exhibitors” as a company player passman sets the tone on partnership as well “first and foremost let me restate ‘running’ the company to ‘leading’ it” he clarifies “the reason why i’ve got three gentlemen in this room with me is that i’m not running the company we all are the leadership change that has recently occurred is not to indict the management it’s rather to say that change was needed the board and i believed and continue to believe…that we have very good leadership within the carmike management team” having said that passman tells our readers “that there is not an awful lot of change in strategy that is needed at carmike but a sharper focus on attention to detail” instead “we are still going through a strategic review to determine how many theatres we want to have over what period of time in order to make this circuit all that it can be everything is on the table” he confirms “from shutting down underperforming theatres to building more aggressively new theatres to acquiring smaller circuits to additional financing and refinancings public offerings and all that everything is under study strategically until we come up with a plan that we are ready to publish” touching on just one of the options “yes you can absolutely grow in smaller markets” passman affirms “smalltown america is a wonderful marketplace for us in two respects one is that each of the communities that we target are not big enough and don’t look to become big enough to warrant a lot of competition secondly there are still many communities across america where people have to drive up to an hour to see a movie those are very attractive markets for us” “the core focus of our business model has always been and still is to stay in the small to midmarkets “concurs ceo fred van noy “going through the unfortunate process of chapter  reorganization did not cause us to move away from that model that situation was more a function of the stadiumseating revolution that changed our entire industry” than the actual location of the theatres “i’m not trying to pat ourselves on the back here but we are the experts in smalltown operations we understand the markets and have plenty of experience to prove it” while carmike has theatres in several major cities as well “we have opened or are under construction with five new theatres in small markets that are doing very well we see no reason to move outside of that model” as the first circuit to fully deploy dcinema on a large scale in partnership with christie digital and cinedigm “we are completely done and there is nothing more for us to do” van noy enthuses “we’re very pleased with the decision and the systems” with the rollout including some  digital d installations “absolutely behind us” he affirms “now our job is to capitalize on the new technology and open all the doors that we feel this opportunity provides us with” while there is “not one regret” to be had about going with dlp cinema utilizing the technology in new ways and working with alternative content “is a work in progress from now ’til whoknowswhen” although carmike is trying out “every bit of content that we can get our hands on” he feels “at this point we are just scratching the surface” ranking number four circuitwide in terms of  boxoffice performance while not even scratching the top ten nationwide the hannah montana d concert movie is proof positive van noy says “this solidifies what we can do with the technology and demonstrates the material effect that pushing that door open can have by capitalizing on something that is hot and new” bigtime and bigcity entertainment on the smalltown big screen sounds like a promising proposition indeed in the long term he predicts “it is about changing the consumer mindset from a theatredownthestreet to an entertainment complex that offers more product outside of the movies” “if we have a sixscreen theatre in village ville” he says illustrating another benefit “there are certain movies that are perhaps not worth the gamble of taking up that limited screen space while it is an absolute nobrainer to play the large platform pictures it’s somewhat harder to try out a movie that traditionally doesn’t play in that type of market” with digital technology however “the flexibility allows us to test a lot more different product thereby potentially increasing attendance and widening the spectrum of moviegoing” in fact showing “arttype feature presentations in select locations” becomes as simple as “beaming them in over satellite” passman adds “i am really excited with regards to digital that we have an avenue to do things in our complexes that we could not while showing celluloid film only we can do realtime business conferences church programs concerts and live sports” the latter by the way are possible “in threedimensional totalimmersion viewing” passman reminds citing the bcs championship back in january “shown on only three percent of our available screens it became our numberone grossing performer for the entire circuit on that thursday night” for passman it is all about “better utilization of those massive structures that the industry has built we have  of them ourselves and we want to use them better” with digital technology “we see a lot of upside potential to get more patrons to more of our locations and more frequently” “we had the firstmover advantage with this fantastic technology” confirms chief financial officer richard hare about the offbalancesheet financing with minimal investment on carmike’s part “in essence we are leasing the equipment in addition to paying an annual maintenance fee our outofpocket cost was for the installation and prep work at our theatres” though he doesn’t address whether the investors were happy about this financially prudent way of going digital—we’ll just assume they never are—hare will attest that “the investment community was pleased with the results of our first quarter” carmike had increases in ebitda in adjusted and net incomes as well “we had a very strong quarter as we continued to delever the business in addition to the industry upswing in box office we lowered our debt and strengthened our balance sheet over the past  months we’ve paid down about  million worth of our debt and as we go on to make improvements in our operations and in our overhead we’ll see that reflected in our stock price” “carmike’s performance kind of lagged the industry a bit over the past couple of years” passman notes just as he did at the annual shareholders meeting “the company’s operating performance lag resulted in our stock prices dropping rather dramatically what i believe happened is that our stockholders had lost confidence in our ability to generate meaningful and sustainable profitability” after all “no one questioned our strategy on digital no one questioned our circuit strategy on building in markets with limited competition but people were questioning our ability to just be paying attention to the details” consequently passman has set out “what our new marching orders are” admittedly “we took our eyes off the ball in the past but we’re putting them back where they belong frankly details matter if a patron comes into the theatre and isn’t greeted by a friendly face and isn’t thanked for his or her business if they have to stand in line at the concession stand after the movie starts and go into a restroom finding it to be less than clean…he or she isn’t probably all that inclined to want to come back to our theatre” this said “by making a few changes in select locations over just a really short period of time” passman “has seen that the attendance and concession unit sales increase in direct proportion to the cleanliness and the friendliness of the environment that the patron experiences” with attention to detail revived passman names “the biggest challenge right now for carmike as a company is returning to certainty in leadership if you want to run a really good company the troops have to have faith in their leadership and they need to know consistent leadership if you have a ‘flavor of the month club’ where you are always issuing a new strategic direction for the company employees get callused to any kind of change for us as the leadership team the challenge then becomes to instill that degree of confidence the direction we are headed is a straight line not a jagged one we are really serious about the patron experience” drawing that line not just in the sand but into the future will people still be going to the movies  or  years from now passman certainly thinks they will “they may be viewing a different kind of presentation” he envisions “today the buzz is threedimensional viewing which we believe immerses the patron into the experience of the actual feature movie i believe tomorrow you will see interactive d and some time further into the future you will see some different type of threedimensional bordering on holograms perhaps but you’ll always have the big screen and joint experience with a group of people”the author wishes to thank lisa de la cruz for her assistance as with all publicly traded companies the conversations reflected in this article include “forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws” these include without being limited to “statements that are not historical facts including statements about the company’s beliefs expectations and future performance” especially “expectations regarding…future prospects and positioning to further enhance shareholder value” executive bioscarmike cinemas’ new president and
