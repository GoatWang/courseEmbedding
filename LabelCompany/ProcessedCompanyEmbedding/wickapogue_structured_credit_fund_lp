fund lp notes to financial statements continued december      significant accounting policies continued   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the funds financial statements are reasonable and prudent however actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that differences could be material valuation of investments cdos and other structured credit investments are priced based upon valuations provided by independent third party pricing agents using their proprietary valuation methodology the thirdparty pricing agents may value structured credit investments at an evaluated bid price by employing methodologies that utilize actual market transactions brokersupplied valuations or other methodologies designed to identify the market value for such securities such methodologies generally consider such factors as security prices yields maturities call features ratings and developments relating to specific securities in arriving at valuations if a price for a cdo or other structured credit investment cannot be obtained from an independent thirdparty pricing agent the fund shall seek to obtain a bid price from at least one dealer who is independent of the fund in such cases the independent dealer providing the price on the cdo or structured credit investment may also be a market maker and in many cases the only market maker with respect to that security as of december   all assetbacked securities are valued by an independent dealer who is also a market maker a dealers valuation reflects its judgment of the price of an asset assuming an arms length transaction at the valuation date between knowledgeable willing market participants and sufficient time in advance of the valuation date to market the instrument it generally assumes a round lot institutional transaction without consideration for whether the client is long or short the instrument and without adjustment for the size of the clients position the valuation pertains to an assumed transaction does not necessarily reflect actual quoted or other prices and does not indicate that an active market exists for the financial instrument    table of contents sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december      significant accounting policies continued   valuation of investments continued a dealers valuation may be formulated using inputs such as a combination of observable market transactions of the exact security or a similar security and internal models bidswantedin competition or bwics are widely distributed auctions of securities whose results are the primary input used by dealers to establish valuations for structured credit securities dealers supplement bwic results with private transactions and modeldriven valuations modeldriven valuations require assumptions regarding default recovery and prepayment rates that are consistent with current market conditions in situations where market inputs are not available or do not provide a sufficient basis under current market conditions for pricing the instrument the valuation may reflect the dealers view of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument since market participants may have materially different views as to future supply demand credit quality and other factors relevant to pricing financial instruments as well as bid and ask prices valuations may differ materially among dealers the actual level at which these instruments trade if trades occur could be materially different from the dealers valuation debt obligations with remaining maturities of sixty days or less may be valued at their amortized cost which approximates fair value investments in openended investment companies are valued based on reported nav of the investment company securities for which market prices are not readily available or may be unreliable are valued in accordance with fair value procedures established by the board the funds fair value procedures are implemented through a fair value committee the committee designated by the board when a security is valued in accordance with the fair value procedures the committee will determine the value after taking into consideration relevant information reasonably available to the committee examples of factors the committee may consider are the last trade price the performance of the market or of the issuers industry the liquidity of the security the size of the holding in the fund or any other appropriate information the determination of a securitys fair value price often involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors and is therefore subject to the unavoidable risk that the value assigned to a security may be higher or lower than the securitys value would be if a reliable market quotation for the security was readily available at december   there were no securities that were fair valued by the committee    table of contents sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december      significant accounting policies continued   valuation of investments concluded certain structured credit investments may be structured as private investment partnerships traditionally a trading market for holdings of this type does not exist the fair value of the funds interest in such a private investment fund will represent the amount that the fund could reasonably expect to receive from the private investment fund if the funds interest were sold at the time of valuation determined based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the fund believes to be reliable unless determined otherwise in accordance with the funds fair value procedures the fair value of the funds interest in a private investment fund will usually be the value attributed to such interest as of that time of valuation as reported to the fund by the private investment funds manager administrator or other designed agent as a practical matter the adviser and the board have little or no means of independently verifying the valuations provided by such private investment funds in the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not report a value to the fund on a timely basis and such fund is not priced by independent pricing agents of the fund the fund committee would determine the fair value of the private investment fund based on the most recent value reported by the private investment fund as well as any other relevant information available at the time the fund values its portfolio as of december   there were no securities fair valued in accordance with the funds fair value procedures the board will periodically review the funds valuation policies and will update them as necessary to reflect changes in the types of securities in which the fund invests fair value of financial instruments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosure under gaap the fund discloses the fair value of its investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure the fair value the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price    table of contents sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december      significant accounting policies continued   fair value of financial instruments continued accordingly the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level  

foreign senior secured loans senior unsecured loans and subordinate corporate loans including loans that may be rated below investment grade or equivalent unrated loans cdos may charge management fees and administrative expenses for cdos the cashflows from the trust are split into two or more portions called tranches varying in risk and yield the riskiest portion is the equity tranche which bears the bulk of defaults from the bonds or loans in the trust and serves to protect the other more senior tranches from default in all but the most severe circumstances since it is partially protected from defaults a senior tranche from a cdo trust typically has a higher rating and lower yield than their underlying securities and can be rated investment grade despite the protection from the equity tranche cdo tranches can experience substantial losses due to actual defaults increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches market anticipation of defaults as well as aversion to cdo securities as a class the risks of an investment in a cdo depend largely on the type of the collateral securities and the class of the cdo in which the fund invests normally clos and other cdos are privately offered and sold and thus are not registered under the securities laws as a result investments in cdos may be characterized by the fund as illiquid

performance risk the funds market risk management strategy is driven by the funds investment objective the adviser oversees each of the risks in accordance with policies and procedures i price risk price risk is the risk the value of the instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment its issuer or any factor affecting financial instruments traded in the market as all of the funds financial instruments are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognized in the statement of operations all changes in market conditions directly affect net assets ii interest rate risk the fair value of the funds investments will change in response to interest rate changes and other factors during periods of falling interest rates the values of fixed income securities generally rise conversely during periods of rising interest rates the values of such securities generally decline changes by recognized rating agencies in the ratings of any fixed income security and in the ability of an issuer to make payments of interest and principal may also affect the value of these investments iii prepayment risk prepayment risk is the risk associated with the early unscheduled return of principal on a fixedincome security some fixedincome securities such as cdos have embedded call options which may be exercised by the issuer or in the case of a cdo the borrower the yieldtomaturity of such securities cannot be known for certain at the time of purchase since the cash flows are not known when principal is returned early future interest payments will not be paid on that part of the principal if the security was purchased at a premium a price greater than  the securitys yield will be less than what was estimated at the time of purchase iv collateral performance risk collateral performance risk is the risk that defaults or underperformance of the cdos underlying collateral negatively

as necessary to perform any of the activities set forth below any action requiring approval of the committee shall be deemed approved upon an affirmative vote by a majority of the committee present or represented the submission of votes electronically ie via email by the committee members shall be considered acceptable the committee shall consult with counsel or other experts as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities  approval of proxy voting guidelinesthe committee shall approve guidelines that set forth the manner in which simc shall vote or the manner in which simc shall determine how to vote with respect to various matters that may come up for shareholder vote with respect to securities held in client accounts and for which simc has proxy voting responsibility in the event that any employee of simc recommends a change to simcs guidelines the committee shall meet to consider the proposed change and consider all relevant factors if approved by the committee the change shall be accepted and the guidelines revised accordingly  certain proxy votes may not be castin some cases the committee may determine that it is in the best interests of simcs clients to abstain from voting certain proxies simc will abstain from voting in the event any of the following conditions  are met with regard to a proxy proposal        neither the proxy voting guidelines nor specific client instructions cover an issue        the service does not make a recommendation on the issue        in circumstances where in simcs judgment the costs of voting the proxy exceed the expected benefits to clients or        the committee cannot convene on the proxy proposal at issue to make a determination as to what would be in the clients best interest this could happen for example if the committee found that there was a material conflict or if despite all best efforts the committee is unable to meet the requirements necessary to make a determination in addition it is simcs policy not to vote proxies for accounts that engage in securities lending simc believes that the additional income derived by clients from such activities generally outweighs the potential economic benefit of recalling securities for the purpose of voting therefore simc generally will not recall securities on loan for the sole purpose of voting proxies further in accordance with local law or business practices many foreign companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the meeting share blocking depending on the country in which a company is domiciled the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the meeting eg one three or five days or on a date established by the company while practices vary in many countries the block period can be continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and postponed to a later date similarly practices vary widely as to the ability of a shareholder to have the block restriction lifted early eg in some countries shares generally can be unblocked up to two days prior to the meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be discretionary with the issuers transfer agent simc believes that the disadvantage table of contents of being unable to sell the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the advantages of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items accordingly simc generally will not vote those proxies subject to share blocking  proxies of investment companieswith respect to proxies of an affiliated investment company or series thereof such as the sei funds the committee will vote such proxies in the same proportion as the vote of all other shareholders of the investment company or series thereof ie echo vote or mirror vote when required by law the committee will also echo vote proxies of an unaffiliated investment company when not required to echo vote the committee will delegate to the service responsibility for voting proxies of an unaffiliated investment company in accordance with guidelines approved by the committee provided that if such proxy presents a material conflict of interest for simc such proxy shall be voted in accordance with section  below  conflicts of interestthe service makes available to simc prior to voting on a proxy its recommendation on how to vote with respect to such proxy in light of simcs guidelines simc retains the authority to overrule the services recommendation and instruct the service to vote in a manner at variance with the services recommendation the exercise of such right could implicate a conflict of interest as a result simc may not overrule the services recommendation with respect to a proxy unless the following steps are taken     a the committee shall meet to consider the proposal to overrule the services recommendation     b the committee must determine whether simc has a conflict of interest with respect to the issuer that is the subject of the proxy the committee will use the following standards to identify issuers with which it may have a conflict of interest      significant business relationships  the committee will determine whether simc or its affiliates may have a significant business relationship with the issuer such as for example where simc or an affiliate manages a pension plan administers employee benefit plans or provide brokerage underwriting insurance or banking services to the issuer for this purpose a significant business relationship is one that  represents  or  of simcs or an affiliates revenues for the most recent fiscal year whichever is less or is reasonably expected to represent this amount for the current fiscal year or  may not directly involve revenue to simc or its affiliates but is otherwise determined by the committee to be significant to simc or its affiliates such as for example the following        simc or its affiliates lease significant office space from the company or have some other real estaterelated relationship with the issuer        simc or an affiliate otherwise has a significant relationship with the company such that it might create an incentive for simc to vote in favor of management      significant personalfamily relationships  the committee will determine whether any employees who are involved in the proxy voting process may have a significant personalfamily relationship with the issuer for this purpose a significant personalfamily relationship is one that would be reasonably likely to influence how simc votes proxies to identify any such relationships the committee shall obtain information about any significant personalfamily relationship between any employee of simc who is involved in the proxy voting process eg imu analysts members of the committee senior management as applicable and senior employees of issuers for which simc may vote proxies      duties of the proxy committeethe committee has a duty to make reasonable investigation of information relating to conflicts of interest for purposes of table of contents   identifying conflicts the committee shall rely on publicly available information about simc and its affiliates information about simc and its affiliates that is generally known by employees of simc and other information actually known by a member of the committee absent actual knowledge the committee is not required to investigate possible conflicts involving simc where the information is i nonpublic ii subject to information blocking procedures or iii otherwise not readily available to the committee in connection with the consideration of any proxy voting matters under this policy each member of the committee has a duty to disclose to the committee any material conflicts of interest of which the member has actual knowledge but which have not been identified by the committee pursuant to these procedures and if appropriate recuse himselfherself from the matter at issue     c if simc determines that it has a conflict of interest the committee shall determine whether the conflict is material to any specific proposal included within the proxy if not then simc can vote the proxy as determined by the committee the committee shall determine whether a proposal is material as follows      routine proxy proposals  proxy proposals that are routine shall be presumed not to involve a material conflict of interest for simc unless the committee has actual knowledge that a routine proposal should be treated as material for this purpose routine proposals would typically include matters such as the selection of an accountant uncontested election of directors meeting formalities and approval of an annual reportfinancial statements       nonroutine proxy proposals  proxy proposals that are nonroutine shall be presumed to involve a material conflict of interest for simc unless the committee determines that simcs conflict is unrelated to the proposal in question see  below for this purpose nonroutine proposals would typically include any contested matter including a contested election of directors a merger or sale of substantial assets a change in the articles of incorporation that materially affects the rights of shareholders and compensation matters for management eg stock option plans retirement plans profit sharing or other special remuneration plans      determining that a nonroutine proposal is not material  as discussed above although nonroutine proposals are presumed to involve a material conflict of interest the committee may determine on a casebycase basis that particular nonroutine proposals do not involve a material conflict of interest to make this determination the committee must conclude that a proposal is not directly related to simcs conflict with the issuer or that it otherwise would not be considered important by a reasonable investor the committee shall record in writing the basis for any such determination     d for any proposal where the committee determines that simc has a material conflict of interest simc may vote a proxy regarding that proposal in any of the following manners      obtain client consent or direction  if the committee approves the proposal to overrule the recommendation of the service simc shall fully disclose to each client holding the security at issue the nature of the conflict and obtain the clients consent     the procedures provide that the committee should be aware of information about simc or its affiliates that is generally known by employees of simc but it does not extend this knowledge to information about simcs affiliates that is generally known by employees of simcs affiliates unless such information also is generally known by simcs employees   for guidance on defining routine and nonroutine matters simc shall use the standards set forth in nyse rule  and special instruction bviii of form f table of contents to how simc will vote on the proposal or otherwise obtain instructions from the client as to how the proxy on the proposal should be voted      use recommendation of the service  vote in accordance with the services recommendation     e for any proposal where the committee determines that simc does not have a material conflict of interest the committee may overrule the services recommendation if the committee reasonably determines that doing so is in the best interests of simcs clients if the committee decides to overrule the services recommendation the committee shall maintain a written record setting forth the basis of the committees decision     f this section  does not apply to voting proxies of an investment company except as specifically stated in section  above   item  portfolio managers of closedend management investment companies compensation the adviser compensates each portfolio manager for his management of the fund each portfolio managers compensation consists of a fixed annual salary plus a discretionary annual bonus calculated on the following factors      fund performance relative to a return objective andor benchmark index    sei corporate performance typically based upon earnings per share for a fiscal year and    individual performance relative to annual goals and objectives ownership of fund shares as of the date of this registration statement the portfolio managers did not beneficially own any shares of the fund other accounts as of december   in addition to the fund the portfolio managers were responsible for the daytoday management of certain other accounts as listed below the accounts

interests each portfolio managers management of other accounts may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in connection with his management of the funds investments on the one table of contents hand and the investments of the other accounts on the other the other accounts include portions of two us registered high yield mutual funds and an irish registered high yield fund collectively the other accounts the other accounts might have similar investment objectives as the fund or hold purchase or sell securities that are eligible to be held purchased or sold by the fund while the portfolio managers management of the other accounts may give rise to the following potential conflicts of interest the adviser does not believe that the conflicts if any are material or to the extent any such conflicts are material the adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage those conflicts in an appropriate way knowledge of the timing and size of fund trades a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers daytoday management of the fund because of their position with the fund the portfolio managers know the size timing and possible market impact of fund trades it is theoretically possible that the portfolio managers could use this information to the advantage of the other accounts and to the possible detriment of the fund however the adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time investment opportunities a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers management of the fund and the other accounts which in theory may allow them to allocate investment opportunities in a way that favors the other accounts over the fund this conflict of interest may be exacerbated to the extent that the adviser or the portfolio managers receive or expect to receive greater compensation from their management of the other accounts than the fund notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest it is the advisers policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and as discussed above the adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time and in a manner consistent with each accounts investment objectives and related restrictions for example while the portfolio managers may buy for an other account securities that differ in identity or quantity from securities bought for the fund such an approach might not be suitable for the fund given its investment objectives and related restrictions the adviser may enter into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the sei structured credit segregated portfolio the offshore feeder fund a segregated portfolio of sei offshore advanced strategies series spc a segregated portfolio company established in the cayman islands that acts as a feeder fund for the fund whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset value of such investors investment in the offshore feeder fund over a given period shall be payable to the adviser this arrangement may create an incentive for the adviser to make investments for the fund that are riskier or more speculative than if the adviser had no such interest because the adviser will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of the offshore feeder funds assets if the value of its investment in the fund declines notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest it is the advisers policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and the adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are designed to manage such conflict in an appropriate way   item  purchases of equity securities by closedend
