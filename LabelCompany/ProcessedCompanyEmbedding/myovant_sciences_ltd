orally administered small molecule investigational drug candidate that has the potential to be bestinclass for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis and a potential best and firstinclass treatment for advanced prostate cancer  how it worksrelugolix is an oral oncedaily gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh receptor antagonist by inhibiting gnrh receptors in the anterior pituitary gland relugolix rapidly reduces the circulating gonadotropins luteinizing hormone lh and folliclestimulating hormone fsh leading to the suppression of estrogen in women and testosterone in men suppression of these hormones improves the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and decreases prostatespecific antigen psa levels in men with advanced prostate cancer in a doubleblind placebocontrolled phase  clinical trial in  patients with uterine fibroids women who received relugolix experienced a statistically significant reduction in menorrhagia or heavy menstrual bleeding in a doubleblind placebocontrolled phase  clinical trial in  patients with endometriosis women who received relugolix experienced statistically significant reductions in nonmenstrual and menstrual pelvic pain in two randomized phase  studies in approximately  men with advanced prostate cancer oral oncedaily relugolix suppressed serum testosterone to castrate levels and decreased psa across all phase  studies relugolix was generally welltolerated and its safety profile was consistent with its mechanism of action takeda is currently conducting two phase  studies in women with uterine fibroids in japan unlike gnrh agonists relugolix does not cause transient increases in gonadotropin secretion flare which can result in an initial worsening of clinical symptoms moreover upon treatment discontinuation its effects diminish quickly and hormone levels rapidly return to baseline we believe relugolix when coadministered with lowdose estrogen and progesterone addback therapy will preserve

or  mg was generally well tolerated during the  weeks comprising the initial week study and the week extension study treatmentemergent adverse events for patients receiving relugolix such as hot flush and menorrhagia were consistent with the drugs mechanism of action efficacy outcomes for the full week period were consistent with outcomes during the initial week trial with greater dosedependent reductions in overall pelvic pain dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain seen in the relugolix treatment arms compared to placebo the largest decrease was seen in the relugolix mg group throughout the treatment period and the reductions in the mean visual analogue scale vas score from baseline for overall pelvic pain dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain in the relugolix mg group were similar to those in an active reference group receiving monthly injections of leuprorelin the findings were presented during a poster presentation on may  at the  european congress of endocrinology in lisbon portugal of the  patients randomized and administered study drug in the initial week study   were enrolled in the extension study and   of enrolled patients completed the treatment period for the extension study there were no clinically relevant differences in the demographic and baseline characteristics of the treatment groups the incidence of mild and moderate adverse events in the relugolix  and mg groups was higher than that observed in the placebo group and comparable to that observed in an active reference group receiving monthly injections of leuprorelin the most commonly observed adverse events occurring in at least  of patients in the relugolix groups and greater in the relugolix than placebo groups were primarily mild or moderate in severity and included irregular

millimeter mm vas in which  mm indicated no pain and  mm indicated pain as bad as you can imagine scores were reported daily in patient diaries the mean reduction in overall pelvic pain for the relugolix mg group at the end of the extension study was  mm from baseline  mm compared to a mean reduction of  mm in the placebo arm from baseline  mm the reduction achieved by relugolix  mg orally once daily was comparable to that observed in the active control arm of patients receiving monthly injections of leuprorelin for pain during menses or dysmenorrhea the relugolix mg group achieved a mean reduction of  mm at the end of extension study from baseline  mm compared to a mean reduction of  mm in the placebo group from baseline  mm no clear trend was observed in mean vas scores from

chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder alzheimer’s usually develops slowly and can get worse over time according to the alzheimer’s association alzheimer’s disease affects approximately  million people in the united states today and the number of patients afflicted with the disease is growing every year by  it is projected that approximately  million people will be living with alzheimer’s disease in the us in  total healthcare costs for alzheimer’s and other dementias are estimated to reach  billion in the us alone meanwhile no new treatment options for patients have been approved by the fda for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease since an estimated  of alzheimer’s disease patients age  and older are classified as mildtomoderate which is the patient population axovant is focused on treating with intepirdine rvt axovant is currently developing intepirdine in a phase  international multicenter doubleblind placebocontrolled study designed to evaluate the safety tolerability and efficacy of intepirdine in mildtomoderate alzheimer’s disease patients called the mindset studylearn more about mindset × dementia with lewy bodies dlb lewy body dementia or lbd is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the second most common form of dementia lbd is characterized by a buildup of abnormal proteins known as lewy bodies in areas of the brain that control cognition movement alertness and behavior lewy body dementia includes two similar conditions – dementia with lewy bodies or dlb and parkinson’s disease dementia or pdd the primary difference between both conditions generally depends on the timing of the onset of cognitive decline relative to the onset of movementrelated symptoms in dementia with lewy bodies cognitive decline generally occurs within one year of the onset of movement disorder symptoms in parkinson’s disease dementia movement disorder symptoms precede cognitive decline by more than a year along with suffering from impaired cognition and behavioral disturbances lbd patients often suffer from visual hallucinations fluctuations in cognition attention and alertness sensitivity to neuroleptic antipsychotic medications rem behavior disorder or rbd in which people physically act out their dreams and parkinsonism movement disorder with symptoms including muscle rigidity and tremors the lewy body dementia association estimates that there are  million patients with lewy body dementia in the united states our subsidiary axovant is currently developing two drug candidates to treat certain aspects of lewy body dementia – intepirdine rvt and nelotanserin currently there are no drugs approved by the fda for the treatment of dlb intepirdine has the potential to be the first drug approved by the fda for the treatment of dlb learn more about mindset × gait and balance impairments in dementia axovant is currently conducting a phase  study to evaluate the effects of intepirdine on gait and balance in patients with alzheimers disease dementia with lewy bodies and parkinsons disease dementia in this study axovant intends to further investigate the observation of a reduced rate of falls seen in patients treated with intepirdine in a prior patient study of intepirdine on a background of stable donepezil therapy × visual hallucinations in lewy body dementia axovant is currently conducting a phase  multicenter doubleblind placebocontrolled crossover study evaluating nelotanserin in patients with lewy body dementia lbd suffering from visual hallucinations the safety efficacy and tolerability of nelotanserin at doses of  mg and  mg will be evaluated over a week treatment period in approximately  subjects with lbd this is a crossover study so every subject will receive placebo for  weeks and nelotanserin for  weeks but neither patients or their doctor will know which treatment they are taking the primary outcome measure will be safety and tolerability the frequency and severity of visual hallucinations over a week treatment period will be a secondary outcome measure patients who complete the study will be eligible to receive nelotanserin in an extension study

bodies dlb experiencing rapid eye movement rem sleep behavior disorder rbd the efficacy safety and tolerability of  mg of nelotanserin will be evaluated over a week period in approximately  patients with dlb the primary efficacy evaluation will be a change in the frequency of rem sleep behaviors by the end of  weeks patients who complete the study will be eligible to receive nelotanserin in an extension study learn more here × alzheimer’s diseaseaxovant plans to develop and if successful commercialize products that combine cholinesterase inhibitors with peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonists including glycopyrrolate which could mitigate the peripheral side effects of cholinesterase inhibitorsaxovant recently completed a proof of concept study for rvt designed to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile safety and tolerability of  mg donepezil plus placebo versus  mg of donepezil when given concomitantly with one of three different regimens including either glycopyrrolate or trospium over a day period the study measured subject nausea in  healthy elderly subjects using a visual analog scale vas at baseline and once every two hours for eight hours after dosing on days    and on the final day of dosing when nausea for subjects in the  mg donepezil plus placebo arm achieved a peak mean change from baseline on the vas subjects in the arms receiving  mg donepezil plus either glycopyrrolate or trospium demonstrated a  percent to  percent reduction in nausea relative to the  mg donepezil plus placebo armbased on these results the company expects to meet with the us food and drug administration fda to discuss additional studies that could support registration of rvt and expects to initiate a proof of concept study for rvt in the second half of  × prostate cancer prostate cancer is a malignant transformation of tissue within the male prostate gland often characterized by slow growth prostate cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the united states approximately  million men in the united states are currently living with prostate cancer and  men are newly diagnosed each year symptoms of prostate cancer include increased urinary frequency dysuria hematuria and nocturnal urination current treatments include combinations of surgery radiation or proton beam therapy androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy myovant is currently developing relugolix an oral oncedaily gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh receptor antagonist by inhibiting gnrh receptors in the anterior pituitary gland relugolix rapidly reduces the circulating gonadotropin luteinizing hormone lh and folliclestimulating hormone fsh leading to the suppression of estrogen in women and testosterone in men suppression of these hormones improves the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and decreases prostatespecific antigen psa levels in men with advanced prostate cancer learn more here × uterine fibroidsuterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop from the muscle and connective tissue of the uterus approximately  of women of reproductive age have uterine fibroids and  in  experience symptoms requiring treatment although uterine fibroids are benign tumors they may cause debilitating symptoms including heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding anemia and pelvic pain current treatments include hormonal contraceptives gnrh agonists and surgical interventions including myomectomy and hysterectomymyovant is currently developing relugolix an oral oncedaily gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh receptor antagonist by inhibiting gnrh receptors in the anterior pituitary gland relugolix rapidly reduces the circulating gonadotropin luteinizing hormone lh and folliclestimulating hormone fsh leading to the suppression of estrogen in women and testosterone in men suppression of these hormones improves the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and decreases prostatespecific antigen psa levels in men with advanced prostate cancerlearn more here × endometriosisendometriosis is a gynecological medical condition in which cells that normally line the uterus grow outside of the uterine cavity an estimated  million women in the united states have endometriosis and  in  experience symptoms requiring treatment during the menstrual cycle endometriosis lesions grow differentiate and shed into the abdomen causing symptoms including nonmenstrual pelvic pain and pain during menstruation dysmenorrhea current treatments include hormonal contraceptives danazol gnrh agonists and various surgical interventions for severe casesmyovant is currently developing relugolix an oral oncedaily gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh receptor antagonist by inhibiting gnrh receptors in the anterior pituitary gland relugolix rapidly reduces the circulating gonadotropin luteinizing hormone lh and folliclestimulating hormone fsh leading to the suppression of estrogen in women and testosterone in men suppression of these hormones improves the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and decreases prostatespecific antigen psa levels in men with advanced prostate cancerlearn more here × female infertility approximately  of infertile women have problems related to ovulation including the inability to produce fully matured eggs or release an egg from the ovary ie “ovulate” in the course of treating infertility related to anovulation fertility specialists use a group of medications to temporarily correct ovulatory problems and increase a woman’s chance for pregnancy these and related procedures are broadly termed assisted reproductive technology or art approximately  million cycles of art were performed globally in  myovant is currently developing mvt an analog of kisspeptin a naturallyoccurring peptide in humans that plays a key role in egg maturation and ovulation by increasing the release of lh and fsh through the stimulation of gnrh secretion recent evidence from trials performed in women undergoing assisted reproduction revealed that the native kisspeptin peptide has the potential to act as an alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin hcg or gnrh agonists in triggering egg maturation an essential step in all assisted reproduction cycles myovant believes that mvt may induce the release of lh and fsh in a manner that more closely mimics natural physiology potentially avoiding side effects associated with hcg or gnrh agonist administration including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss learn more here × farber disease farber disease is an ultrarare lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in both alleles of the asah gene resulting in the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase this leads to the accumulation of the proinflammatory sphingolipid ceramide and a macrophage driven inflammatory process causing the development of typical clinical symptoms like many other lysosomal storage diseases farber disease has a broad phenotypic spectrum and is likely underdiagnosed farber patients typically present with the cardinal symptoms of joint contractures or arthritis subcutaneous nodules and weak or hoarse voice it may take years for all three cardinal symptoms to appear together and they may vary greatly in severity patients may also present with systemic inflammation fever severe pain peripheral osteolysis failure to thrive and developmental delay recombinant human acid ceramidase rhac is an enzyme replacement therapy ert under development for the treatment of farber disease initially developed by dr edward schuchman at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai rhac showed positive results in various preclinical studies rhac was granted orphan drug designation by the us food and drug administration enzyvant is currently conducting the preclinical studies for rhac to enable a clinical trial in patients with farber disease learn more here × complete digeorge syndrome digeorge syndrome is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in multiple genes on chromosome  leading to defective development of the pharyngeal pouch system and variety of consequences including congenital heart disease dysfunctional calcium metabolism and thymic hypoplasia among others children born with complete digeorge syndrome cdgs represent approximately  of the overall digeorge population and lack any thymic tissue athymia this causes severe immunodeficiency due to an inability to produce normally functioning tcells which defend against infection and regulate essential processes in the immune system cdgs is uniformly fatal if untreated with death typically occurring in the first two years of life due to susceptibility to infection rvt is a biologic therapy being developed for the treatment of primary immune deficiency resulting from cdgs rvt utilizes proprietary processes developed by dr louise markert professor of pediatrics duke university to harvest culture and engraft allogeneic thymic tissue preliminary clinical results suggest a survival rate of over  for treated patients the findings of dr markert and her research team have been published in the new england journal of medicine as well as numerous other peerreviewed scientific journals and clinical publications rvt has been granted orphan drug designation breakthrough therapy designation and regenerative medicine advanced therapy rmat designation by the food and drug administration fda and enzyvant anticipates a potential bla filing in  for the treatment of cdgs enzyvant continues to collaborate with dr markert and is exploring other indications for which rvt may play a therapeutic role learn more here × mildtomoderate atopic dermatitis
