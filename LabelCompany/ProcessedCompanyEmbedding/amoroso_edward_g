intelligent national and international dialogue amongst the general technical community around proper methods for reducing national risk this includes controversial themes such as the deliberate use of deception to trap intruders it also serves as an attractive framework for a new national strategy for cyber security something that several presidential administrations have failed in attempting to create in addition nations other than the us might choose to adopt the framework as well this book covers cyber security policy development for massively complex infrastructure using ten principles derived from experiences in us federal government settings and a range of global commercial environments it provides a unique and provocative philosophy of cyber security that directly contradicts conventional wisdom about info sec for small or enterpriselevel systems it illustrates the use of practical trialanderror findings derived from  years of handson experience protecting critical infrastructure on a daily basis at att each principle is presented as a separate security strategy along with pages of compelling examples that demonstrate use of the principle cyber attacks will be
