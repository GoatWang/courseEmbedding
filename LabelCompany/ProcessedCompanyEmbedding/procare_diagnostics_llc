basic and translational cancer research dr fatatis’s work is focused on the identification of the cellular and molecular factors dictating the clinical progression of prostate cancer into its more aggressive form with the ultimate goal of identifying diagnostic markers and novel therapeutics for the effective management of patients with metastatic disease a major project in dr fatatis laboratory led to the discovery that targeting the alpha receptor for plateletderived growth factor pdgfr with imcg a humanized monoclonal antibody generated by imclone biosystems reduced bone metastases by  in preclinical models eli lilly and company is currently conducting phaseii clinical trials worldwide with this antibody now renamed olaratumab for several solid tumors including advanced prostate adenocarcinoma more recently dr fatatis has obtained conclusive evidence that a relevant fraction of prostate cancer cells in skeletal metastases lack expression of the androgen receptor ar and therefore their number and clinical progression cannot be monitored by measuring prostate specific antigen psa which is directly under the transcriptional control of ar dr fatatis
