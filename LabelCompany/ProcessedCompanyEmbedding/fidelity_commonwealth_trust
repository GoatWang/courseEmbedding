securities exchange act of  “exchange act” and will be the principal underwriter and distributor of the shares of the funds “shares”  each fund will invest in a portfolio of equity securities generally consisting of the component securities of a specified equity securities index an “underlying index” the initial fund will be based on the nasdaq composite index applicants request that the order also apply to any additional series of the trust or any series of any other existing or future investment company registered under the act that will a be based on an underlying index and operate pursuant to the terms and conditions of the application and b be advised by the advisor or an entity controlled by or under common control with the advisor each a “future fund” no entity that creates compiles sponsors or maintains an underlying index is or will be an affiliated person as defined in section a of the act or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of the trust the advisor a subadviser or promoter of a fund or the distributor  the investment objective of each fund will be to provide investment results that closely correspond to the price and yield performance of its underlying index intraday values of each underlying index will be disseminated every  seconds throughout regular trading hours on the listing market a fund will utilize either a replication strategy or a representative sampling strategy to track its underlying index a fund using a replication strategy generally will invest in substantially all of the component securities of its underlying index in the same approximate proportions as in the underlying index when a component security is illiquid or when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved in holding every security in an underlying index a fund may use a representative sampling strategy where it holds a representative sample of the component securities of the underlying index and will invest in some but not all of the component securities of its underlying index applicants anticipate that a fund using the representative sampling technique will not track its underlying index with the same degree of accuracy as an investment vehicle that invests in every component security of the underlying index with the same weighting as the underlying index applicants anticipate that the expected tracking error of a fund using the representative sampling technique will not exceed  net of fees or expenses  shares will be issued in aggregations of at least  or more “creation units” the price of a creation unit will range from  to  all orders to purchase creation units must be placed with the distributor by or through a depository trust company “dtc” participant that has executed a participation agreement with the distributor creation units generally will be issued in exchange for an inkind deposit of securities and cash a fund also may sell creation units on a “cash only” basis in limited circumstances a person purchasing a creation unit from a fund must make a “creation deposit” consisting of a securities selected by the advisor “deposit securities” and b a cash payment equal to the difference between the market value of the deposit securities and the net asset value “nav” of a creation unit “cash amount” an investor purchasing or start printed page redeeming creation units from a fund will be charged a fee “transaction fee” to prevent the dilution of the interests of the remaining shareholders resulting from costs incurred by the fund in connection with the purchase and redemption of the creation units each fund will provide complete disclosure about the transaction fee in its prospectus including the maximum amount of the transaction fee and the method of calculating the transaction fee will be disclosed in the trusts statement of additional information “sai”  orders to purchase creation units must be placed with the distributor who will be responsible for transmitting the orders to the relevant fund the distributor will maintain a record of creation unit purchases and send out confirmations to purchasers the distributor will also furnish a copy of the funds prospectus to those placing purchase orders  persons purchasing creation units from a fund may hold the shares or sell some or all of them in the secondary market shares of the funds will be listed on a listing market which will either be nasdaq or a national securities exchange as defined in section a of the act and traded in the secondary market in the same manner as other equity securities it is expected that one or more member firms of the listing market will act as a market maker or specialist “market maker” and maintain a market on the listing market for the shares the price of shares traded on a listing market will be based on a current bidoffer market each share is expected to have a market value of between  and  purchases and sales of shares in the secondary market will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges  applicants expect that purchasers of creation units will include institutional investors and arbitrageurs a market maker in providing for a fair and orderly secondary market for shares also may purchase creation units in connection with its marketmaking activities applicants expect that secondary market purchasers of shares will include both institutional and retail investors applicants expect that arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to continually purchase or redeem creation units at nav will ensure that the market price of shares will not vary much from its nav  shares will not be individually redeemable shares will only be redeemable in creation units from a fund to redeem an investor will have to accumulate enough shares to constitute a creation unit an investor redeeming a creation unit in most cases will receive a portfolio of securities “redemption securities” plus a balancing cash amount representing the difference between the nav of a creation unit and the market value of the redemption securities as with purchases a redeeming investor will pay a transaction fee an investor may receive the cash equivalent of a redemption security in certain circumstances such as if the investor is unable by law or policy to own a particular redemption security  applicants state that neither the trust nor any fund will be advertised marketed or otherwise held out as a traditional openend investment company or mutual fund rather applicants state that each fund and the trust will be marketed as a “nasdaqtraded fund” “exchangetraded fund” “investment company” “fund” and “trust” without reference to an “openend fund” or “mutual fund” except to compare and contrast the trust and the funds with conventional openend investment companies all marketing materials that describe the features or method of obtaining buying or selling creation units or shares will prominently disclose that shares are not individually redeemable and that shares may be acquired or redeemed from the fund in creation units only the same type of disclosure will be provided in each funds prospectus sai shareholder reports and investor educational materials issued or circulated in connection with the shares the trust will provide copies of its annual and semiannual shareholder reports to dtc participants for distribution to beneficial holders of shares  applicants note that the trust will have series that operate as “traditional” mutual funds that do not rely on the requested relief to ensure that investors clearly understand the differences between these series and the funds applicants agree to a number of disclosure measures detailed in the application including that the funds will have separate prospectuses than any other series of the trust applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under section c of the act granting an exemption from sections a a d and d of the act and rule c under the act and under sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a and a of the act  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provision of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act sections a and a of the act  section a of the act defines an “openend company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent because shares will not be individually redeemable applicants request an order that would permit the trust to register as an openend management investment company and issue shares that are redeemable in creation units only applicants state that investors may purchase shares in creation units from each fund and redeem creation units applicants further state that because the market price of shares will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities the market price of shares will not vary much from its nav section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security which is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its nav applicants state that secondary market start printed page trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices not at an offering price described in the prospectus and not at a price based on nav thus purchases and sales of shares in the secondary market will not comply with section d of the act and rule c under the act applicants request an exemption under section c from these provisions  applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d of the act and rule c under the act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing shares applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been designed to a prevent dilution caused by certain risklesstrading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers and c ensure an orderly distribution of investment company shares by eliminating price competition from dealers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price  applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices applicants state a that secondary market trading in shares will not cause dilution for owners of shares because such transactions do not directly involve fund assets and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day these variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand and not as a result of unjust or discriminatory manipulation therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers finally applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because competitive forces in the marketplace will ensure that the difference between the market price of shares and their nav remains narrow section d of the act  section d of the act provides in relevant part that the prospectus delivery exemption provided to dealer transactions by section  of the securities act does not apply to any transaction in a redeemable security issued by an openend investment company applicants request an exemption from section d to permit dealers selling shares to rely on the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section  of the securities act  applicants state that shares will be listed on a listing market and will be traded in a manner similar to other equity securities applicants note that dealers selling shares of closedend investment companies in the secondary market generally are not required to deliver a prospectus to the purchaser  applicants contend that shares as a listed security merit a reduction in the compliance costs and regulatory burdens resulting from the imposition of prospectus delivery obligations in the secondary market because shares will be listed on a listing market prospective investors will have access to several types of market information about shares applicants state that information regarding market price and volume will be continually available on a realtime basis throughout the day on brokers computer screens and other electronic services the previous days price and volume information for shares also will be published daily in the financial section of newspapers in addition the fund or the listing market also intends to maintain a web site that includes quantitative information updated on a daily basis including for each fund daily trading volume the closing nav and the reported closing price the web site for the fund will also include for each fund on a per share basis a a calculation of the premium or discount of the closing price against nav and b data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the daily closing price against nav within appropriate ranges for each of the four previous calendar quarters  investors also will receive a product description “product description” describing a fund and its shares applicants state that while not intended as a substitute for a prospectus the product description will contain information about shares that is tailored to meet the needs of investors purchasing shares in the secondary market sections a and  of the act  section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company section a of the act defines “affiliated person” to include any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person and any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person section a of the act provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns  or more of another persons voting securities applicants request an exemption from section a under sections c and b to permit persons that are affiliated persons of a fund or the trust solely by virtue of a a  or more or in excess of a  ownership interest of shares and affiliated persons of such affiliated persons that are not otherwise affiliated with such fund or trust or b a  or more or in excess of  ownership interest in a fund or other registered investment company or series advised by the advisor to purchase and redeem creation units through inkind transactions with the fund  section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the act applicants contend that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting the affiliated persons of a fund or the trust described above from purchasing or redeeming creation units through inkind transactions the deposit procedure for inkind purchases and the redemption procedure for inkind redemptions will be the same for start printed page all purchases and redemptions deposit securities and redemption securities will be valued in the same manner as the securities in the funds portfolio therefore applicants state that inkind purchases and redemptions will afford no opportunity for an affiliated person described above to effect a transaction detrimental to the other holders of shares applicants also believe that inkind purchases and redemptions will not result in abusive selfdealing or overreaching by affiliated persons of the funds or trust applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  applicants will not register a future fund by means of filing a posteffective amendment to the trusts registration statement or by any other means unless a applicants have requested and received with respect to such future fund either exemptive relief from the

underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the securities act for example a brokerdealer firm andor its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases creation units from a fund breaks them down into the constituent shares and sells those shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares each funds prospectus will state that whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all the facts and circumstances pertaining to that persons activities each funds prospectus also will caution dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution as contrasted to ordinary secondary market trading transactions and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of section c of the securities act that they would be unable to take advantage of the
