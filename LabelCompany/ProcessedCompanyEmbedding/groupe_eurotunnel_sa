completed the partial refinancing of its debt this operation related to the variable rate tranches of the debt and resulted in a reduction of more than bps in the annual cost excluding indexation of the debt taking it below  over the next five years the surplus cash generated by this operation amounting to € million and the annual saving in interest payments of at least € million per year over the next five years strengthen the group’s ability to carry out its development strategy both for the fixed link and eleclink businesses despite relatively stable traffic revenue from shuttle services increased by  for the first half of  compared to the same period in  this improvement is in large part due to the group’s strategy to optimise the profitability of this business through an active yield management policy after growth of  in  the crosschannel truck market in the first half of  was slightly above that of the first half of  having been penalised at the beginning of the year by the impact of the exceptional weather that affected southern europe the group consolidated its truck market share during the period in a context of a strong competitive environment with the return to normal services at the port of calais whilst at the same time strengthening and extending its peakperiod pricing policy in a market for which growth forecasts are below last year the group favours a strategy focused on optimising its margins and the quality of service provided to its customers despite a contraction in the crosschannel car market in the first half of the year the passenger shuttle’s car activity grew its market share to reach record levels during the first half of  the current outlook for the fixed link’s car traffic during the peak summer season indicates that it will be at a similar level as last year in the first half of  passenger traffic on the highspeed trains going through the tunnel continued the growth trend seen at the end of  despite the difficult geopolitical situation and the unfavourable impact of nonrecurring events in the second half of the year this traffic should benefit from the entry into service of new trains on the london to brussels route and from the end of  from the launch of the new direct service to amsterdam crosschannel rail freight which was badly affected by the migrant crisis in  has also continued to recover during the first half of the year with a  growth in traffic at the end of june the group started the construction of a new scanner on the frethun site thus demonstrating its willingness to invest in the security efficiency and growth of this activity the group is continuing with its major capital investment projects aimed at increasing the capacity and the quality of service of its shuttle activity with the entry into service of the first of three new truck shuttles in february  and the inauguration of the new flexiplus lounge on the coquelles terminal in july  this will continue in the second half of the year with the remaining two new truck shuttles entering service in the autumn and the opening of the flexiplus lounge on the folkestone terminal in the first quarter of  a year after the uk’s decision to leave the european union formal negotiations between the british government and the european commission on the conditions and mechanisms of the exit began on  june  during the first half of the year the group did not see any significant impact of this decision on its business but it continues its active monitoring of the situation and its detailed assessment of potential risks that may arise the group remains very confident in the solidity of the fixed link’s economic model the tunnel is and will increasingly assert itself as a major player in the commercial exchanges between the united kingdom and continental europe as regards the europorte segment after the sale of gb railfreight at the end of  the group focused its efforts on increasing the profitability of its rail freight business in france the results of the first half of the year are the fruits of this strategy which the group will continue to pursue showing that it is indeed possible to achieve a healthy development of rail freight in france the group has been the sole shareholder of eleclink since august  and in the first half of  construction works on the  mw interconnector between the uk and the continent started in earnest at  june  the group has invested more than € million in this project which forms part of its strategy to enhance the value of the tunnel infrastructure with work progressing as planned and funding of the project assured the interconnector is expected to be in service at the beginning of  in this context and in light of its firsthalf results the group confirms its financial target for  as published in its  annual report of a consolidated ebitda of € million on the basis of an exchange rate of £€ and the current scope of consolidation this target is based on data assumptions and estimations that are considered reasonable the main risks and uncertainties which the eurotunnel group may face in the remaining six months of the year other than those described

main activities of the group are the design financing construction and operation of the fixed link’s infrastructure and transport system in accordance with the terms of the concession which will expire in  as well as the rail freight activity a important events a partial refinancing of the debt on  june  the group completed the partial refinancing of its debt this operation which related to the c tranches of the term loan the variable rate tranches that were fully hedged by fixed rate interest swaps comprised the refinancing of tranches c and c of the term loan by the issue of three new tranches of debt which are at fixed rates of interest during initial periods and then switch back to variable rates plus margins the partial termination of the corresponding hedging contracts the redemption of the floating rate notes held by the group and the drawing of three new tranches of debt for a total of € million in order to finance the cost of the partial termination of the hedging contracts and the costs of the operation at  june  this operation is reflected in the group’s consolidated financial statements as follows the refinancing of tranches c and c of the term loan which involves a substantial modification to their terms is accounted for as the extinguishment of the existing debt and the recognition of a new financial liability in accordance with ias  the difference between the carrying value of the extinguished debt and the consideration paid corresponding to the unamortised costs of tranches c and c and amounting to € million is recognised in “other financial charges” in the income statement at  june  the new tranches are recorded at their fair value costs of € million which are directly attributable to the issue of the new debt are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying value of the new tranches and are integrated into the effective interest rate of the debt and amortised over its life following the partial termination of the hedging contracts the interest rate derivatives liability in the consolidated balance sheet is reduced by € million corresponding to the share of the fair value of these partially terminated instruments this amount previously recognised in equity will be recycled to the income statement over the periods of suspension of the hedging contracts the difference between this amount and the consideration for the termination of the contracts being a net amount of € million corresponding to the rebates negotiated with the counterparties less associated costs is recognised in “other financial income” the redemption of the floating rate notes held by the group and which were previously accounted for as “other financial assets” generated a profit of € million which was recognised in the income statement

to the value of the minimum payments receivable in accordance with ias  on  june  the eurotunnel group exercised the put option and on  june  completed the sale of the two ferries to dfds as for the price set out in the agreement made in june  this transaction from which the group received € million is treated in the consolidated financial statements at  june  in accordance with ias  as indicated above as a settlement of the lease receivable accounted for under “other financial assets” and an income of € million has been recognised in the result from discontinued operations during this transaction dfds notified the eurotunnel group that it disagrees with the option exercise price the price paid by dfds in relation to the exercise of the option corresponds to the terms of the agreement concluded between the parties in june  on  may  the group concluded an agreement with vansea shipping company limited for the nordpasdecalais since renamed al andalus express which provided initially for its lease with an option for its subsequent sale the option was exercised by the group on  july  and the sale of the ferry was completed on  july  ii litigation and disputes as indicated

consistent in all significant aspects with those used for get se’s  annual consolidated financial statements i texts adopted by the european union whose application is compulsory the texts adopted by the european union the application of which is compulsory for financial years beginning on or after  january  are as follows amendments to ias  “defined benefit plans employee contributions”

with customers” which is mandatory from  january  the associated amendments subject to their adoption by the european union will be applicable on the same date as ifrs  the group does not intend to apply these provisions in advance the groups analysis of products and contracts with customers in its various activities did not identify any significant impact of the application of this standard in the consolidated financial statements as set out in note d to get se’s financial statements as at  december  sales are recognised in revenue when the customer uses the services for the truck shuttle activity revenue is recognised when the crossing is made for the passenger shuttle activity when the reservation is made the tickets are recorded in “deferred income” then the revenue is recognised when the crossing has been made for the railway network passenger and rail freight tolls revenue is recognised when the crossing has been made for the railway network’s annual fixed charges and contributions to the group’s operating and investment costs revenue is recognised as a function of the provision of the fixed link’s capacity for europorte’s rail transport activity revenue corresponds to sales of transport services and sales are recognised in revenue when the service is actually performed for the maintenance and management of railway infrastructure sales are recognised in revenue as and when the services are actually performed ifrs  “financial instruments” “ifrs   financial instruments” issued by the iasb in july  and adopted by the eu on  november  will replace ias  “financial instruments” as of  january  this new standard defines new principles for the classification and measurement of financial instruments impairment for credit risk on financial assets and hedge accounting the group does not intend to apply this provision in advance the analysis carried out by the group on the first application of this new standard is in progress and has not identified any significant potential impact on its consolidated financial statements the group will finalise this work during the second half of  iii other texts and amendments published by the iasb but not approved by the european union the following texts concerning accounting rules and methods specifically applied by the group have not yet been approved by the european union ifrs  “leases” amendments

shortterm leases and those of lowvalue assets must be recognised in the lessees statement of financial position in the form of a right of use asset and a financial liability to date leases classified as “simple” are presented offbalance sheet the potential impact of these other texts will be assessed by the group in subsequent years b use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position as well as the amount of revenue and expenses during the period the group’s management and the board of directors periodically review the valuations and estimates based on experience and other factors considered relevant for the determination of a reasonable and appropriate valuation of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position accordingly the estimates underlying the preparation of halfyear consolidated financial statements to  june  have been established in the context of the decision by the uk to leave the european union as described in note a above depending on the evolution of these assumptions the actual figures may differ from current estimates the use of estimations concerns mainly the valuation of fixed assets see note f evaluation of the groups deferred tax position see note i and some elements of valuation of financial assets and liabilities see note g b seasonal variations the revenue and the trading result generated in each reporting period are subject to seasonal variations over the year in

substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in france and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit accordingly we do not express an audit opinion based on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed halfyear consolidated financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with ias   standard of the ifrss as adopted by the european union applicable
