benefits of conexant marvell deals rick bergman head of synaptics which makes many products for the human interface of computing such as chips to control track pads and fingerprint identification talks with tech trader about the multiple benefits of buying two leaders in voiceactivation and video by tiernan ray updated june    pm et text size regular medium large following an announcement this afternoon by touchsensor controller giant synaptics syna of two chip technology businesses chief executive rick bergman was kind enough to take a few minutes by phone to talk with me about the importance of the deals and also about the company’s revised outlook for the current quarter ending this month the subject of the announcement was the company’s buying privately held conexant systems for  million in cash plus synaptics stock as well as the “multimedia solutions” business of chip maker marvell technology group mrvl for  million in cash bergman said the company had “timed things very well” to take advantage of the coming of age of voice technology clearly voice has turned the corner we are happy we picked up a leaders here in amazon’s amzn echo reference design conexant is the company they recommend for  and microphone solutions and they have a host of design wins that are coming to market in the case of marvell they have a very strong position in the home with personal assistants and settops and other devices i asked if these deals were buy versus build” as they say said bergman we have been on the ma side as a way to enter markets” historically in the case of audio it’s pretty specialized” he added it would be pretty difficult to build this on our own i asked bergman if there is any intellectual property that comes along with the purchases that the company can conceivably license more broadly there is a small stream for software yes that conexant sells and we will continue to pursue that it certainly helps out with gross margin and maybe helps to pursue other markets synaptics cut its outlook for this quarter’s revenue slightly from its last forecast “it was a whisker” notes bergman just  different “we felt it would be appropriate given that we are coming to the end our quarter said bergman “the smartphone market in china in particular is a bit slow now as there is a bit of inventory correction” that includes both slower demand for actual phones and a few of our customers have seen lower demand” for the components they source from synaptics i also asked bergman about the socalled trifecta that is the term that has been given to the company’s intention to combine three things touch sensing display controllers and fingerprint recognition into a single product expected some time next year bergman was upbeat about the promise of the trifecta when i last interviewed him in april and some bulls on the stock such as columbia seligman’s paul wick are very enthusiastic about the potential bergman tells me that voice and video is just another way to go and work with them” — meaning his customers who would already be interested in something like the trifecta but at the same time the voice is a form of authentication” he notes and you can use voice with the same algorithmic approach” as fingerprint recognition “its surprisingly similar” he says it’s possible for synaptics to offer technologies to do both fingerprint and voice where voice becomes a type of persistent authentication” that augments what is done periodically with detecting fingerprints that approach called “multiple modalities” is a great way to make security of the device extremely high basically a multiplication of your security synaptics shares are down  or  at  in afterhours trading text size regular medium large chips ma semiconductor global

drastically improve the user interface experience our announced partnership with shanghai based oxi technology accelerated this goal and enables a significant time to market advantage teaming with auxi also quickly expands our china presence in our time critical customer support network we also had the opportunity to demonstrate our organically built in display optical fingerprint sensor solution where our innovation eliminates the phone bezel altogether and enables the smartphone holy grail of edgetoedge top to bottom infinity displays this exciting solution is expected for mass production in the second half of calendar  the initial solution will be in a fixed position in the display optical wasnt the only innovation arising from our biometrics team as we also introduced our multifactor fusion engine multifactor biometric simultaneously enhances user convenience and increases security it allows our customers to have a more secured seamless user experience and our ecosystem partners such as banks to differentiate by enabling multiple biometric mode settings for specific use cases our initial build is focused on facial recognition tied to fingerprint as the hardware for face biometric is already present on mobile devices next generation software release is planned to include other modes of biometrics in regards to new fingerprint design wins in the quarter we continue to bolster our market position and driver fingerprint solutions further into our product lines asus selected our fingerprint solutions for its innovative zen phone ar smartphone with google tango and also its flagship zen pad s tablet lenova selected us for its new flagship vibe p smartphone and huawei is featuring synaptics fingerprint sensor on its new changxiang s the huawei s phone is also an industry first triple play a fingerprint touch and display from a single provider the fact that we won all three opportunities in a high profile phone from top oems speaks to our unique competitive advantage and our leadership in the market huawei also selected synaptics touch view tddi solution for its mate  smartphones underscoring the solid traction of touch and display driver integration weve seen over the past few quarters clearly  mark the emergence in market acceptance of tddi we expect the significant rate of tddi adoption to continue in smartphones and by  tddi are expected to be the majority solution for lcd based displays our tddi roadmap over the next couple of years is broad based encompasses both next generation solutions at the high end to support infinity display phones and virtual reality as well as cost efficient solutions to serve the expanding lower end of the market which is key to maintaining our significant market share and improving gross margins over time weve also begun to architect our first oled tddi chip for the market which we expect to debut late in calendar  with around  market share today synaptics is a number one player in tddi and we are well poised to maintain that status going forward we are also very well pleased during the quarter to announce our first display driver solution for oled based smartphones this feature rich solution includes our best in class imaging processing a new state of the art display technology specifically designed to enhance oled displays this includes flexible digital gamma control for smooth dimming local area acl for high contrast text high accuracy color enhancement and support for high dynamic or hdr these features combined a superior display in virtual reality experience on oled smartphones we now have engineering samples of this solution and are working with our strategic parter display manufactures to bring up their panels over the coming months we are planning to be ready for production by the end of this calendar year in time for when we expect the broader industries oled display capacity to meaningfully ramp starting in  with regards to touch one of our major wins during the quarter was with google where our latest flagship discreet touch controls are featured in a new google pixel and google pixel excel smartphone as far our notebook pc business we remain the market cheerleader and achieve strong growth in the quarter as a result of increased attach rate of our secured pad and fingerprint sensor technologies new this quarter toshiba launched its dynabook featuring our secured pad and hp launched its elite slice featuring our fingerprint solution we also partnered with two leading peripheral companies kensington and pqi to add fingerprint sensors to usb dongles this allows any windows  pc to add one touch biometric security in addition synaptics unique touch pad feature such as moisture resistant and gloved operation are enabling pc adoption in new vertical market such as medical military and industrial we expect continued momentum in our notebook pc business lastly lets touch on auto where our demos at ces have garnered a significant amount of interest we expect to see a growing number of opportunities in this area leveraging a touch display and fingerprint solutions today automotive revenue makes up about  to  of total revenue involved the design cycles along we have a solid pipeline of design wins for upcoming model years and expect this revenue stream to grow nicely over time ultimately we believe that auto is an important diversification in growth lever for synaptics as we enter the second half of our fiscal year we are pleased with the way our forecast is tracking and with the revenue range that wajid will outline for the fiscal third quarter which encompasses the natural seasonality of our display driver business based on this outlook it is reasonable to project that fiscal  revenue will likely be up slightly as opposed to our prior projections of flat versus the prior year in summary the investments weve made in strong growth areas including tddi and fingerprint are paying off and we should continue to gain momentum moving forward strengthening our market leading position and helping to offset the expected yearoveryear decline in ddic revenue our recent design win momentum has broadened our global customer base particularly in china and reduced our dependency on a narrow set of customers we are making bold moves as demonstrated by our partnership with oxi to ensure that we stay ahead of industry inflection points while also further strengthening our position in important growth region such as china we are on track to become a formidable player within the expanding oled display market and are well on path to achieving the ultimate integration of our touch display and fingerprint technologies with that ill now handed it over to wajid wajid ali thanks rick revenue for the december quarter was  million above the midpoint of our guidance range and up  sequentially yearoveryear december quarter revenue declined  primarily reflecting lower demand for our display driver solutions largely offset by increased demand for tddi products during the quarter we had five customers at or above the  revenue threshold ranging from  to  revenue mix from mobile and pc products was approximately  and  respectively revenue from mobile products was up  sequentially and down  compared with the year ago quarter revenue from pc products was up  sequentially and  yearoveryear i will now provide a highlevel review of certain of our december quarter gaap results and will follow with the corresponding nongaap results for the december quarter our gaap gross margin was  which includes  million of intangible asset amortization and  of sharebased compensation costs gaap operating expenses in the december quarter were  million which includes sharebased compensation of  million restructuring costs of  million consisting primarily of office based consolidation charges and acquisitionrelated costs of  million consisting of intangibles amortization this resulted in gaap operating profit of  of revenue for the quarter in the december quarter we had gaap net income of  million or  per diluted share now turning to certain of our december quarter nongaap results our december quarter nongaap gross margin of  primarily reflects our overall product mix december quarter nongaap operating expenses came in at  million down  million from the preceding quarter the decline primarily reflects costsaving actions initiated in the prior and current quarter and further resulted in nongaap operating profit of  of revenue our nongaap tax rate was approximately  for the quarter and  for the first half of the fiscal year the impact of reducing the yeartodate nongaap tax rate resulted in  improvement in nongaap net income per share for the quarter nongaap net income for the december quarter was  million or  per diluted share representing a  sequential increase but down  yearoveryear turning to our balance sheet we ended the quarter with  million of cash an increase of  million from the preceding quarter the increase in cash during the quarter was primarily related to cash flow from operations of  million receivables at the end of december were  million and dsos were  days reflecting a front end loaded quarter while inventories were  million and inventory turns were  million capital expenditures for the quarter were  million and depreciation was  million now i will make a few comments regarding our quarterly outlook based on our backlog of approximately  million entering the march quarter subsequent bookings customer forecasts product sellin and sellthrough timing patterns as well as expected product mix we anticipate revenue for the march quarter to be in the range of  million to  million we expect the revenue mix for mobile and pc products in the march quarter to be approximately  and  respectively i will now provide gaap outlook data for our march quarter and will follow with nongaap outlook data we anticipate the stockbased compensation charge in the third quarter to be in the range of  million to  million gaap expenses in the march quarter are expected to include additional restructuring costs in the range of  to  consisting primarily of severance costs in addition march quarter gaap expenses are expected to include noncash charges of approximately  million for intangibles amortization of which approximately  million will be reflected in cost of sales i will now provide nongaap outlook data for our march quarter taking into account our overall revenue mix we expect nongaap gross margin in the march quarter to be between  to  we expect nongaap operating expenses in the march quarter to be in the range of approximately  million to  million using the midpoint of our q guidance nongaap operating profit would be approximately  of revenue we anticipate our nongaap longterm liability based tax rate for q to be in the range of  to nongaap net income per diluted share for the march quarter is anticipated to be in the range of  to  per share in closing based on our solid first half results and current outlook for the third quarter we are pleased with the way the first nine months of the year are shaping up as we continue to capitalize on a positive trends within our business with that we will now turn the call over to the operator to start the qa session operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and well take our first question from paul coster with jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open paul coster yes thank you so i think probably mostly people are focused on the gross margins at least those little bit skeptical here and clearly the trajectory is going to be in terms of recovery is going to be slow if there is a recovery it is also  perhaps you can just talk us through maybe a little longer term if you like how you see the gross margin shaping up with mix with cost sounds and with volume on the tddi side thank you wajid ali hi paul its wajid ali ill start off and ill let rick add in a couple of comments so at the analyst day we presented our nearterm model for gross margins and operating margins and i think we were pretty transparent about the fact that given our product mix and the way our product roadmap was looking that it would take a few quarters for us to move the needle up on both gross margins and on operating margins as our revenue is expected to increase over time and so nothing really changed between then and now in terms of our thesis of around how gross margins will improve it will really be based on product roadmap and things like cost savings and manufacturing savings the teams are continuously working on those and in a business like ours there is a number of pluses and minuses that happen that will kind of get you to the range the target range that weve talked about rick bergman paul i think wajid kind of hit on the key points and as we said we are committed to be a full range supplier that might be little different than what we did with the discreet touch where we are willing to exit certain parts of low end of the market but with the phone market specifically there is so much to the volume now is in low to mid range so we are detecting solutions for that particular market getting the volume and driving that top line as we go further for several reasons that you can imagine ultimately its margin dollars or operating profit and eps that should drive the company and in second we dont want to give up a lot of room for our competitors to operate and so in this fashion its whether tddi or fingerprint as i said we are committed to be in a full line supplier paul coster all right good and then on tddi front you are now basically committing to be in the game for oled as well can you kind of give us some sense and timeline there and also what the margin outlook would be for that business would it be much different from the incumbency tddi business rick bergman sure great question paul i think if you look back and ask me that question a year ago id have answered it well we are not quite sure how well add value with tddi on oled but well find a way and over the last  months our researchers and architects have found way that we think can make tddi compelling and so now we are out there beginning the architecture and development of those parts and working with our panel partners to realize that vision and as we said in prepared remarks our where we see that more towards being in mass production towards the end of calendar  in terms of the gross margin profile of course one affects specifically on display driver is today  we are not going to be a mass production with oled drivers until the end of the year that effectively means we are not planning a big chunk of the high end market now whether with us our rsv previously in terms of ddic business thats where the high margin business tends to reside so as we look forward certainly it is our hope with oled and tddi oled that we will be by definition the higher end of the market and that should enable the opportunity to enjoy little higher margins there operator thank you and well take our next question from rob stone with cowen  co please go ahead your line is open rob stone hi you mentioned in the prepared remarks you are now thinking the full fiscal year up slightly versus flattish in your prior guidance i think at the analyst day you also suggested that you thought although the march quarter would be down with the normal seasonality that the june quarter directionally is likely to be up from there is that still the case on sort of direction for the june quarter rick bergman well thanks for the question rob if you remember beginning of fiscal year we were quite reluctant to get a whole lot of forward looking guidance and the scars from a year ago havent totally healed because of the nature we can do our best job at the end of the day it ultimately comes down to the sell through of some of our customers now we continue to diversify that customer base in very skus where and so on but there is still some big hitters that we have so in terms of getting a lot of clarity for the quarter plus one or beyond we arent really going to provide a lot of that other than to make you just go with the remarks and what other pattern that we made either today or in the past rob stone okay i wanted to drill into the tddi a little bit more in my follow up question you have a range of chips already released that stand different resolutions and in general higher resolution ddic or tddi should command a higher sp and presumably maybe little bit better margin can you say of the chips youve announced sort of how many are in chipping design win by now or what proportionally is much or all of the volumes still coming from the lowest end of resolution on tddi rick bergman well i guess i dont want to breakdown our percent for device but still the majority of our shipments today are in hd segment which is lower end  to the part i think i mentioned that maybe at one of the meetings we had in the past now if we look at the market trends clearly full hd is coming on very quickly as well and would certainly have expectation lot of that volume will shift from a broader context it is one of the things that we havent really seen as lot of the high resolution lcd panels end up i think its partly due to the oled trend that i was mentioning so if we compare to a maybe a year ago or year and half ago when we defined these parts particularly the  is wqhd volume in that particular part have been disappointing and of course that would be the higher resolution for the higher end lcd market operator thank you and we will take our next question from kevin cassidy with stifel please go ahead your line is open john donley hi this is john donley on for kevin thanks for taking question i was wondering could you give us a update on what you are seeing in china and what kind of revenue contribution you are getting from there wajid ali sorry could you just repeat the question rick bergman so the trends in china kind of more broadly from a market perspective the market pretty much played out in technical difficulty and our fiscal q is as expected the pc market might have been a little stronger i think the china smartphone market might have been a hair stronger than we initially thought when all things rolled out but the great news is couple of the oems there is doing really well and we had long term historic relationships with them when they are much smaller companies so in some ways we are pleased with those trends there is a bit of consolidation going on synaptics is tended to pay for the larger oem just in terms of our support structure and strategic relationships and with those consolidations some of the white box phones are clearly losing share so that trend is certainly positive for us and now lets wajid talk about the percent of revenue in china for this past quarter wajid ali yes i mean it has been growing over the quarters last year this time we were doing just a little north of  of revenue being in china last quarter we were over  of our revenue was based in china and that had actually trended up nicely from our fiscal q john donley okay great do you guys expect any change in the fingerprint sensor margin as those ramps up in the second half of the year and do the optical sensors impact that rick bergman sure john just a couple of kind broad comments on that so as i had mentioned to paul we do plan to play in the full spectrum of that marketplace now up to now for the most part weve been in samsung phones and there has been high end samsung phones the galaxy and then prior to that note series of phones and a few other high end phones as an example the huawei phone that i mentioned the s thats more of a mainstream phone at the selling price is roughly us  thats a very high volume its call i dont know if you call low ended more mid range type of phone but the price points and some of the gross margin pressure comes with that volume there so there is call that pressure and as we look into optical we see that more the higher end solution and that could help us the other direction in terms of gross margin percentage but for the latter case the optical solutions think of that more second half in the calendar year operator thank you and we will take our next question from john vinh with pacific crest please go ahead your line is open john vinh hi thanks for taking my question my first question is can you talk a little bit more about your gotomarket strategy with the optical and display fingerprint sensor are you anticipating that youll bring the product to market with multiple customers or similar to how you brought fingerprint sensor in market are you planning on coming in market with one of your key flagship customers first and if thats the case are you anticipating that you could have any sort of exclusivity arrangements with any of your customers rick bergman well john this is rick we have a range of optical solutions now and call it each of them have their own path market now historically independent what products we done whether its touch tddi or whatever we just naturally i think we and any supplier youll tend to zero in a smaller setup customers because invariably you are working out kings out of the product and your support organization is only so big and then you bring out to a broader set thats what we do kind of across all of our products we kind of have an alpha customer and then what we do is what we call our platform release which means we have the supports tools and infrastructure in place for a broader set of customers that will be our plan on the optical in terms of any special arrangements with any customers i cant comment at this time john vinh great and then my follow up is for wajid you at the analyst day had talked about that you are considering taking on maybe some lower margin fingerprint sensing business in china that you felt was accretive to your earnings and operating profit can you talk about whether thats reflected in your march quarter guidance or not wajid ali john it was more of a longer term statement and longer than actually q so no none of that business that we were talking about is actually reflected in our q guidance operator thank you and well take our next question from charlie anderson with dougherty  co please go ahead your line is open charlie anderson yes thanks for taking my question and i guess just considering you are talking rick how you burn last year i think there was sort of over buy situation just snapshot in time how are you feeling about things right now in terms of inventories out of the customers and how things looks are they healthy in your perspective in your mind rick bergman again great question charlie and yes our radar is high as they can be in terms of monitoring our customers inventory in terms of what they have in our part and what we here in the channel now that being said we dont have great visibility on what phone inventory may or may not be out there but i think kind of across the board is i talked to our oem customers they feel reasonably good that it call its normal channel inventory they are certainly things that maybe a little lean at some point towards its tail end in the last year due to some component shortages from various folks and then of course last year was the other way as you stated but right now it feels that there is ever such a thing in a phone market normal charlie anderson great and then for my follow up you mentioned having the oled display driver kind of very late this year and then oled tddi maybe kind of late  so i wondered if you just kind of walk us through the progression there are these both for the flagship line or they targeted different portions of the market how do you see that playing up for you guys rick bergman well in general oled tend to be a more expensive solution even if we when you look through  just due to the inherent costs and yields involved with oled screen so we see our oled solutions being mid range to high end especially initially and of course as we look into  where the supply becomes much more plentiful for many players well adopt our architectures to be competitive thats for mid range devices operator thank you and well take our next question from vijay rakesh with mizuho please go ahead your line is open vijay rakesh hi guys thanks good quarter and guidance just i was wondering if you look at your margins and sort of beat on that is it fair to assume that this trough and as you look at second half the fingerprint sensing and some of the other ramps margin should start to improve wajid ali so vijay its wajid even out of margin model for the near term and the mid term we think that the next couple of quarters are going to fall into the near term margin model of  to  everything we see in front of us from a product mix standpoint and from a customer engagement standpoint point to that they continue to point to that so thats kind of where we are seeing it right now vijay rakesh all right and then on the oled driver ic and tddi side can you give us some directionality of how the sp of oled driver ddic trend versus oled driver ic trend versus your ddic today and how is it the tddi looked that to end and how do the margins compare and when do you see revenues in oled  is that for the september quarter kind of timeframe thanks rick bergman okay ill give a shot and please let me know if i didnt miss or i miss part to your question ill now start at the end first so in terms of revenue we said think of more towards the end of the calendar year as opposed to the september quarter and as we talk about previously where some outdated by the display manufactures as well our devices are now sampling in and we feel highly confident that we can meet that schedule but that means they have to be able to be ramp up there oled lines and incorporate our solutions and test them out and that can be a longer process in terms of margin is one of the prior questions i mentioned that we do have expectation that our oled driver should be able to on the higher side for display drivers because this is naturally over the next couple of years there will be higher end or lowest to mid range solutions and margin is naturally kind of gone that way with the ddic family in terms of tddi or you are asking our gross margin there it is a little bit below corporate averages at this juncture but again as a factor of as i mentioned lot of our shipments now are in hd resolution segment which is clearly in a lower part of the market and margins just as i mentioned on oled side it is kind of the flip side of that that will be little tougher there operator thank you and we will take our next question from rajvindra gill with needham  co please go ahead your line is open rajvindra gill thank you and congrats on good results rick just a technical question so that the product roadmap for your oled tddi solution i wanted to get a sense if are there going to be any difficulty doing oled tddi versus the lcd tddi it does seem like oled has the same tt transistor back lane so not necessarily would lend itself to some problem but maybe you could talk a little about that some of the technical challenges of doing maybe on sale oled tddi versus an out sale oled solution rick bergman raj it kind of goes back to my earlier comments on we would find a way to have a compelling architecture for tddi because there are really smart guys here figured it out so obviously dont want to explain what that is on the phone now because its taken us a year and i just leave it that there is certain parts of the market and segment and technology where we think our unique knowledge of touch and display drivers will enable us to deliver a very performance as well as cost effective solution kind of more generally one of the challenges is we had with lcds was the changing of the manufacturing process that was required to support in sell the industry is much more open to our idea this time around with touch so assuming we can get a few of the manufacturers onboard i would expect adoption rate to actually be pretty good although we are still two or three years away from that kind of turning point that we just saw last year in lcd rajvindra gill great understood my follow up question is around your oled display driver contraction obviously you are tied to the hip with the other oled panel makers or the other panel makers who are ramping oled capacity outside of samsung display i wanted to get a sense of how are they tracking in terms of building out oled panels you talked about kind of an inflection heading into calendar  any thoughts around the whole oled ecosystem developing and how do you see the competitive landscape in oled driver going forward thank you rick bergman okay the first part of that question i guess i would urge you to go look at our slides from december  i think we outlined the trends there in terms of adoption of oled in the industry from a number of panels perspective probably better than i can do verbally over the phone here since at that time things are tracking ahead i am sure everybody noticed just tremendous investment in rd and capital into making the oled transition hard so thats counter balance but its just something very difficult to manufacture so i am confident there will be a number of suppliers out there ramping in the  timeframe in terms of the competitive landscape we are seeing call the usual suspects out there in terms of who we would expect to see and well bring the same value that we brought to the lcd market innovation and some key technology advantage that we think we can uniquely provide and to a certain degree thats why we are able to be embraced by the display manufacturers as we go out there with our oled tddi and ddic plans operator thank you we will take our next question from jagadish iyer with summit redstone partners please go ahead your line is open jagadish iyer yes thanks so much for taking my question two questions for rick first you talked about being a single supplier to huawei i was just wondering i wanted to get your thoughts on how some of the other chinese handset makers are thinking about conversing to a single supplier solution here then i have a follow up rick bergman i presume you are talking about fingerprint sensors just to be clear i didnt say we are the only supplier at huawei jagadish iyer no i mean being providing all the three products to the  just like the huawei rick bergman okay sorry i misunderstood your question so certainly we bring that value proposition to all of our customers based out there and fortunately we are seeing more and more tddi adoption that being said it typically is different decisions at this point you will have a decision made around the display which of course is touch and ddic or tddi and then in other decision around what fingerprint solution to be made now of course we strategically get more aligned with the customer base and over time as we keep hitting in our prepared remarks we see opportunities whether be architectural benefit as well but we are not prepared to talk about that at this time jagadish iyer and as a follow up you talked about the strength in tddi in terms of how you are able to ramp sequentially i was just wondering is there any as we look out over the next four to eight quarters do you think is there any seasonality with regard to tddi thank you rick bergman well right now we are enjoying the ramp in adoption or call it attach rate curve on tddi that somewhat washes out the natural seasonality but in a few quarters from now tddi will have a very significant chunk of the overall lcd display market and at that point of course seasonality will begin to kickin just like with any display technology operator thank you and we will take our next question from martin latif with arete research please go ahead your line is open martin latif good afternoon my first question is can you give us an indication of rsv revenues in the quarter excluding tddi and how do you expect this trend over next few quarters wajid ali yes martin thats something that we dont breakout any more martin latif okay and my second question is on tddi gross margin you just mentioned that they are little bit below corporate average i was just wondering if there is any scope for cost reductions and what geometry are you using for tddi manufacturing process rick bergman id just add here in a little bit on your additional now your first comment or question the one thing we did mention in our prepared remarks is that our tddi revenue was down quite a bit yearoveryear so just i guess reinforce that for a minute because fortunately other parts of our business such as the tddi and fingerprint have filled that lower revenue in terms of nodes and so on that we are using for our tddi our highest volume is in the  nanometer geometry we also have solutions in  nanometer and then some older product in  nanometer as well as we look forward i guess i dont want to kind of show our hands but well move into more advanced geometry as going forward well continue to leverage some of the older geometries due to just lower system cost operator thank you and we have no further questions id like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any additional or closing remarks rick bergman okay thank you everybody for participating we tended to have a shorter call i guess because we saw lot of you over couple of times over the last two months and hopefully things were straightforward thank you very much and we look forward to talking to everybody in the april timeframe operator thank you and this does conclude todays program thank you for your participation
