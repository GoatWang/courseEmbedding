canon communications llc publication devicelinkcommx c over story growing with a difference for a startup medical device operation to compete effectively in a mature product sector dominated by established industry giants the company must have not only a promising technology base but also experienced executives who know how to maximize market penetration under the leadership of chairman and ceo alexis v lukianov nuvasive inc san diego has both founded with the vision of redefining the minimally invasive spine surgery market nuvasive s evolution from a niche player to a noteworthy competitor in the spine sector was especially evident during during the year nuvasive generated total annual revenues of  million representing a yearoveryear increase of  further the company launched nine new products and was able to initiate enrollment for its neodisc clinical trial ahead of schedule the company also surpassed its goals for training surgeons and developing an exclusive sales force during  nuvasive trained more than  surgeons on its maximum access surgery mas platform and grew its sales force to more than  professionals throughout  nuvasive plans to continue its rapid pace of revenue growth and technology development the company is forecasting yearoveryear revenue growth of greater than  and expects to turn the corner into profitability this year the company also plans to increase the breadth and depth of its existing product offerings through a series of strategic launches in this excerpted interview with mx editorinchief steve halasey lukianov discusses his company s strategy for growing into a strong competitor in medtech s heated spine sector the full text of the interview can be accessed via the mx web site at mx how did nuvasive get its start alexis v lukianov nuvasive was founded by a local orthopedic surgeon who was not an expert in the spine arena he actually had more of a background in sports medicine he came up with the concept of marrying neurophysiology together with spinal instrumentation and basically what that means is he came up with the idea of how to make instruments smart so that they can detect nerves and safely penetrate the pathology the surgeon was able to obtain some initial seed funding from a local venture capitalist vc who represented enterprise partners that came about literally as the result of a conversation during a kids soccer match after hearing about the concept the vc decided to provide some seed capital enterprise partners had done a lot of deals with kleiner perkins so they brought that firm into the deal as well and that finally was what led to my involvement with the company i was recruited to come here by kleiner perkins where were you at the time i had previously been president of medtronic sofamor danek usa for several years when i left the company i had a threeyear noncompete agreement that prevented me from being active in spine devices in particular so i started a small company in the physician practice management arena that was focused on spine surgeries which i subsequently sold to a robert bass company around the time that my noncompete agreement came to an end i started getting phone calls from a number of different companies and their headhunters and that s when most notably the kleiner perkins photo by michael spengler nuvasive s alexis v lukianov on building a new competitor in medtech s heated spine sector interview by steve halasey cover story opportunity came around in terms of its intellectual property strengths and market potential how was nuvasive presented to you such that you became convinced that this was your next opportunity the entire concept was extremely novel nobody else was thinking about anything like the marriage of neurophysiology with instruments that nuvasive was proposing on the ip side they had done some pretty good work in obtaining freedomtooperate opinions and they had put together some preliminary patents the whole package looked very encouraging and what was exciting was not just the marriage of neurophysiology with instruments but the possibility that this approach could bring about the next eureka point in the spine world that is a way to bring forward minimally invasive spinal surgery which had not previously really taken off i had previously been involved with mostly larger companies and of course i helped to build medtronic sofamor danek and drive that company to a numberone market share now it s the world s largest spine company and an active competitor for nuvasive ultimately what attracted me to the kleiner perkins offer was the opportunity to build the company from the ground up as a true startup and to take it to whatever level i could for me that seemed like a terrific opportunity a chance to build a company from a cultural philosophical and ideological standpoint the way that i really wanted to do it what was the trigger for nuvasive deciding to go public in may of  the thing that every company worries about as it goes public is the possibility of disappointing investors as we went public we were still on somewhat wobbly legs just as most companies are when they are going through normal growingpains issues but frankly i felt that we were in a good enough position to be able to put forward the kind of revenue that people expected from us as nuvasive has grown how did you go about building your executive team to flesh out the company most of the key executives i brought over were people from medtronic sofamor danek and others i ve known and worked with in the past and i think that i was able to demonstrate to them that my dream and vision were probably no different than theirs in terms of being able to build the company the way we would all enjoy seeing it come together so what brought these executives on board was an understanding that product pipeline nuvasive is constantly seeking to further its penetration of the minimally invasive spine surgery marketplace introducing differentiated products is instrumental to this initiative by increasing product breadth nuvasive can increase its penetration into a spine surgeon s business by moving further up the spine into cervical thoracolumbar and adult degenerative scoliosis cases the evolution of the nuvasive product suite has enabled the company to become a onestop shop for spinal pathologies addressing more than  of potential spine surgeon business in  nuvasive launched nine products including the maxcess iii building on the company s previous systems maxcess iii uses a splitblade design that enables surgeons to gain maximum access to the spine with minimal softtissue damage and incorporates the company s neurovision nerve avoidance technology within the posterior retraction blade maxcess iii adds a removable fourth blade which provides greater posterior surgical options and incorporates an improved tilted bladelocking mechanism nuvasive plans several launches in these launches will focus on nuvasive s maximum access surgery mas platform to further increase implant choices through its unique surgical access for lumbar surgery while also increasing the breadth of the company s cervical and motion preservation product offerings the technology had promise but more important was the belief that we could build a topnotch team with the kind of culture that would take us wherever we set our sights on going the spinal product pipeline tell me about the core products and procedures that nuvasive was founded on and how the company has expanded on that base over the years minimally invasive surgery had never really taken off in the spine world and the reason is that it was technically very challenging it had been difficult to provide spine surgeons with a safe and reproducible technique that could be performed by the masses of surgeons nuvasive s approach of marrying neurophysiology with spinal instru mentation creating smart instruments that enable the surgeon to navigate down to the spine opened up a whole new surgical technique that surgical technique entails being able to come at the spine from the side versus the traditional approaches which are from the back posterior or from the front anterior directions coming in from the side with nuvasive s smart instruments the neurovision and neuronavigational technology enables the surgeon to penetrate to the point of the spinal pathology very quickly the next steps make use of an entire suite of nuvasive products designed to prepare the surgical site for a standard fusion procedure this procedure stops the motion in between the vertebral bodies which is creating pain and relieves pressure on the nerves which causes the pain the spinal fusion procedure is widely used today for patients that have chronic back pain that has not been resolved by any other means in creating its new surgical technique nuvasive relied on intelligent engineering and significant input from spine surgeons and those surgeons have been equally excited about the technology and its potential for addressing an area of unmet need in spine surgery the technique enables surgeons to perform a fusion procedure  faster than before and it permits patients to recover virtually on the same day and so far as ambulation is concerned even within hours after surgery and of course because the technique is significantly faster it also ends up saving money for the operating room so it s a hugely significant advance in spine surgery and along the way the surgical technique is reproducible by the masses of spine surgeons is that correct yes and that s a key feature to make this possible we conduct surgeon training here at our own facility where we have six operating rooms equipped for cadaver surgeries surgeons come here for training which usually takes just one day and during that time they are exposed to the technology and shown how to apply the surgical technique in our experience after surgeons leave here and head home to apply the technology they get the exact same results as surgeons that have been doing the procedure for the past several years so there really is not a lengthy learning curve once trained in creating its new surgical technique nuvasive relied on intelligent engineering and significant input from spine surgeons the surgeons are able to perform the surgery and help their patients right away and they get positive results immediately right out of the chute you alluded to nuvasive s interest in nonfusion techniques can you talk a bit about how that is developing in developing nuvasive s unique minimally invasive way of accessing the spine we also realized that we were really providing just a part of the procedure so about four years ago we changed our strategy to make sure that we provided the entire technique and all of the instrumentation to go with it since then we ve come up with a wide range of instruments for performing spinal procedures including unique forms of retraction and all the different types and sizes of preparation instruments that surgeons need the whole array would literally cover a large conference table so we ve taken a very comprehensive approach instead of just offering a couple of instruments taking such a comprehensive perspective has enabled nuvasive to achieve a strong position among the top companies in the field even though we are not that big from a market share standpoint surgeons appreciate that we offer a full scope of products just like the larger companies at the same time we ve also been designing more and more products to put through our unique access channels these have included different types and styles of implants implants that enable the fusion procedure to work even better and faster and so on most recently we ve also begun to develop motion preservation products that can be implanted using nuvasive s minimally invasive approach and the resulting access channels the idea is to use the company s approach which we call maximum access surgery to enable surgeons to implant a lumbar total disk replacement or even to work on a patient s neck right now we are conducting us clinical trials of a product called neodisc which is a nucleuslike total disk replacement the product consists of a silicone core with embroidery material around it and it is really intended to replace just the core of the disk over the next several months we expect to start clinical studies for two other products the first is the cer pass device which is another type of motionpreserving implant for the neck using a ceramiconceramic design and the second product is the lateral total disk replacement for the lumbar spine cover story nuvasive acquired the neodisc product last year from pearsalls ltd taunton uk how many people are enrolled in the clinical trials for the device and what is the status of approaching profitability nuvasive s guidance for fullyear  revenues is between  million and  million which would represent growth of more than  over  revenues and perhaps even more significantly the company expects to tip over into profitability during the year in  nuvasive experienced yearoveryear revenue growth of  for fullyear  the company reported a net loss of  million on revenues of  million during the year the company also completed its transition to an exclusive sales force a move that has led to increased vertical integration of hospitals using nuvasive products the strategy of bringing to market differentiated products to further our penetration of the minimally invasive spine surgery marketplace has and will continue to be a key initiative for nuvasive said nuvasive chairman and ceo alexis v lukianov building on our nine product launches in  we plan to execute a host of launches in share price  jul  sep nov jan  mar may july sep nov jan  mar may jul sep nov jan  mar share price of nuvasive inc nasdaq nuva from its initial public offering in may  with an opening price of  though early may  with the price above  for the first quarter of  nuvasive reported a net loss of  million on revenues of  million compared with a net loss of  million on revenues of  million in the yearago period the revenue increase represents  growth over firstquarter  levels in january  nuvasive announced that it had acquired technology and assets from radius medical llc including exclusive license and marketing rights to the formagraft bone graft biologic product and the underlying collagen technology our robust firstquarter results were driven by the increased effectiveness of our exclusive sales force on mas products and the early success of spherx ii xlp lateral plate and formagraft lukianov said these innovative products were released on a limited basis during the quarter and were particularly well received by spine surgeons we remain excited about these products and the revenue they will bring starting in the third quarter by which time inventory will be substantially increased the trials the total study involves  patients we are now about  of the way through and we expect to finish the study over the course of the next nine to  months sometime during the first or second quarter of next year and after that how long before the product is likely to be commercially available in the united states we need to complete a twoyear followup on the study patients so we are figuring about  for possible commercial release if everything goes well with the clinical trial and fda process we do have ce marking for our products in europe and we are adding motion preservation devices to that armamentarium so for the international arena we anticipate launching our extreme lateral interbody fusion xlif technique with motion preservation technologies during the fourth quarter of this year so the products will be available in europe in the fourth quarter of this year yes but we will not be conducting a full international launch the key centers we ll be targeting will be mostly the german and englishspeaking countries in europe that will be the primary area but we re also working on our registrations for japan so we intend to launch in the far east a little further in the future what is the overall market opportunity for neodisc in terms of number of procedures or revenue potential neodisc is intended as an alternative to fusion procedures for the neck in the united states approximately  such procedures are performed each year with a market value totaling about  billion as this market changes with the advent of motion preservation devices like neodisc we anticipate that somewhere in the neighborhood of  of the current number of fusion procedures will move toward motion preservation so in other words the market opportunity is somewhere around  million i see neodisc as the kind of product that is so unique that it has a good chance of capturing a significant portion of that opportunity very rapidly following its us launch the other two products that you mentioned the cerpass and the lateral total disk replacement were those also acquisitions no like the vast majority of our products those were developed organically just about everything offered by nuvasive has been developed by our engineering and our marketing teams what percentage of revenues does nuvasive invest in rd right now we are in the high teens as a percentage of revenue i expect for us to stay in that midteen range for the next several years meanwhile nuvasive is also continuing to acquire earlier this year the company acquired the formagraft line of biologic bonevoid fillers from radius medical newport beach ca had you also been watching that product for some time we had been looking for about a year to find a new biologic that we could put into our armamentarium of products we did not have a biologic component so we saw the formagraft line as an ideal product that we could use to add revenue on a perprocedure basis we also made an investment in the manufacturing side of it which is located in taiwan our inventory for the product is just beginning to scale up and we believe there is an opportunity to achieve revenue in the short term perhaps on the order of  million to  million this year but what excites us about the formagraft technology is the potential for future applications of the material ultimately it may be used as a coating for implants or even to deliver things like stem cells there is a lot of upside to this technology and from a business perspective it represented a good deal compared with the premiums that we ve seen paid for a lot of other companies we ve done well with the acquisitions we ve been able to complete including both neodisc and formagraft some of the areas you mentioned take nuvasive away from traditional device areas and into the realms of biologicals and combination products does nuvasive watch those areas closely or invest in them in any way well we ve started really paying attention to those areas and the acquisition of the formagraft line from radius moves us a lot further in that direction in the future we expect to open up some fullfledged research in the area seeing how well medtronic sofamor danek has done in selling its bone morphogenic protein bmp product over the last several years it s apparent that there are opportunities to take things to the next level by combining implants and biologics spreading the word nuvasive has an impressive facility for training clinicians how have the company s activities related to surgeon training affected the clinical adoption of the company s products overall the effects have been terrific in a lot of ways first and foremost the level of expertise that we have at our company is tremendous last year we trained close to  surgeons through our facility so you can just imagine all the engineers and marketing folks that are there in the operating room helping the surgeons of course with this kind of facility every time we launch a new product we can work very closely with surgeons to perfect it pretty much onsite and we think that s a very big competitive edge in general surgeons walk away from their training here feeling enthusiastic and very comfortable about applying the technology consequently our conversion rate has been quite high of the surgeons who have been trained here about  to  apply the technology within the first  to  days so we are very pleased with that the company also has an impressive clinical advisory board of orthopedic and neurological spine surgeons how did you bring that board together what role does the board play in helping you to develop future products and driving the adoption of those products all of our products are developed in concert with surgeons so the involvement of these advisers is critical fortunately our team has been doing this for quite some time and we have very strong track records with many of the country s topranked surgeons those same surgeons have been attracted by the things that we do at nuvasive one of which is to produce products faster than our competitors we see that as an obligation as well as an edge in the marketplace surgeons absolutely love it when they can work with a company that looks to rapidly introduce new products surgeons also love coming here this is the finest spine surgery training facility in all of north america none of the big companies have invested in anything like this so again it differentiates our service and our commitment to new product development cover story year and  topline growth for the first quarter of this year we expect to be able to grow at rates like that for the foreseeable future because it would be prohibitively expensive to start off with the expense of building a large exclusive sales force almost every new company begins life with a nonexclusive sales force just as nuvasive did a nonexclusive sales force has the advantage of putting the company s and i think they are all very pleased to be representing nuvasive on a fulltime basis is the company using the same strategy overseas overseas we are using a combination strategy we are not immediately going to be able to get the kind of volume that would justify creating an exclusive sales force but we will be using some direct sales folks in germany over the next few years we want to become a  million company and with that we want to maintain the culture that we ve been proud to put together here nuvasive started with a core of intellectual property but it is clearly building a significant portfolio around that can you describe what that portfolio looks like now nuvasive s patent portfolio has grown dramatically the company now has  issued us patents and  patents pending those have been developed mostly around our technologies in neurophysiology fusion products and our motion preservation implants we recently also moved into cervical products and for all of these intellectual properties is the vast majority of your development done internally that s correct if we were to put a number on it our organically developed intellectual properties would certainly be in the  range really the only two nuvasive products developed externally are the neodisc and formagraft products that we just acquired exclusive growth nuvasive has invested heavily in developing its own direct sales force why did the company decide to make that move and how is it working out we made this investment because there was no way for nuvasive to achieve robust longterm growth with a nonexclusive sales force we would like to continue growing our top line at the same kinds of rates we ve had in recent quarters as typified by  topline growth last products into the hands of more sales reps but over time that sales force will begin to carry multiple product lines and the company will end up competing for the attention of both the sales reps and their customers in short a nonexclusive sales force just can t give an emerging company the sort of attention that it needs to significantly ramp sales so clearly building our own exclusive sales force which is about  direct and  exclusive distributors has completely transformed our company i felt very strongly about this strategy when we began down this path a few years ago and we had absolutely no difficulty convincing people of the need to spend dollars on it and we did we have been very aggressive and it has cost us millions of dollars but i think the benefits of the strategy are already coming to pass we completed our transition to an exclusive sales force in june  and we ve seen nothing but record quarters ever since today we have about  people in that sales force has nuvasive grown to the point that it is now an acquisition target would that be a desirable outcome for the company we are not looking to sell the company and we certainly don t want to be an acquisition target over the next few years we want to become a  million company and with that we want to maintain the culture that we ve been proud to put together here we want to offer the kind of products that we feel are critical to longterm success and we have spent considerable time developing a strategy to achieve these goals we have enjoyed being consistently ranked very highly by the financial community from number three to number five among the top innovators in the spine field but what s really driving the nuvasive team is that everybody is enjoying the way the company is growing so nuvasive s success is not measured only by hitting financial targets it s also seen in how the company has grown its strong culture of high performance its commitment to serving customers and a lot of other factors that you ve heard a million times from many different companies but i will tell you that people here really live it nuvasive is a different kind of place from what most people are accustomed to we are proud of that and we want to perpetuate it reprinted from mx mayjune  copyright  canon communications llc similar documents nuvasive developing creative solutions
