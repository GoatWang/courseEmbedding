securities represent a share of an issuers earnings and assets after the issuer pays its liabilities the equity funds cannot predict the income they will receive from equity securities because issuers generally have discretion as to the payment of any dividends or distributions however equity securities offer greater potential for appreciation than many other types of securities because their value increases directly with the value of the issuers business common stocks common stocks are the most prevalent type of equity security common stocks receive the issuers earnings after the issuer pays its creditors and any preferred stockholders as a result changes in an issuers earnings directly influence the value of its common stock fixed income securities fixed income securities pay interest dividends or distributions at a specified rate the rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted periodically in addition the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the principal amount of the security normally within a specified time fixed income securities provide more regular income than equity securities however the returns on fixed income securities are limited and normally do not increase with the issuers earnings this limits the potential appreciation of fixed income securities as compared to equity securities a securitys yield measures the annual income earned on a security as a percentage of its price a securitys yield will increase or decrease depending upon whether it costs less a discount or more a premium than the principal amount if the issuer may redeem the security before its scheduled maturity the price and yield on a discount or premium security may change based upon the probability of an early redemption securities with higher risks generally have higher yields tax exempt securities tax exempt securities are fixed income securities that pay interest that is not subject to regular federal income taxes typically states counties cities and other political subdivisions and authorities issue tax exempt securities the market categorizes tax exempt securities by their source of repayment municipal notes municipal notes are shortterm tax exempt securities many municipalities issue such notes to fund their current operations before collecting taxes or other municipal revenues municipalities may also issue notes to fund capital projects prior to issuing longterm bonds the issuers typically repay the notes at the end of their fiscal year either with taxes other revenues or proceeds from newly issued notes or bonds paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th foreign securities foreign securities are securities of issuers based outside the united states the funds consider an issuer to be based outside the united states if oit is organized under the laws of or has a principal office located in another country othe principal trading market for its securities is in another country or oit or its subsidiaries derived in its most current fiscal year at least  of its total assets capitalization gross revenue or profit from goods produced services performed or sales made in another country foreign securities are primarily denominated in foreign currencies along with the risks normally associated with domestic securities of the same type foreign securities are subject currency risks and risks of foreign investing specific risks of investing in the old westbury funds equity securities risks the equity funds are subject to fluctuations in the stock markets which have periods of increasing and decreasing values stocks have greater volatility than debt securities while greater volatility increases risks it offers the potential for greater reward equity risk is also related to the size of the company issuing stock companies may be categorized as having a small medium or large capitalization market value the potential risks are higher with small and mediumcapitalization companies and lower with largecapitalization companies therefore you should expect that investments in the growth opportunity fund will be more volatile than broad stock market indices such as the sp  or funds that invest in largecapitalization companies such as the core equities fund foreign securities risks foreign securities pose additional risks over usbased securities for a number of reasons because the international fund invests primarily in foreign securities and the growth opportunity fund can invest in canadian securities you should expect that these factors may adversely affect the value of an investment in these funds foreign economic governmental and political systems may be less favorable than those of the us foreign governments may exercise greater control over their economies industries and citizens rights specific risk factors related to foreign securities include inflation structure and regulation of financial markets liquidity and volatility of investments taxation policies currency exchange rates and regulations and accounting standards the international fund and growth opportunity fund may incur higher costs and expenses when making foreign investments which will affect the funds total return foreign securities may be denominated in foreign currencies therefore the value of a funds assets and income in us dollars may be affected by changes in exchange rates and regulations since exchange rates for foreign currencies change daily the combination of currency risk and market risk tends to make securities traded in foreign markets more volatile than securities traded exclusively in the us although the international fund and growth opportunity fund value their assets daily in us dollars they will not convert its holding of foreign currencies to us dollars daily therefore the funds may be exposed to currency risks over an extended period of time emerging market securities risks international fund may invest up to  of its assets in developing or emerging market securities investments in developing or emerging market securities are subject to higher risks than those in developed market countries because there is greater uncertainty in less established markets and economies these risks include political social or economic systems smaller securities markets lower trading volume and substantial rates of inflation fixed income securities risks risks of fixed income securities will affect the income funds prices of fixedrate debt securities generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates the interest payments on fixedrate debt securities do not change when interest rates change therefore since the price of these securities can be expected to decrease when interest rates increase you can expect that the value of investments in a fund may go down although the adviser attempts to anticipate interest rate movements there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so in addition longerterm debt securities will experience greater price volatility than debt securities with shorter maturities you can expect the net asset values of a fund to fluctuate accordingly the credit quality of a debt security is based upon the issuers ability to repay the security if payments on a debt security are not paid when due that may cause the net asset value of a fund holding the security to go down fixed income securities may also be subject to call risk if interest rates decline an issuer may repay or call a debt security held by a fund prior to its maturity if this occurs the adviser may have to reinvest the proceeds in debt securities paying lower interest rates if this happens a fund may have a lower yield in addition fixed income fund may invest in inverse floaters which are a form of derivative debt security and whose price may be subject to extreme fluctuation in the event of interest rate movements municipal securities risks an investment in the municipal bond fund will be affected by municipal securities risks local political and economic factors may adversely affect the value and liquidity of municipal securities held by a fund the value of municipal securities also may be affected more by supply and demand factors or the creditworthiness of the issuer than by market interest rates repayment of municipal securities depends on the ability of the issuer or project backing such securities to generate taxes or revenues there is a risk that the interest on an otherwise taxexempt municipal security may be subject to federal income tax assetbackedmortgagebacked securities risks an investment in the fixed income fund will be subject to assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities risks which includes prepayment when interest rates fall because many borrowers refinance mortgages to take advantage of more favorable rates prepayments on mortgagebacked securities are also affected by other factors such as the volume of home sales a funds yield will be reduced if cash from prepaid securities is reinvested in securities with lower interest rates the risk of prepayment may also decrease the value of mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities may have a higher level of default and recovery risk than mortgagebacked securities however both of these types of securities may decline in value because of mortgage foreclosures or defaults on the underlying obligations futures and options risks growth opportunity fund core equities fund and fixed income fund may use financial and stock index futures and options primarily to protect against adverse changes to the value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest rates or market conditions similarly international fund may use foreign currency futures and options to protect against adverse changes to the value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in foreign currency rates the successful use of futures options and other derivative instruments is based on the advisers ability to correctly anticipate market movements when the direction of the prices of a funds securities does not correlate with the changes in the value of these transactions or when the trading market for derivatives becomes illiquid a fund could lose money risks related to company size generally the smaller the market capitalization of a company the fewer the number of hsares traded daily the less liquied its stock and the more volatile its price market capitalization is determined by multiplying the number of its outstanding shares by the current market price per share companies with smaller market capitalizations also tend to have unproven track records a limited product or service base and limited access to capital these factors also increase risks and make these companies more likely to fail than larger well capitalized companies securities lending risks when a fund lends its portfolio securities it may not be able to get them back from the borrower on a timely basis if this occurs the fund may lose certain investment opportunities the funds are also subject to the risks associated with the investment of cash collateral usually fixedincome securities risk temporary defensive investments to minimize potential losses and maintain liquidity necessary to meet shareholder redemptions during adverse market conditions each of the old westbury funds may temporarily depart from its principal investment strategy by investing up to  of fund assets in cash or shortterm high quality money market instruments eg commercial paper repurchase agreements etc this may cause a fund to temporarily forgo greater investment returns for the safety of principal investment ratings some securities in which the funds invest will be rated in the lowest investment grade category eg bbb or baa securities rated bbb by standard and poors or baa by moodys investors services inc have speculative characteristics unrated securities will be determined by the adviser to be of like quality and may have greater risk but a potentially higher yield than comparable rated securities if a security is downgraded the adviser will reevaluate the security and determine whether or not the security is an acceptable investment portfolio turnover the funds do not intend to invest for the purpose of seeking shortterm profits securities will be sold without regard to the length of time they have been held when the funds adviser believes it is appropriate to do so in light of a funds investment goal a higher portfolio turnover rate involves greater transaction expenses which must be borne directly by a fund and thus indirectly by its shareholders and affect fund performance in addition a high rate of portfolio turnover may result in the realization of larger amounts of capital gains which when distributed to that funds shareholders are taxable to them year  readiness the year  problem is the potential for computer errors or failures because certain computer systems may be unable to interpret dates after december   the year  problem may cause systems to process information incorrectly and could disrupt businesses that rely on computers like the funds while it is impossible to determine in advance all of the risks to the funds the funds could experience interruptions in basic financial and operational functions fund shareholders could experience errors or disruptions in fund share transactions or fund communications the funds service providers are making changes to their computer systems to attempt to fix any year  problems in addition they are working to gather information from thirdparty providers to determine their year  readiness year  problems would also increase the risks of the funds investments to assess the potential effect of the year  problem the investment adviser is reviewing information regarding the year  readiness of issuers of securities the fund may purchase however this may be difficult with certain issuers for example funds dealing with foreign service providers or investing in foreign securities will have difficulty determining the year  readiness of those entities this is especially true of entities or issuers in emerging markets the financial impact of these issues for the funds is still being determined there can be no assurance that potential year  problems would not have a material adverse effect on the

descriptions techniques and risks used by the funds in addition to those described in the prospectus asset backed securities assetbacked securities are issued by nongovernmental entities and carry no direct or indirect government guarantee assetbacked securities represent an interest in a pool of assets such as car loans and credit card receivables these securities may be in the form of passthrough instruments or assetbacked bonds payments on assetbacked securities depend upon assets held by the issuer and collections of the underlying loans the value of these securities depends on many factors including changing interest rates the availability of information about the pool and its structure the credit quality of the underlying assets the markets perception of the servicer of the pool and any credit enhancement provided also these securities may be subject to prepayment risk bank obligations bank obligations include negotiable certificates of deposit time deposits and bankers acceptances the funds will invest in bank instruments i that have been issued by banks and savings and loans and savings banks that have more than  billion in total assets and are organized under the laws of the united states or any state ii of foreign branches of these banks or of foreign banks of equivalent size and iii of us branches of foreign banks of equivalent size the funds will not invest in obligations for which the adviser or any of its affiliated persons is the ultimate obligor or accepting bank the funds may also invest in obligations of the european investment bank the interamerican development bank or the world bank and other such similar institutions borrowing the funds may borrow money from banks or through reverse repurchase agreements in amounts up to onethird of total assets and pledge some assets as collateral a fund that borrows will pay interest on borrowed money and may incur other transaction costs these expenses could exceed the income received or capital appreciation realized by the fund from any securities purchased with borrowed money with respect to borrowings the funds are required to maintain continuous asset coverage to  of the amount borrowed if the coverage declines to less than  the fund must sell sufficient portfolio securities to restore the coverage even if it must sell the securities at a loss commercial paper the funds may invest in commercial paper including master demand obligations master demand obligations are obligations that provide for a periodic adjustment in the interest rate paid and permit daily changes in the amount borrowed the commercial paper in which the funds may invest must be rated a or a by standard  poors sp prime or prime by moodys investors service inc moodys or f or f by fitch ibca inc fitch master demand obligations are governed by agreements between the issuer and bessemer trust company na acting as agent for no additional fee in its capacity as investment adviser to the funds and as fiduciary for other clients for whom it exercises investment discretion the monies loaned to the borrower come from accounts managed by the adviser or its affiliates pursuant to arrangements with such accounts interest and principal payments are credited to such accounts the adviser acting as a fiduciary on behalf of its clients has the right to increase or decrease the amount provided to the borrower under an obligation the borrower has the right to pay without penalty all or any part of the principal amount then outstanding on an obligation together with interest to the date of payment since these obligations typically provide that the interest rate is tied to the federal reserve commercial paper composite rate the rate on master demand obligations is subject to change repayment of a master demand obligation to participating accounts depends on the ability of the borrower to pay the accrued interest and principal of the obligation on demand which is continuously monitored by the adviser since master demand obligations typically are not rated by credit rating agencies the funds may invest in such unrated obligations only if at the time of an investment the obligation is determined by the adviser to have a credit quality which satisfies the funds quality restrictions although there is no secondary market for master demand obligations such obligations are considered by the funds to be liquid because they are payable upon demand the funds do not have any specific percentage limitation on investments in master demand obligations common stocks are the most prevalent type of equity security common stockholders receive the residual value of the issuers earnings and assets after the issuer pays its creditors and any preferred stockholders as a result changes in an issuers earnings directly influence the value of its common stock convertible securities certain funds may as an interim alternative to investment in common stocks purchase investment grade convertible debt securities having a rating of or equivalent to at least bbb by sp or baa by moodys or if unrated judged by the adviser to be of comparable quality securities rated bbb or baa have speculative characteristics although lower rated bonds generally have higher yields they are more speculative and subject to a greater risk of default with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal than are higher rated debt securities in selecting convertible securities the adviser relies primarily on its own evaluation of the issuer and the potential for capital appreciation through conversion it does not rely on the rating of the security or sell because of a change in the rating absent a change in its own evaluation of the underling common stock and the ability of the issuer to pay principal and interest or dividends when due without disrupting its business goals interest or dividend yield is a factor only to the extent it is reasonably consistent with prevailing rates for securities of similar quality and thereby provides a support level for the market price of the security the funds will purchase the convertible securities of highly leveraged issuers only when in the judgment of the adviser the risk of default is outweighed by the potential for capital appreciation the funds do not intend to purchase convertible securities in excess of  of the funds total assets corporate reorganizations each fund may invest in securities for which a tender or exchange offer has been made or announced and in securities of companies for which a merger consolidation liquidation or reorganization proposal has been announced if in the judgment of the adviser there is reasonable prospect of capital appreciation significantly greater than the brokerage and other transaction expenses involved the primary risk of such investments is that if the contemplated transaction is abandoned revised delayed or becomes subject to unanticipated uncertainties the market price of the securities may decline below the purchase price paid by the funds in general securities which are the subject of such an offer or proposal sell at a premium to their historic market price immediately prior to the announcement of the offer or proposal however the increased market price of such securities may also discount what the stated or appraised value of the security would be if the contemplated transaction were approved or consummated such investments may be advantageous when the discount significantly overstates the risk of the contingencies involved significantly undervalues the securities assets or cash to be received by shareholders of the prospective portfolio company as a result of the contemplated transaction or fails adequately to recognize the possibility that the offer or proposal may be replaced or superseded by an offer or proposal of greater value the evaluation of such contingencies requires unusually broad knowledge and experience on the part of the adviser which must appraise not only the value of the issuer and its component businesses as well as the assets or securities to be received as a result of the contemplated transaction but also the financial resources and business motivation of the offerer as well as the dynamics of the business climate when the offer or proposal is in process in making such investments each fund will not violate any of its diversification requirements or investment restrictions see below investment restrictions including the requirement that with respect to  of its total assets not more than  of its total assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer since such investments are ordinarily short term in nature they will increase the turnover ratio of the funds thereby increasing its brokerage and other transaction expenses the adviser intends to select investments of the type described which in its view have a reasonable prospect of capital appreciation which is significant in relation to both the risk involved and the potential of available alternate investments as well as monitor the effect of such investments on the tax qualification tests of the code each fund does not intend to purchase these securities in excess of  of that funds total assets credit quality the fixed income securities in which a fund invests will be rated at least investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization nrsro investment grade securities have received one of an nrsros four highest ratings securities receiving the fourth highest rating baa by moodys or bbb by sp or fitch have speculative characteristics and changes in the market or the economy are more likely to affect the ability of the issuer to repay its obligations when due the adviser will evaluate downgraded securities and will sell any security determined not to be an acceptable investment international fund core equities fund growth opportunity fund and the fixed income fund may invest up to  of their net assets in securities rated below investment grade but not below the sixth highest rating category the growth opportunity fund core equities fund and municipal bond fund will not invest in securities rated below investment grade see high yield securities debt obligations the funds may invest in debt obligations including bonds notes and debentures of corporate issuers or governments which may have fixed or floating rates of interest fixed rate debt obligations the funds may invest in fixed rate debt obligations including fixed rate debt securities with shortterm characteristics fixed rate securities with shortterm characteristics are longterm debt obligations but are treated in the market as having short maturities because call features of the securities may make them callable within a short period of time a fixed rate security with shortterm characteristics would include a fixed income security priced close to call or redemption price or a fixed income security approaching maturity where the expectation of call or redemption is high fixed rate securities exhibit more price volatility during times of rising or falling interest rates than securities with floating rates of interest this is because floating rate securities as described below behave like shortterm instruments in that the rate of interest they pay is subject to periodic adjustments based on a designated interest rate index fixed rate securities pay a fixed rate of interest and are more sensitive to fluctuating interest rates in periods of rising interest rates the value of a fixed rate security is likely to fall fixed rate securities with shortterm characteristics are not subject to the same price volatility as fixed rate securities without such characteristics therefore they behave more like floating rate securities with respect to price volatility floating rate debt obligations the funds may invest in floating rate debt obligations including increasing rate securities floating rate securities are generally offered at an initial interest rate which is at or above prevailing market rates the interest rate paid on these securities is then reset periodically commonly every  days to an increment over some predetermined interest rate index commonly utilized indices include the threemonth treasury bill rate the day treasury bill rate the onemonth or threemonth london interbank offered rate libor the prime rate of a bank the commercial paper rates or the longerterm rates on us treasury securities increasing rate securities rates are reset periodically at different levels on a predetermined scale these levels of interest are ordinarily set at progressively higher increments over time some increasing rate securities may by agreement revert to a fixed rate status these securities may also contain features which allow the issuer the option to convert the increasing rate of interest to a fixed rate under such terms conditions and limitations as are described in each issuers prospectus derivative contracts and securities the term derivative has traditionally been applied to certain contracts futures forward option and swap contracts that derive their value from changes in the value of an underlying security currency commodity or index derivatives also refer to securities that incorporate the performance characteristics of these contracts and securities derived from the cash flows from underlying securities mortgages or other obligations while the response of certain derivatives to market changes may differ from traditional investments like stocks and bonds they do not necessarily present greater market risks than traditional investments derivative contracts and securities can be used to reduce or increase the volatility of an investment portfolios total performance depositary receipts american depositary receipts adrs are receipts issued by a us bank that represent an interest in shares of a foreignbased corporation adrs provide a way to buy shares of foreignbased companies in the us rather than in overseas markets european depositary receipts edrs and global depositary receipts gdrs are receipts issued by foreign banks or trust companies or foreign branches of us banks that represent an interest in shares of either a foreign or us corporation depositary receipts may not be denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities into which they may be converted and are subject to currency risks depositary receipts involve many of the same risks of investing directly in foreign securities emerging growth companies emerging growth companies are companies that are beyond their initial startup periods but have not yet reached a state of established growth or maturity the nature of investing in emerging growth companies involves a greater level of risk than would be associated when investing in more established seasoned companies the rate of growth of such companies may at times be dramatic such companies often provide new products or services that enable them to capture a dominant or important market position or have a special area of expertise or are able to take advantage of changes in demographic factors in a more profitable way than other companies these companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may lack management depth since they have not been tested by time or the marketplace the securities of emerging growth companies often have limited marketability and may be subject to more volatile market movements than securities of larger more established growth companies or the market averages in general shares of the growth opportunity fund therefore may be subject to greater fluctuation in value than funds investing entirely in proven growth stocks foreign currency transactions foreign currency transactions are generally used to obtain foreign currencies to settle securities transactions they can also be used as a hedge to protect assets against adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or regulations when the fund uses foreign currency exchanges as a hedge it may also limit potential gain that could result from an increase in the value of such currencies the fund may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by fluctuations in the relative rates of exchange between the currencies of different nations foreign currency hedging transactions foreign currency hedging transactions are used to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks these transactions include forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency futures contracts and purchasing put or call options on foreign currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts forward contracts are used to minimize the risks associated with changes in the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies they are used to lock in the us dollar price of a foreign security a forward contract is a commitment to purchase or sell a specific currency for an agreed price at a future date if the adviser believes a foreign currency will decline against the us dollar a forward contract may be used to sell an amount of the foreign currency approximating the value of a funds security that is denominated in the foreign currency the success of this hedging strategy is highly uncertain due to the difficulties of predicting the values of foreign currencies of precisely matching forward contract amounts and because of the constantly changing value of the securities involved the fund will not enter into forward contracts for hedging purposes in a particular currency in an amount in excess of the funds assets denominated in that currency conversely if the adviser believes that the us dollar will decline against a foreign currency a forward contract may be used to buy that foreign currency for a fixed dollar amount otherwise known as crosshedging in these transactions the fund will segregate assets with a market value equal to the amount of the foreign currency purchased therefore the fund will always have cash cash equivalents or high quality debt securities available to cover forward contracts or to limit any potential risk the segregated assets will be priced daily forward contracts may limit potential gain from a positive change in the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies unanticipated changes in currency prices may result in poorer overall performance for a fund than if it had not engaged in such contracts purchasing and writing put and call options on foreign currencies are used to protect the funds portfolio against declines in the us dollar value of foreign portfolio securities and against increases in the dollar cost of foreign securities to be acquired writing an option on foreign currency constitutes only a partial hedge up to the amount of the premium received the fund could lose money if it is required to purchase or sell foreign currencies at disadvantageous exchange rates if exchange rate movements are adverse to the funds position the fund may forfeit the entire amount of the premium plus related transaction costs these options are traded on us and foreign exchanges or overthecounter the fund may write sell covered call options and secured put options on up to  of net assets and may purchase put and call options provided that no more than  of net assets may be invested in premiums on such options foreign securities the funds other than the municipal bond fund may invest in certain foreign securities however the only foreign securities the growth opportunity fund may invest in are securities of canadian based companies investment in securities of foreign issuers and in obligations of foreign branches of domestic banks involves somewhat different investment risks from those affecting securities of us domestic issuers there may be limited publicly available information with respect to foreign issuers and foreign issuers are not generally subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial standards and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic companies dividends and interest paid by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes which may decrease the net return on foreign investments as compared to dividends and interest paid to the funds by domestic companies investors should realize that the value of the funds investments in foreign securities may be adversely affected by changes in political or social conditions diplomatic relations confiscatory taxation expropriation nationalization limitation on the removal of funds or assets or imposition of or change in exchange control or tax regulations in those foreign countries in addition changes in government administrations or economic or monetary policies in the united states or abroad could result in appreciation or depreciation of portfolio securities and could favorably or unfavorably affect the funds operations furthermore the economies of individual foreign nations may differ from the us economy whether favorably or unfavorably in areas such as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position it may also be more difficult to obtain and enforce a judgment against a foreign issuer any foreign investments made by the funds must be made in compliance with us foreign currency restrictions and tax laws restricting the amounts and types of foreign investments investments are made primarily in those regions where in the opinion of the funds adviser there are opportunities to achieve superior investment returns relative to other investment opportunities outside the united states the international fund does not however generally invest in debt or equity securities of us issuers the international fund emphasizes those industrial sectors of the worlds market which in the opinion of its adviser offer the most attractive riskreward relationships securities of any given issuer are evaluated on the basis of such measures as priceearnings ratios pricebook ratios cash flows and dividend and interest income since investments in foreign securities may involve foreign currencies the value of a funds assets as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency rates and exchange control regulations including currency blockage in addition while the volume of transactions effected on foreign stock exchanges has increased in recent years in most cases it remains appreciably below that of domestic security exchanges accordingly the funds foreign investments may be less liquid and their prices may be more volatile than comparable investments in securities of us companies moreover the settlement periods for foreign securities which are often longer than those for securities of us issuers may affect portfolio liquidity in buying and selling securities on foreign exchanges purchasers normally pay fixed commissions that are generally higher than the negotiated commissions charged in the united states in addition there is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and issuers located in foreign countries than in the united states canadian companies the growth opportunity fund may invest more than  of its total assets in canadian securities canadian securities are sensitive to conditions within canada but also tend to follow the us market the countrys economy relies strongly on the production and processing of natural resources also the government has attempted to reduce restrictions against foreign investment and its trade agreements with the us and mexico are expected to increase trade also demand by many citizens in the province of quebec for secession from canada may significantly impact the canadian economy in addition the value in us dollars of the funds assets denominated in canadian currency may be affected b changes in exchange rates and regulations futures and options transactions as a means of reducing fluctuations in its net asset value a fund may buy and sell futures contracts and options on futures contracts and buy put and call options on portfolio securities and securities indices to hedge its portfolio a fund may also write covered put and call options on portfolio securities to attempt to increase its current income or to hedge its portfolio there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular futures contract or option at any particular time the funds ability to establish and close out futures and options positions depends on this secondary market futures contracts a futures contract is a commitment by two parties under which one party agrees to make delivery of an asset seller and another party agrees to take delivery of the asset at a certain time in the future a futures contract may involve a variety of assets including commodities such as oil wheat or corn or a financial asset such as a security a fund may purchase and sell financial futures contracts to hedge against anticipated changes in the value of its portfolio without necessarily buying or selling the securities although some financial futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying securities in most cases these obligations are closed out before the settlement date the closing of a futures contract is accomplished by purchasing or selling an identical offsetting futures contract other financial futures contracts call for cash settlements a fund may purchase and sell stock index futures contracts to hedge against anticipated price changes with respect to any stock index traded on a recognized stock exchange or board of trade a stock index futures contract is an agreement in which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the price of the original contract and the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract no physical delivery of the underlying securities in the index is made settlement is made in cash upon termination of the contract margin in futures transactions since a fund does not pay or receive money upon the purchase or sale of a futures contract it is required to deposit an amount of initial margin in cash us government securities or highlyliquid debt securities as a good faith deposit the margin is returned to the fund upon termination of the contract initial margin in futures transactions does not involve borrowing to finance the transactions as the value of the underlying futures contract changes daily the fund pays or receives cash called variation margin equal to the daily change in value of the futures contract this process is known as marking to market variation margin does not represent a borrowing or loan by the fund it may be viewed as settlement between the fund and the broker of the amount one would owe the other if the futures contract expired when the fund purchases futures contracts an amount of cash andor cash equivalents equal to the underlying commodity value of the futures contracts less any related margin deposits will be deposited in a segregated account with the funds custodian to collateralize the position and insure that the use of futures contracts is unleveraged the fund is also required to deposit and maintain margin when it writes call options on futures contracts a fund will not enter into a futures contract or purchase an option thereon for other than hedging purposes if immediately thereafter the initial margin deposits for futures contracts held by it plus premiums paid by it for open options on futures contracts would exceed  of the market value of its net assets after taking into account the unrealized profits and losses on those contracts it has entered into however in the case of an option that is inthemoney at the time of purchase the inthemoney amount may be excluded in computing such  paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th put options on financial and stock index futures contracts a fund may purchase listed put options on financial and stock index futures contracts to protect portfolio securities against decreases in value unlike entering directly into a futures contract which requires the purchaser to buy a financial instrument on a set date at a specified price the purchase of a put option on a futures contract entitles but does not obligate its purchaser to decide on or before a future date whether to assume a short position at the specified price generally if the hedged portfolio securities decrease in value during the term of an option the related futures contracts will also decrease in value and the option will increase in value in such an event the fund will normally close out its option by selling an identical option if the hedge is successful the proceeds received by the fund upon the sale of the second option will be large enough to offset both the premium paid by the fund for the original option plus the decrease in value of the hedged securities alternatively a fund may exercise its put option to close out the position to do so it would simultaneously enter into a futures contract of the type underlying the option for a price less than the strike price of the option and exercise the option the fund would then deliver the futures contract in return for payment of the strike price if the fund neither closes out nor exercises an option the option will expire on the date provided in the option contract and only the premium paid for the contract will be lost a fund may also write sell listed put options on financial or stock index futures contracts to hedge its portfolio against a decrease in market interest rates or an increase in stock prices a fund will use these transactions to purchase portfolio securities in the future at price levels existing at the time it enters into the transaction when a fund sells a put on a futures contract it receives a cash premium in exchange for granting to the buyer of the put the right to receive from the fund at the strike price a short position in such futures contract this is so even though the strike price upon exercise of the option is greater than the value of the futures position received by such holder as market interest rates decrease or stock prices increase the market price of the underlying futures contract normally increases when the underlying futures contract increases the buyer of the put option has less reason to exercise the put because the buyer can sell the same futures contract at a higher price in the market if the value of the underlying futures position is not such that exercise of the option would be profitable to the option holder the option will generally expire without being exercised the premium received by the fund can then be used to offset the higher prices of portfolio securities to be purchased in the future in order to avoid the exercise of an option sold by it generally a fund will cancel its obligation under the option by entering into a closing purchase transaction unless it is determined to be in the funds interest to deliver the underlying futures position a closing purchase transaction consists of the purchase by the fund of an option having the same term as the option sold by the fund and has the effect of canceling the funds position as a seller the premium which the fund will pay in executing a closing purchase transaction may be higher than the premium received when the option was sold depending in large part upon the relative price of the underlying futures position at the time of each transaction if the hedge is successful the cost of buying the second option will be less than the premium received by the fund for the initial option call options on financial and stock index futures contracts a fund may write sell listed and overthecounter call options on financial and stock index futures contracts to hedge its portfolio when the fund writes a call option on a futures contract it undertakes to sell a futures contract at the fixed price at any time during the life of the option as stock prices fall or market interest rates rise causing the prices of futures to go down the funds obligation to sell a futures contract costs less to fulfill causing the value of the funds call option position to increase in other words as the underlying futures price goes down below the strike price the buyer of the option has no reason to exercise the call so that the fund keeps the premium received for the option this premium can substantially offset the drop in value of the funds portfolio securities prior to the expiration of a call written by a fund or exercise of it by the buyer the fund may close out the option by buying an identical option if the hedge is successful the cost of the second option will be less than the premium received by the fund for the initial option the net premium income of the fund will then substantially offset the decrease in value of the hedged securities a fund may buy a listed call option on a financial or stock index futures contract to hedge against decreases in market interest rates or increases in stock price a fund will use these transactions to purchase portfolio securities in the future at price levels existing at the time it enters into the transaction when a fund purchases a call on a financial futures contract it receives in exchange for the payment of a cash premium the right but not the obligation to enter into the underlying futures contract at a strike price determined at the time the call was purchased regardless of the comparative market value of such futures position at the time the option is exercised the holder of a call option has the right to receive a long or buyers position in the underlying futures contract as market interest rates fall or stock prices increase the value of the underlying futures contract will normally increase resulting in an increase in value of the funds option position when the market price of the underlying futures contract increases above the strike price plus premium paid the fund could exercise its option and buy the futures contract below market price prior to the exercise or expiration of the call option the fund could sell an identical call option and close out its position if the premium received upon selling the offsetting call is greater than the premium originally paid the fund has completed a successful hedge limitation on open futures positions a fund will not maintain open positions in futures contracts it has sold or call options it has written on futures contracts if together the value of the open positions exceeds the current market value of the funds portfolio plus or minus the unrealized gain or loss on those open positions adjusted for the correlation of volatility between the hedged securities and the futures contracts if this limitation is exceeded at any time the fund will take prompt action to close out a sufficient number of open contracts to bring its open futures and options positions within this limitation purchasing put and call options on securities a fund may purchase put options on portfolio securities to protect against price movements in the funds portfolio a put option gives the fund in return for a premium the right to sell the underlying security to the writer seller at a specified price during the term of the option a fund may purchase call options on securities acceptable for purchase to protect against price movements by locking in on a purchase price for the underlying security a call option gives the fund in return for a premium the right to buy the underlying security from the seller at a specified price during the term of the option writing covered call and put options on securities a fund may write covered call and put options to generate income and thereby protect against price movements in the funds portfolio securities as writer of a call option the fund has the obligation upon exercise of the option during the option period to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the exercise price the fund may only sell call options either on securities held in its portfolio or on securities which it has the right to obtain without payment of further consideration or has segregated cash or us government securities in the amount of any additional consideration as a writer of a put option the fund has the obligation to purchase a security from the purchaser of the option upon the exercise of the option in the case of put options the fund will segregate cash or us treasury obligations with a value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the underlying securities stock index options a fund may purchase or sell put or call options on stock indices listed on national securities exchanges or traded in the overthecounter market a stock index fluctuates with changes in the market values of the stocks included in the index upon the exercise of the option the holder of a call option has the right to receive and the writer of a put option has the obligation to deliver a cash payment equal to the difference between the closing price of the index and the exercise price of the option the effectiveness of purchasing stock index options will depend upon the extent to which price movements in the funds portfolio correlate with price movements of the stock index selected the value of an index option depends upon movements in the level of the index rather than the price of a particular stock accordingly successful use by a fund of options on stock indices will be subject to the adviser correctly predicting movements in the directions of the stock market generally or of a particular industry this requires different skills and techniques than predicting changes in the price of individual stocks overthecounter options overthecounter options are twoparty contracts with price and terms negotiated between buyer and seller in contrast exchangetraded options are thirdparty contracts with standardized strike prices and expiration dates and are purchased from a clearing corporation exchangetraded options have a continuous liquid market while overthecounter options may not a fund may generally purchase and write overthecounter options on portfolio securities or securities indices in negotiated transactions with the buyers or writers of the options when options on the funds portfolio securities or securities indices are not traded on an exchange the fund purchases and writes options only with investment dealers and other financial institutions deemed creditworthy by adviser risks when a fund uses futures and options on futures as hedging devices there is a risk that the prices of the securities or foreign currency subject to the futures contracts may not correlate perfectly with the prices of the securities or currency in the funds portfolio this may cause the futures contract and any related options to react differently to market changes than the portfolio securities or foreign currency in addition the adviser could be incorrect in its expectations about the direction or extent of market factors such as stock price movements or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in these events the fund may lose money on the futures contract or option when a fund purchases futures contracts an amount of cash and cash equivalents equal to the underlying commodity value of the futures contracts less any related margin deposits will be deposited in a segregated account with the funds custodian or the broker to collateralize the position and thereby insure that the use of such futures contract is unleveraged when the fund sells futures contracts it will either own or have the right to receive the underlying future or security or will make deposits to collateralize the position as discussed above high yield securities the issuers of debt obligations having speculative characteristics may experience difficulty in paying principal and interest when due in the event of a downturn in the economy or unanticipated corporate developments the market prices of such securities may become increasingly volatile in periods of economic uncertainty moreover adverse publicity or the perceptions of investors over which the adviser has no control whether or not based on fundamental analysis may decrease the market price and liquidity of such investments although the adviser will attempt to avoid exposing each fund to such risks there is no assurance that it will be successful or that a liquid secondary market will continue to be available for the disposition of such securities international fund core equities fund and fixed income fund may purchase or hold not more than  of its net assets in securities rated below investment grade but not lower than the sixth highest rating growth opportunity fund may purchase or hold not more than  or its assets in convertible debt securities regardless of their ratings municipal bond fund will not invest in securities rated below investment grade the market for unrated securities may not be as liquid as the market for rated securities which may result in depressed prices for the funds in the disposal of such nonrated securities there is no established secondary market for many of these securities the adviser cannot anticipate whether these securities could be sold other than to institutional investors there is frequently no secondary market for the resale of those debt obligations that are in default the limited market for these securities may affect the amount actually realized by each fund upon such sale such sale may result in a loss to each fund there are certain risks involved in applying credit ratings as a method of evaluating high yield securities for example while credit rating agencies evaluate the safety of principal and interest payments they do not evaluate the market risk of the securities and the securities may decrease in value as a result of credit developments lower rated and nonrated securities tend to offer higher yields than higher rated securities with the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the obligors of lower rated securities may not have been as strong as that of other issuers since there is a general perception that there are greater risks associated with the lowerrated securities in each fund the yields and prices of such securities tend to fluctuate more with changes in the perceived quality of the credit of their obligors in addition the market value of high yield securities may fluctuate more than the market value of higher rated securities since high yield securities tend to reflect shortterm market developments to a greater extent than higher rated securities which fluctuate primarily in response to the general level of interest rates assuming that there has been no change in the fundamental credit quality of such securities high yield securities are also more sensitive to adverse economic changes and events affecting specific issuers than are higher rated securities periods of economic uncertainty can be expected to result in increased market price volatility of the high yield securities high yield securities may also be directly and adversely affected by variables such as interest rates unemployment rates inflation rates and real growth in the economy and may be more susceptible to variables such as adverse publicity and negative investor perception than are more highly rated securities particularly in a limited secondary market lower rated securities generally involve greater risks of loss of income and principal than higher rated securities the obligors of lower rated securities possess less creditworthy characteristics than the obligors of higher rated securities as is evidenced by those securities that have experienced a downgrading in rating or that are in default the evaluation of the price of such securities is highly speculative and volatile as such these evaluations are very sensitive to the latest available public information relating to developments concerning such securities illiquid and restricted securities the funds may purchase securities which are subject to legal or contractual delays restrictions and costs on resale because of time limitations the funds might not be able to dispose of these securities at reasonable prices or at times advantageous to the fund the fund intends to limit the purchase of restricted securities which have not been determined by the adviser to be liquid together with other securities considered to be illiquid including repurchase agreements providing for settlement in more than seven days after notice to not more than  of its assets inverse floaters certain securities issued by agencies of the us government agency securities that include a class bearing a floating rate of interest also may include a class whose yield floats inversely against a specified index rate these inverse floaters are more volatile than conventional fixed income or floating rate classes of an agency security and the yield thereon as well as the value thereof will fluctuate in inverse proportion to changes in the index on which interest rate adjustments are based as a result the yield on an inverse floater class of an agency security will generally increase when market yields as reflected by the index decrease and decrease when market yields increase the extent of the volatility of inverse floaters depends on the extent of anticipated changes in market rates of interest generally inverse floaters provide for interest rate adjustments based upon a multiple of the specified interest index which further increases their volatility the degree of additional volatility will be directly proportional to the size of the multiple used in determining interest rate adjustments lending of portfolio securities in order to generate additional income a fund may lend portfolio securities to securities brokerdealers or financial institutions if  the loan is collateralized in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements including collateralization continuously at no less than  by marking to market daily  the loan is subject to termination by a fund at any time  a fund receives reasonable interest or fee payments on the loan  a fund is able to exercise all voting rights with respect to the loaned securities and  the loan will not cause the value of all loaned securities to exceed onethird of the value of a funds assets if the borrower fails to maintain the requisite amount of collateral the loan automatically terminates and a fund could use the collateral to replace the securities while holding the borrower liable for any excess of replacement cost over the value of the collateral as with any extension of credit there are risks of delay in recovery and in some cases even loss of rights in collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially the international fund does not currently intend to lend portfolio securities in excess of  of its total assets the core equities fund growth opportunity fund fixed income fund and municipal bond fund do not currently intend to lend portfolio securities money market instruments the funds may invest in money market instruments including obligations of the us government and its agencies and instrumentalities other shortterm debt securities commercial paper bank obligations and money market mutual funds mortgagebacked securities fixed income fund may invest in mortgagebacked securities generally homeowners have the option to prepay their mortgages at any time without penalty homeowners frequently refinance high rate mortgages when mortgage rates fall this results in the prepayment of mortgage backed securities which deprives holders of the securities of the higher yields conversely when mortgage rates increase prepayments due to refinancings decline this extends the life of mortgage backed securities with lower yields as a result increases in prepayments of premium mortgage backed securities or decreases in prepayments of discount mortgage backed securities may reduce their yield and price this relationship between interest rates and mortgage prepayments makes the price of mortgage backed securities more volatile than most other types of fixed income securities with comparable credit risks mortgage backed securities tend to pay higher yields to compensate for this volatility collateralized mortgage obligations cmos the following example illustrates how mortgage cash flows are prioritized in the case of cmos  most of the cmos in which the fixed income fund invests use the same basic structure  several classes of securities are issued against a pool of mortgage collateral a common structure may contain four classes of securities the first three a b and c bonds pay interest at their stated rates beginning with the issue date and the final class z bond typically receives any excess income from the underlying investments after payments are made to the other classes and receives no principal or interest payments until the shorter maturity classes have been retired but then receives all remaining principal and interest payments  the cash flows from the underlying mortgages are applied first to pay interest and then to retire securities  the classes of securities are retired sequentially all principal payments are directed first to the shortestmaturity class or a bond when those securities are completely retired all principal payments are then directed to the next shortestmaturity security or b bond this process continues until all of the classes have been paid off because the cash flow is distributed sequentially instead of pro rata as with passthrough securities the cash flows and average lives of cmos are more predictable and there is a period of time during which the investors in the longermaturity classes receive no principal paydowns the interest portion of these payments is distributed by the funds as income and the capital portion is reinvested municipal securities municipal securities are generally issued to finance public works such as airports bridges highways housing hospitals mass transpiration projects schools streets and water and sewer works they are also issued to repay outstanding obligations to raise funds for general operating expenses and to make loans to other public institutions and facilities paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th municipal securities include industrial development bonds issued by or on behalf of public authorities to provide financing aid to acquire sites or construct and equip facilities for privately or publicly owned corporations the availability of this financing encourages these corporations to locate within the sponsoring communities and thereby increases local employment the two principal classifications of municipal securities are general obligation and revenue bonds general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its full faith and credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest interest on and principal of revenue bonds however are payable only from the revenue generated by the facility financed by the bond or other specified sources of revenue revenue bonds do not represent a pledge of credit or create any debt of or charge against the general revenues of a municipality or public authority industrial development bonds are typically classified as revenue bonds municipal leases municipal leases are obligations issued by state and local governments or authorities to finance the acquisition of equipment and facilities and may be considered illiquid they may take the form of a lease an installment purchase contract or a conditional sales contract lease obligations may be limited by municipal charter or the nature of the appropriation for the lease in particular lease obligations may be subject to periodic appropriation if the entity does not appropriate funds for future lease payments the entity cannot be compelled to make such payments furthermore a lease may provide that the participants cannot accelerate lease obligations upon default the participant would only be able to enforce lease payments as they became due in the event of a default or failure of appropriation unless the participation interests are credit enhanced it is unlikely that the participants would be able to obtain an acceptable substitute source of payment variable rate municipal securities the fund may purchase municipal securities that have variable interest rates variable interest rates are ordinarily stated as a percentage of a published interest rate interest rate index or some similar standard such as the day us treasury bill rate many variable rate municipal securities are subject to payment of principal on demand by the fund usually in not more than seven days all variable rate municipal securities will meet the quality standards for the fund municipal bond insurance the municipal bond fund may purchase municipal securities covered by insurance which guarantees the timely payment of principal at maturity and interest on such securities these insured municipal securities are either  covered by an insurance policy applicable to a particular security whether obtained by the issuer of the security or by a third party issuerobtained insurance or  insured under master insurance policies issued by municipal bond insurers which may be purchased by the fund the premiums for the policies may be paid by the fund and the yield on the funds investments may be reduced thereby the fund may require or obtain municipal bond insurance when purchasing municipal securities which would not otherwise meet the funds quality standards the fund may also require or obtain municipal bond insurance when purchasing or holding specific municipal securities when in the opinion of the funds adviser such insurance would benefit the fund for example through improvement of portfolio quality or increased liquidity of certain securities issuerobtained insurance policies are noncancellable and continue in force as long as the municipal securities are outstanding and their respective insurers remain in business if a municipal security is covered by issuerobtained insurance then such security need not be insured by the policies purchased by the fund participation interests the municipal bond fund may purchase participation interests from financial institutions such as commercial banks savings associations and insurance companies these participation interests give the fund an undivided interest in municipal securities the financial institutions from which the fund purchases participation interests frequently provide or secure irrevocable letters of credit or guarantees to assure that the participation interests are of high quality the directors will determine that participation interests meet the prescribed quality standards of the fund preferred stocks have the right to receive specified dividends or distributions before the payment of dividends or distributions on common stock some preferred stocks also participate in dividends and distributions paid on common stock preferred stocks may provide for the issuer to redeem the stock on a specified date the fund may treat such redeemable preferred stock as a fixed income security repurchase agreements a repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser ie a fund acquires a debt security and the seller agrees at the time of the sale to repurchase the obligation at a mutually agreed upon time and price thereby determining the yield during the purchasers holding period this results in a fixed rate of return insulated from market fluctuations during such period the underlying securities are ordinarily us treasury or other government obligations or high quality money market instruments a fund will require that the value of such underlying securities together with any other collateral held by the fund always equals or exceeds the amount of the repurchase obligations of the vendor while the maturities of the underlying securities in repurchase agreement transactions may be more than one year the term of such repurchase agreement will always be less than one year a funds risk is primarily that if the seller defaults the proceeds from the disposition of underlying securities and other collateral for the sellers obligation are less than the repurchase price if the seller becomes bankrupt the fund might be delayed in selling the collateral under the investment company act of  as amended the  act repurchase agreements are considered loans repurchase agreements usually are for short periods such as one week or less but could be longer the funds will not enter into repurchase agreements of a duration of more than seven days if taken together with other illiquid securities more than  of that funds net assets would be so invested under normal market conditions the funds do not intend to purchase repurchase agreements in excess of  of that funds net assets shares of other investment companies the funds may invest their assets in securities of other investment companies as an efficient means of carrying out their investment policies investment companies incur certain expenses such as management fees and therefore any investment by the funds in shares of other investment companies may be subject to such duplicate expenses small and mid capitalization stocks small market companies smallcap companies are those with market capitalizations of  billion or less at the time of growth opportunity funds investment many smallcap companies will have had their securities publicly traded if at all for only a short period of time and will not have had the opportunity to establish a reliable trading pattern through economic cycles investing in small and mid capitalization stocks may involve greater risk than investing in large capitalization stocks and more established companies since they can be subject to greater volatility the price volatility of smallcap companies is relatively higher than larger more mature companies the greater price volatility of smallcap companies may result from the fact that there may be less market liquidity less information publicly available or few investors who monitor the activities of these companies further in addition to exhibiting greater volatility the stocks of smallcap companies may to some degree fluctuate independently of the stocks of large companies that is the stocks of smallcap companies may decline in price as the price of large company stocks rise or vice versa in addition the market prices of these securities may exhibit more sensitivity to changes in industry or general economic conditions some smallcap companies will not have been in existence long enough to experience economic cycles or to know whether they are sufficiently well managed to survive downturns or inflationary periods further a variety of factors may affect the success of a companys business beyond the ability of its management to prepare or compensate for them including domestic and international political developments government trade and fiscal policies patterns of trade and war or other military conflict which may affect particular industries or markets or the economy generally mid capitalization companies midcap companies are those with market capitalizations between  billion and  billion the risks associated with investments in midcap companies are similar to those associated with smallcap companies as discussed above short sales core equities fund may make short sales a short sale occurs when a borrowed security is sold in anticipation of a decline in its price if the decline occurs shares equal in number to those sold short can be purchased at the lower price if the price increases the higher price must be paid the purchased shares are then returned to the original lender risk arises because no loss limit can be placed on the transaction when the fund enters into a short sale assets equal to the market price of the securities sold short or any lesser price at which the fund can obtain such securities are segregated on the funds records and maintained until the fund meets its obligations under the short sale the fund will not sell securities short unless it  owns or has a right to acquire an equal amount of such securities or  has segregated an amount of its other assets equal to the lesser of the market value of the securities sold short or the amount required to acquire such securities the segregated amount will not exceed  of the funds net assets while in a short position the fund will retain the securities rights or segregated assets short selling may accelerate the recognition of gains us government securities the funds may invest in us government securities which include o direct obligations of the us treasury such as us treasury bills notes and bonds o notes bonds and discount notes issued or guaranteed by us government agencies and instrumentalities supported y the full faith and credit of the united states o notes bonds and discount notes of us government agencies or instrumentalities which receive or have access to federal funding and o notes bonds and discount notes of other us government instrumentalities supported by the credit of the instrumentalities some obligations issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the us government are backed by the full faith and credit of the us treasury no assurances can be given that the us government will provide financial support to other agencies or instrumentalities since it is not obligated to do so these instrumentalities are supported by o the issuers right to borrow an amount limited to a specific line of credit from the us treasury o the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase certain obligations of an agency or instrumentality or o the credit of the agency or instrumentality temporary investments each fund may maintain up to  of its assets in money market instruments for temporary defensive purposes this reserve position provides flexibility in meeting redemptions expenses and the timing of new investments and serves as a shortterm defense during periods of unusual market volatility the money market instruments for the core equities growth opportunity and fixed income funds include obligations of the us government and its agencies and instrumentalities other shortterm debt securities which are rated in the two top categories by moodys or sp or if unrated are of comparable quality as determined by the adviser commercial paper bank obligations and money market mutual funds the money market instruments for international fund include domestic and foreign government obligations bank obligations commercial paper and shortterm securities which are rated in the top two categories by moodys or sp or if unrated are of comparable quality as determined by the adviser the money market instruments for municipal bond fund include taxable or taxexempt obligations of the us government and its agencies and instrumentalities shortterm debt securities of municipal or corporate issuers domestic and foreign government obligations bank obligations commercial paper and shortterm securities which are rated in the two top categories by moodys or sp or if unrated of comparable quality as determined by the adviser although municipal bond fund is permitted to take temporary taxable investments there is no current intention of generating income subject to federal regular income tax variable rate demand notes variable rate demand notes are longterm corporate debt instruments that have variable or floating interest rates and provide a fund with the right to tender the security for repurchase at its stated principal amount plus accrued interest such securities typically bear interest at a rate that is intended to cause the securities to trade at par the interest rate may float or be adjusted at regular intervals ranging from daily to annually and is normally based on an interest rate index or a published interest rate many variable rate demand notes allow a fund to demand the repurchase of the security on not more than seven days prior notice other notes only permit a fund to tender the security at the time of each interest rate adjustment or at other fixed intervals warrants give a fund the option to buy the issuers stock or other equity securities at a specified price the fund may buy the designated shares by paying the exercise price before the warrant expires warrants may become worthless if the price of the stock does not rise above the exercise price by the expiration date rights are the same as warrants except they are typically issued to existing stockholders the funds do not intend to purchase warrants and rights in excess of  of each funds total assets whenissued and delayed delivery transactions these transactions are made to secure what is considered to be an advantageous price or yield settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase prices other than normal transaction costs no fees or expenses are incurred however liquid assets of a fund are segregated on a funds records at the trade date in an amount sufficient to make payment for the securities to be purchased these assets are marked to market daily and are maintained until the transaction has been settled zero coupon bonds fixed income fund may invest in zero coupon bonds these are bonds which are sold at a discount to their stated value and do not pay any periodic interest paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th investment restrictions fundamental limitations the following investment limitations are fundamental and cannot be changed without

security and exchange commissions sec standard method for calculating performance applicable to all mutual funds the sec also permits this standard performance information to be accompanied by nonstandard performance information unless otherwise stated any quoted share performance reflects the effect of nonrecurring charges such as maximum sales charges which if excluded would increase the total return and yield the performance of shares depends upon such variables as portfolio quality average portfolio maturity type and value of portfolio securities changes in interest rates changes or differences in the funds expenses and various other factors share performance fluctuates on a daily basis largely because net earnings and offering price per share fluctuate daily both net earnings and offering price per share are factors in the computation of yield and total return total return total return represents the change expressed as a percentage in the value of shares over a specific period of time and includes the investment of income and capital gains distributions the average annual total return for a funds shares is the average compounded rate of return for a given period that would equate a  initial investment to the ending redeemable value of that investment the ending redeemable value is computed by multiplying the number of shares owned at the end of the period by the nav per share at the end of the period the number of shares owned at the end of the period is based on the number of shares purchased at the beginning of the period with  less any applicable sales charge adjusted over the period by any additional shares assuming the annual reinvestment of all dividends and distributions when shares of a fund are in existence for less than a year the fund may advertise cumulative total return for that specific period of time rather than annualizing the total return yield the yield of a funds shares is calculated by dividing i the net investment income per share earned by the shares over a thirtyday period by ii the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period this number is then annualized using semiannual compounding this means that the amount of income generated during the thirtyday period is assumed to be generated each month over a month period and is reinvested every six months the taxequivalent yield of municipal income funds shares is calculated similarly to the yield but is adjusted to reflect the taxable yield that shares would have had to earn to equal the actual yield assuming a specific tax rate the yield and taxequivalent yield do not necessarily reflect income actually earned by shares because of certain adjustments required by the sec and therefore may not correlate to the dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders to the extent financial institutions and brokerdealers charge fees in connection with services provided in conjunction with an investment in a funds shares the funds

impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime

clients including the funds��pursuant to services agreements dated april   pncgis serves as administrator fund accounting agent and transfer agent to the fund company and its portfolios��certain employees of pncgis serve as officers of the fund company��pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated july   distributor serves as the principal underwriter to the fund company and its portfolios pursuant to a custody agreement dated july   between the fund companys custodian bessemer trust company and the bank of new york mellon the bank of new york mellon provides certain subcustodial services to the fund company and all but one of its portfolios �  certain funds currently employ distributor or a subsidiary of distributor as principal underwriter but do not currently engage in transactions but may do so in the future��additionally certain funds do not currently employ distributor or a subsidiary of distributor as principal underwriter but may do so in the future��the relief requested by this application would also apply to future transactions with such funds �  in connection with the transaction described below pnc global investment servicing inc was renamed bny mellon distributors holdings inc effective july   the servicing activities described above are currently provided by bny mellon investment servicing us inc formerly known as pnc global investment servicing us inc��the name pncgis is used herein for ease of reference �  the fund company has engaged citibank na to serve as sole custodian for one portfolio the old westbury global opportunities fund and cocustodian for two other portfolios the old westbury global small  mid cap fund and the old westbury real return fund � �    � prior to july   bny mellon was not affiliated with the fund company distributor or pncgis��before such date from time to time bny mellon engaged in certain principal transactions with the portfolios��for example bny mellon engaged in foreign currency transactions fx transactions with the portfolios��in addition bny mellon through its global markets group from time to time may have acted as counterparty with respect to certain derivatives transactions with the portfolios��moreover bny mellon from time to time may have engaged in other principal transactions with the portfolios and served as a principal underwriter to issuers of which the portfolios could have purchased securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling syndicate ������ on february   the pnc financial services group inc entered into a stock purchase agreement stock purchase agreement with the bank of new york mellon corporation bny mellon corp��upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement the pnc financial services group inc agreed to sell to bny mellon corp  of the issued and outstanding shares of pnc global investment servicing inc an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the pnc financial services group inc the stock sale��the stock sale included pnc global investment servicing us inc pfpc trust company and distributor among other entities��the stock sale was completed on july   the closing date � �    � as a result of the stock purchase agreement and stock sale effective july   the bank of new york mellon and distributor are under the common control of bny mellon corp and therefore may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other for purposes of section a of the investment company act��as of such date bny mellon may be deemed to be prohibited from engaging in certain transactions pursuant to section a of the investment company act because bny mellon is an affiliated person of the fund companys principal underwriter��in addition bny mellon could be deemed to be prohibited from engaging in certain transactions pursuant to section f of the investment company act because officers and employees of bny mellon serve as officers of the fund company �� ����distributor and bny mellon are not directly or indirectly affiliated with the investment adviser or subadviser to any portfolio � ����when the investment company act was enacted the principal underwriter to an investment company almost invariably wielded enormous power over the company because the company was entirely dependent on the principal underwriter for access to investors��this power was particularly pronounced with respect to openend investment companies because such companies often are dependent on the constant sale of new securities to replace assets lost through shareholder redemptions��similarly in  officers of a fund typically were affiliated with an entity that controlled the investment decisions or distribution of the fund generally or at a minimum were in a position to control or influence investment decisions made on behalf of the fund��accordingly congress chose to include principal underwriters and officers of a fund within the class of persons subject to the restrictions of sections a and f of the investment company act � � �    � � unlike the situation that was contemplated when the investment company act was enacted neither bny mellon nor its officers and employees are in any position to control or influence the selection of securities brokers or dealers for the portfolios which decisions are made by an unaffiliated investment adviser and subadvisers��moreover bny mellon has little ability to influence the sale of portfolio shares � the competitive market for distribution services has created the situation where if bny mellon and its subsidiary were replaced as principal underwriter the fund company would not lose access to the channels through which its portfolio shares are sold��rather another brokerdealer simply would assume the responsibility for performing the distribution activities��to this extent bny mellon as underwriter is like the many other service providers to the fund company who similarly have no meaningful power to control or influence investment adviser decisions��in any event the shares of the portfolios are used as asset allocation vehicles for fiduciary clients of bessemer trust company na and its affiliates notwithstanding the lack of affiliation between bny mellon and the persons responsible for making investment decisions the absence of leverage that bny mellon has over the fund company as its underwriter and the lack of any opportunity for bny mellon to influence the securities activities of the fund company and its portfolios as of the completion of the stock sale the portfolios are prohibited from engaging in transactions with bny mellon�� �    � � applicants submit that it does not serve the best interests of the fund company or the portfolios by prohibiting them from engaging in transactions with bny mellon and therefore seek the relief requested in this application ��������the fund company has on behalf of the portfolios independently decided to retain bny mellon to provide distribution services as well as the other services provided to the fund company by bny mellon��as with all business relationships the retention of the distributor was based on a number of factors including the confidence that the fund companys adviser and board have in bny mellon based on several years of regular business dealings with bny mellon the nature of the services required bny mellons ability to perform the required services and the cost of the services��in this regard the fund company and portfolios have been in operation for a number of years and have utilized the distributor as their principal underwriter since  ������� the board of the fund company including all of the disinterested members has determined that the distribution arrangements with bny mellon are in the best interests of the portfolios��that determination was based on an evaluation of several factors including the ones described above���certainly it would be possible for the portfolios to employ an underwriter that is unaffiliated with bny mellon��this would obviate the need for the requested relief with respect to the transactions��however the fund companys board and adviser which both have no incentive to select bny mellon as principal underwriter but do have incentives to select the most effective underwriter for the benefit of the portfolios have selected bny mellon based on an evaluation of the factors described above � �    � � i�����������relevant parties and their relationships � a�����������bny mellon � established in  bny mellon corp was formed when mellon financial corporation a year old leading asset management firm merged with year old the bank of new york company inc to create an international company which specializes in asset servicing and management with offices in new york and the financial capitals of the world��certain entities of bny mellon are registered under the securities exchange act of  the  act as brokerdealers or in some cases are exempt from registration as such but act as dealers and agents to the extent permitted by sections ab and ac of the  act in the placement or trading of securities and other instruments��in addition to buying and selling securities as a broker and principal bny mellon is engaged in asset servicing through its offering of global custody global fund services securities lending global liquidation services and creditrelated services to institutional clients eg mutual funds public retirement funds etc��bny mellon provides such services to over  trillion in assets under custody or administration making it one of the leading asset services providers in the world as custodian or subcustodian bny mellon provides complete domestic andor global custody services using the industrys first single multicurrency systems platform in more

  � � a�����������the fx transactions � from time to time at the direction of bim or the subadvisers a portfolio enters into fx transactions in connection with its assets held by bny mellon��broadly speaking fx transactions are effected where the portfolio holds positions or engages in transactions which involve a currency other than the us dollar foreign currency��in connection with such transactions the portfolio will effect an fx transaction to convert the foreign currency into the us dollar or vice versa��for example an fx transaction is effected where a portfolio receives payments in a foreign currency with respect to securities held by the portfolio or where a portfolio requires foreign currency to settle transactions in securities denominated in a foreign currency��as described more fully below it is customary within the mutual fund industry that certain fx transactions are directed to an entity providing custodial services to a fund custodial service provider due to its expertise resources or because of administrative convenience a funds investment adviser or subadviser can direct fx transactions on behalf of the fund in one of two ways a entering into fx transactions with noncustodial service provider third parties and b entering into fx transactions with custodial service providers acting as a principal either by directly negotiating such transactions with a custodial service provider or by giving standing instructions to a custodial service provider to act as principal in certain fx transactions with the fund��the size and nature of the fx transaction typically factor into the investment advisers determination in this regard��for example to the extent that the investment adviser determines to hedge a funds currency exposure through the use of a foreign currency forward transaction or to enter into a particular fx transaction that affects a significant portion of the funds holdings the investment adviser may determine to directly negotiate the fx transaction with the counterparty which may or may not be a custodial service provider � �    � in contrast it is common for investment advisers or subadvisers to direct other types of fx transactions � in addition to the fx transactions described immediately above � to a custodial service provider��these other types of fx transactions may include the following a transactions that are of relatively low value and that have relatively high administrative burdens associated with them such as the conversion of dividends paid in a foreign currency foreign tax reclaims or corporate actions such as rights subscriptions or dividend reinvestment plans and b transactions in socalled regulated markets such as malaysia india brazil and korea among others��these are jurisdictions where local restrictions present hurdles to effecting transactions on a timely basis��the use of a custodial service provider which may have staff resident in the local market as well as expertise with respect to local restrictions often is the most effective means of executing such transactions��for these types of transactions the use of noncustodial service provider third parties may present additional cost additional administrative burdens and expose the fund to certain operational risks all of which may serve to limit the investment advisers ability to efficiently and successfully execute the transaction for the fund � prior to the closing date the portfolios engaged in fx transactions with bny mellon acting as principal � ����  there are inherent efficiencies from centralizing to the extent feasible a funds fx transactions��the use of a noncustodial service provider requires coordination among the adviser or subadviser the custodian and the counterparty��in addition a noncustodial service provider may not have the same capability in terms of global reach as the custodian��the greater the number of counterparties with which a fund engages in fx transactions the greater the oversight burden and the greater the number of parties to be contacted to reconcile any transaction discrepancies � � �    � � b�����������the derivative transactions bny mellon through its global markets group enters into certain derivative transactions as principal with its customers��the derivative instruments include interest rate swaps equity options and instruments relating to foreign currency��the global markets group does not engage in credit or commodity related derivative instruments prior to the closing date the portfolios from time to time may have engaged in such derivative transactions with bny mellon c�����������other principal transactions the portfolios may from time to time seek to engage in other transactions with bny mellon acting as i a dealer with respect to equity and fixedincome instruments including municipal securities bank loans and loan participations or ii a lender or borrower of securities��for example pershing llc pershing a registered brokerdealer and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of bny mellon corp provides clearance custody and execution services to financial intermediaries��in connection with these services pershing performs certain activities that may involve engaging in transactions directly or indirectly with the portfolios��such activities include but are not limited to acting as a market maker with respect to over  equity securities acting as dealer with respect to fixedincome instruments and acting as a lender of securities��pershing may also borrow securities from funds that participate in securities lending programs��a fund may pursue short sales as part of their investment strategies and therefore be in a position in which the funds adviser or subadviser would cause the fund to borrow securities from bny mellon �  the derivative instruments consist principally of interest rate swaps equity options and instruments relating to foreign currency��funds engage in these transactions for portfoliomanagement reasons to protect or enhance a funds return��these instruments are part of the advisers or subadvisers investment strategy and therefore are deemed by the adviser or subadviser necessary for better fund performance��the funds could engage in the derivative transactions with an entity that is unaffiliated with bny mellon��this would obviate the need for the requested relief with respect to the derivative transactions��however the funds adviser or subadvisers have no incentive to benefit bny mellon but do have strong incentives to direct derivative transactions for the benefit of the funds would choose to direct these transactions to bny mellon based on bny mellons minimal counterparty risk and the costs incurred and quality of service received by the funds in choosing bny mellon �  the portfolios do not engage in securities lending activities � �    � d�����������the underwriting transactions bny mellon through its subsidiaries provides underwriting services to entities seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of their securities��as an underwriter bny mellon facilitates an issuing entitys capitalraising activities by identifying and locating potential investors and then also arranging for the purchase of the entitys securities by such investors during the offering or syndication period � the portfolios may from time to time seek to acquire securities during their underwriting or syndication period where bny mellon serves as underwriter to the securities � iii�����������relief requested and applicable law � pursuant to sections c f and b applicants request the order from the commission exempting them from sections a and f of the investment company act and allowing bny mellon and the portfolios to enter into transactions in the ordinary course of business subject to the representations and conditions contained in this application � a�����������section a � sections a and a of the investment company act respectively generally prohibit any affiliated person of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to such registered investment company and from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company��in addition section a of the investment company act generally prohibits any affiliated person of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter acting as principal from borrowing money or other property from such registered investment company����lastly section a of the investment company act prohibits any affiliated person of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter acting as principal from loaning money or other property to such registered investment company in contravention of such rules regulations or orders as the commission may prescribe or issue consistent with the protection of investors��because as of the completion of the stock sale bny mellon is an affiliate of the fund companys underwriter distributor bny mellon may not knowingly engage in principal transactions with the portfolios absent an exemptive order �  to date the commission has not prescribed or issued any such rules regulations or orders��the applicants are not seeking exemptive relief from section a � � �    � although officers and employees of bny mellon act as officers of the fund company as of the completion of the stock sale bny mellon believes that it is not a secondtier affiliate of the fund company by virtue of such relationships��section a of the investment company act provides that � affiliated person of another person means a any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with the power to vote  per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person b any person  per centum or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned controlled or held with power to vote by such other person c any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person d any officer director partner copartner or employee of such other person e if such other person is an investment company any investment adviser thereof or member of an advisory board thereof and f if such other person is an unincorporated investment company not having a board of directors the depositor thereof � the officers of the fund company are affiliated persons of the fund company pursuant to section ad��such persons also are affiliated persons of bny mellon under section ad � but the opposite is not true bny mellon is not an affiliated person of its employees or officers��section ad states that an officer is an affiliated person of his company and that an employee is an affiliated person of its employer��no portion of section a provides the opposite ie that an employer is an affiliated person of its employees or that a company is an affiliated person of its officers��the fact that the drafters of the investment company act knew that affiliation could run in a single direction is evidenced by the fact that subsections a and b were both included � each of which covers the opposite side of the same set of relationships � �    � of course bny mellon could be an affiliated person of its employees or officers by virtue of section ac if it were deemed to control such persons in which case it would be a secondtier affiliated person of the fund company��however section a of the investment company act defines the term in the context of control over companies providing in relevant part that � control means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company � to underscore the fact that control is a concept primarily intended to be applied outside of the context of natural persons section a further provides that a natural person shall be presumed not to be a controlled person within the meaning of the investment company act � b�����������sections b and c � section b of the investment company act authorizes the commission to issue an order of exemption from one or more of the provisions of section a if evidence establishes that  the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned  the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and  the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the investment company act � �    � � to the extent that applicants seek relief for a series of future transactions the commission has the authority under section c of the investment company act to exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision or provisions of the investment company act or from any rule or regulation thereunder if and to the extent such exemption is �necessary or appropriate in the public interest �consistent with the protection of investors and �consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the investment company act � c�����������section  f � section f of the investment company act in relevant part prohibits a registered investment company from knowingly purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security during its underwriting or syndication the principal underwriter of which is a an officer director member of an advisory board investment adviser or employee of the investment company or b a person of which such officer director member of any advisory board investment adviser or employee is an affiliated person��as of the stock sale officers and employees of bny mellon serve as officers of the fund company��currently no such person is an affiliated person of a bny mellon entity that provides underwriting services��to the extent that such person in the future is an affiliated person of a bny mellon entity that provides underwriting services section f may be deemed to prohibit the portfolios from acquiring securities from bny mellon during the securities underwriting or syndication period when bny mellon serves as underwriter of the securities��section f also authorizes the commission to exempt any transactions or classes of transactions from its restrictions � �    � � iv�����������reasons for requested relief � a�����������section a � applicants respectfully submit that the abuses that section a of the investment company act was designed to redress are not implicated by the transactions��section a was fashioned by congress to prevent an underwriter or other party with the power to influence the investment decisions of a registered investment company from inducing the investment company to engage in transactions that unfairly benefit the underwriter but are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders��although bny mellon through distributor serves as underwriter for the fund company and its portfolios and has employees that are officers but not directors of the fund company bny mellon does not exercise influence or control over the investment decisions and investment policies of the portfolios and is not in a position to exert pressure on the portfolios or their investment advisers to engage in transactions that are not in the portfolios best interests��applicants also submit that the trading bar between bny mellon and the portfolios imposed by section a disadvantages the portfolios by preventing them from engaging in transactions with a reputable and well regarded firm and in particular with respect to fx transactions preventing the portfolios from realizing the benefits of directing fx transactions to bny mellon a leading provider of fx transactionrelated services��section as bar prevents a fund from lending securities to bny mellon in securities lending transactions � �    � � �  the proposed principal transactions between the funds and bny mellon do not raise the concerns that section a was designed to address � � a the domination of distribution � congress passed section a of the investment company act to address the problems associated with transactions of affiliated persons and underwriters or distributors who are able to control or influence the investment decisions of mutual funds��as explained by david schenker chief counsel of the commission study that led to the enactment of the investment company act the purpose of this provision was to ensure that if you are a person or entity providing services to a mutual fund you would not be in a situation in which you are sitting on one side representing yourself where you have a pecuniary interest and you are sitting on the other side representing the investment trust��investment trusts and investment companies hearings on s  before a subcomm of the senate comm on banking and currency th cong d sess   testimony of chief counsel schenker congress applied the prohibitions of section a to underwriters of investment company shares because at the time of the enactment of the investment company act underwriters possessed enormous control over investment companies��the commission in its exhaustive investment trust study of the thenlargely unregulated investment company industry devoted over  pages exclusively to the problems associated with underwriter control of openend and closedend investment company shares��the commission encapsulated these problems with the ominous heading the domination of distribution��sec investment trusts and investment companies   � �    � the commissions study which served as the foundation for the investment company act noted that in the s most openend investment companies were sponsored by persons closely connected with the subsequent distribution of their shares and practically all these companies were managed by the same persons��id at ��the contracts between the parties reflected that relationship between the underwriter and the fund containing terms that strongly favored the underwriter��the commission highlighted a typical distribution contractual relationship that among other things appointed the underwriter as the exclusive selling agent for more than  years and thereafter from yeartoyear until terminated upon  months notice entitled the underwriter to a sales load of  percent of the retail price of shares and mandated that the investment company provide current fund information for the use of the underwriter��id at  � as this contract shows investment companies frequently were captives of underwriters and their affiliated persons��yet the control of the underwriter went beyond the terms of the contract because as the commission noted the underwriter was the focal point for the purchase and sale of shares��id at ��this concern was particularly pronounced for openend investment companies because such companies must constantly sell new securities to replace assets lost through shareholder redemptions � sales of investment company shares could not be accomplished without the underwriters aid for it was underwriters and their dealers that provided the large nationwide organizations that would actively promote funds��vigorous sales efforts � employing almost every merchandising device from doortodoor sales to extensive advertisements in newspapers magazines and radios � were utilized �    � � by dealers and underwriters see id at  and funds lacking such distribution support would not be viable for very long��accordingly funds could be pressured to embark on many devices or practices that favored the underwriter to assure the continued sale of their securities��id at  in enacting the investment company act congress recognized that this underwriter domination and control of investment funds could result in abuses against mutual funds and their investors��congress addressed this domination in part when it enacted section  of the investment company act to among other things limit the ability of a principal underwriter to impose longterm distribution agreements on investment companies��section  however did not and could not eliminate the de facto power of thenexisting underwriters over mutual funds arising from their control over the sale of fund shares��to assure that this power was not abused congress applied to underwriters the trading proscription of section a of the investment company act subject to the ability of the commission to grant exemptions from that proscription � � b bny mellon lacks influence or control over the funds to cause them to engage in the type of conduct that section a sought to bar � although as of the stock sale bny mellon through its subsidiary distributor serves as underwriter for the fund company and its portfolios and its employees function as officers of the fund company bny mellon does not have the type of control or influence that concerned congress and the commission in  at the time of the passage of the investment company act � �    � � section b of the investment company act prohibits a mutual fund except a fund meeting the requirements of section d of the investment company act from distributing its shares except through an underwriter in contravention of rules prescribed by the commission under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act associated persons of a mutual fund issuer who participate in the sale of the funds shares normally would be deemed to be brokers subject to the brokerdealer registration requirements of the exchange act��therefore most funds contract with a principal underwriter as defined in section a of the investment company act to avoid this problem��however the scope of services provided by the typical mutual fund underwriter providing the usual range of distributionrelated services as contemplated by the drafters of the investment company act a fullservice underwriter and limitedpurpose underwriters such as the distributor differs significantly � in  the staff considered an application for exemption from sections a and f of the investment company act on behalf of the benchmark funds the commerce funds and goldman sachs  co the benchmark application���as explained in the benchmark application the applicant funds retained goldman sachs  co goldman as nominal underwriter because thenapplicable�  rule a under the exchange act provides an exception to this registration requirement��however rule as limits on the activities that a person seeking to rely on the rule may undertake is restrictive��accordingly most fund families choose to contract with a principal underwriter as defined in section a of the act which is a registered brokerdealer under the exchange act to effect the distribution of fund shares �  see the benchmark funds investment company act rel nos  nov   notice and  dec   order � � �    � � � provisions of the glasssteagall act and federal banking regulations were interpreted as prohibiting the bank sponsors of the benchmark funds and the commerce funds and the banks parentsholding companies from distributing shares of the applicant funds��while the glasssteagall act and federal banking restrictions underlying the benchmark application do not apply to the applicants the services that the distributor provides to the funds do not extend beyond those performed by goldman��as discussed below the policy rationale that led the commission to issue the order requested in the benchmark application also supports the issuance of the order the following table compares the services provided by the distributor and the services provided by goldman in the benchmark application � � �  see benchmark application at  � � �    � service distributor provided goldman provided � named as distributor in agreements with funds yes yes named as distributor in fund prospectuses and sales literature yes yes monitor compliance with blue sky laws and regulations involving the issuance and sale of mutual fund shares no yes enter into agreements with intermediaries that will sell fund

services that are typical for a distributor yes yes �  indicates an activity identified in the benchmark application as an activity that the office of the comptroller of the currency could be performed by a nominal third party distributor and still comply with the glasssteagall act see benchmark application at  which the benchmark application does not expressly indicate was performed by goldman �  service is provided by an affiliate of the distributor �  in the case of the distributor these activities principally consist of registering with finra those employees of a funds adviser or its affiliates whose activities require finra registration and providing supervision of these persons with respect to understanding and complying with finra rules��however the funds adviser controls and directs the��sales activities of these persons��in the case of the fund company there are no employees of bim the subadvisers or any of their affiliates who are registered with the distributor as sales personnel � � �    � it is important to note that in no sense are the funds captives of the distributor either as a matter of contract or as discussed below influence��as the next section demonstrates the distributors limited scope of services means that the distributor is not a fullservice underwriter as understood by the drafters of the investment company act and therefore the distributors provision of these limitedpurpose underwriter services does not give rise to the policy concerns associated with fullservice underwriters which underlie the inclusion of principal underwriter within the scope of section a of the act and which are described below � � c distinguishing fullservice underwriters from limitedpurpose underwriters � as described above most funds contract with a principal underwriter as defined in section a of the investment company act to avoid broker registration issues under the exchange act��however the scope of services provided by fullservice underwriters and limitedpurpose underwriters such as the distributor differs dramatically � both a fullservice underwriter and a limitedpurpose underwriter usually offer the following services to a family of funds � � � entering into agreements with financial intermediaries brokerdealers banks which will offer fund shares to their respective customers each an intermediary � � � facilitating the payments of sales loads rule b fees and shareholder servicing compensation to the intermediaries and � � �    � � � � reviewing advertisements and other promotional material to help assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and providing regulatory supervision of sales personnel to the extent there are sales personnel � however in contrast to a fullservice underwriter a limitedpurpose underwriter does not as a matter of contract or practice take responsibility for the sale of fund shares��because a fullservice underwriter does take such responsibility a fullservice underwriter typically will as examples provide salespersons who i call upon each intermediarys sales representatives to provide information about the family of funds ii create and provide sales materials and software applications to assist the intermediarys sales representatives in the sale of the funds shares to the intermediarys customers and iii in general service the needs of the intermediarys sales representatives in addition to salespersons who call upon the intermediarys sales representatives a fullservice underwriter often will provide socalled internal wholesalers who provide backup sales support by staffing phones and responding to requests from each intermediarys sales representatives � �  as was the case in the benchmark application the distribution agreement with the fund company does not specifically preclude the distributor from soliciting purchases of shares of the portfolios��the distribution agreement also provides that the distributor will use efforts deemed appropriate by the distributor to solicit orders for shares and will undertake promotion or advertising as requested by the portfolios��however applicants do not interpret the distribution agreement as imposing any requirement on the distributor to locate investors for the portfolios � �    � a fullservice underwriter is typically a dedicated business unit that is an affiliated person of the fund adviser��thus fullservice underwriters are directly involved with the sales and promotion of the funds shares in contrast a limitedpurpose underwriter plays no role in promoting the funds to retail or institutional customers and does not employ sales personnel��instead when a fund contracts with a limitedpurpose underwriter the funds investment adviser is responsible for marketing fund shares to investors and intermediaries��because the activities of the employees of the adviser would require that these persons be associated persons of a registered brokerdealer these individuals are associated persons of and are supervised by the funds limitedpurpose underwriter with respect to compliance with finra requirements and applicable laws and regulations��however the limitedpurpose underwriter is not responsible for controlling or directing the sales activities of these associated persons as a limitedpurpose underwriter bny mellon is consequently not in a position vis�vis the portfolios to perpetrate the type of abuse that section a was designed to prevent��as described below these concerns exist with respect to fullservice underwriters who are in a position to abuse the power they possess over funds due to their role as the focal point for the purchase and sale of funds shares��the applicants believe that these policy concerns do not exist with respect to limitedpurpose underwriters such as the distributor whose role in the sale of funds shares is limited to regulatory compliance and administrative matters � �    � � �  bny mellon does not control fund investment decisions � neither bny mellon nor as discussed in greater detail below its officers and employees are in any position to control or influence the investment activities of any portfolio of the fund company��investment decisions for each of the portfolios are made exclusively by the investment adviser to the portfolio or its subadvisers which are unaffiliated with bny mellon��the fund company has entered into an investment advisory contract with bim to act as investment adviser to the portfolios��it is not the intent of the fund company to also engage bny mellon as an investment adviser for any portfolio relying on this application � bny mellon does not play any role in determining which categories of securities or specific securities are purchased or sold by the portfolios or the counterparty to any portfolio in any securities lending transaction��there is no express or implied understanding that bim will cause any of the portfolios to enter into purchase or sale transactions with bny mellon and neither the portfolios nor bim would give any preference to bny mellon as a broker or dealer when effecting purchase or sale transactions for the portfolios or securities lending transactions for the portfolios � given this lack of any influence or control there is no policy reason for precluding the portfolios from engaging in transactions with bny mellon��as stated by the staff in a  noaction letter to salomon brothers concerning whether to apply the socalled collapsing entity doctrine to treat salomon brothers and an advisory affiliate as a single entity � �  the commission has noted that section a is intended primarily to proscribe a purchase or sale transaction when a party to the transaction has both the ability and the pecuniary incentive to influence the actions of the investment company see investment company act release no  oct   citing investment trusts and investment companies hearings on s  before a subcomm of the senate comm on banking and currency th cong d sess at � ��applicants submit that the distributor has neither the ability nor the incentive to influence the actions of the funds � �    � � moreover we agree that under the circumstances presented there do not appear to be any policy reasons that would require that salomon and the salomon entities be treated as a single entity��section  was intended to prevent insiders from using an investment company to benefit themselves to the detriment of the company and its shareholders��you represent that because salomon will engage in principal transactions with funds and portfolios that are advised by persons not affiliated with salomon or any salomon adviser salomon will not be in a position to cause these funds and portfolios to engage in the proposed transactions � although the foregoing statement was made in a slightly different context applicants submit that the same policy applies equally to the instant situation � �  bny mellons officers and employees play no role in investment decisions � although bny mellons officers and employees serve as officers of the fund company none of those persons are employed or otherwise affiliated with the portfolios investment adviser or subadvisers serve as directors of the fund company or participate in any aspect of the advisers or subadvisers selection of investments brokerdealers or securities lending counterparty or the purchase and sale of securities none of bny mellons officers or employees are responsible for the formulation or establishment of the portfolios investment objectives policies or restrictions��the officers and employees function only as administrative officers of the fund company handling administrative tasks necessary to maintain the fund company as a going concern such as preparing the agendas and minutes of board meetings drafting correspondence signing routine regulatory filings and supervising as needed recordkeeping and accounting��the performance of these functions by bny mellons personnel does not result in any opportunity for underwriter control of the portfolios andor fund company��we note that the federal reserve reached this very conclusion albeit in a somewhat different statutory context��in approving a banks acquisition of a fund administrator the federal reserve wrote permitting a bank holding company ���to provide the essentially ministerial or supporting functions as administrator to a fund would not significantly increase the ability of the bank holding company to control the mutual fund � �  salomon brothers inc sec noact letter avail may   footnotes omitted �  the commission subsequently codified this position by adopting rule a and by amending rule f both under the investment company act��see transactions of investment companies with portfolio and subadviser affiliates investment company act release no  adopting release january   investment company act release

accounting��the performance of these functions by bny mellons personnel does not result in any opportunity for underwriter control of the portfolios andor fund company��we note that the federal reserve reached this very conclusion albeit in a somewhat different statutory context��in approving a banks acquisition of a fund administrator the federal reserve wrote permitting a bank holding company ���to provide the essentially ministerial or supporting functions as administrator to a fund would not significantly increase the ability of the bank holding company to control the mutual fund� the policymaking functions of the fund company rest with their independent board of directors which has been and will continue to be responsible for the selection and review of the major contractors to the fund company including the advisers and the underwriter��bny mellons officers and employees do not and will not serve as members of the fund companys board of directors and consequently will not be engaged in considering and approving the fund companys advisory and distribution arrangements � �  additional fund services do not result in bny mellons control of fund investment decisions � bny mellon through its affiliated persons provides certain fund services additional services to the portfolios but the additional services do not increase bny mellons power or ability to influence the portfolios or the portfolios independent adviser and the subadvisers��this conclusion is supported by the fact that their status as providers of additional services does not i place these bny mellon service providers within the provisions of section  of the investment company act ii make these service providers affiliated persons of the funds as defined in section a of the investment company act or iii subject the service providers to a fiduciary duty under section a of the investment company act �  bny mellon or its affiliated persons serve as fund administrator accounting agent transfer agent or custodian � �    � the portfolios adviser bim and the subadvisers have no incentive to benefit bny mellon and faces strong incentives to direct transactions to bny mellon only when the adviser andor the subadvisers believe the transactions are in the portfolios best interests��moreover there is vigorous competition in the fund services industry among bny mellon and its competitors to provide limitedpurpose underwriter services fund administration services and the additional services��if the services provided by bny mellon to a fund are not priced competitively bim or the other advisers have every incentive to negotiate lower prices andor change service providers bim and the subadvisers are unaffiliated with bny mellon and lack any incentive to disadvantage the portfolios simply to benefit bny mellon��in fact bim and the subadvisers have a strong incentive to see that the portfolios are not overreached by the distributor or the additional services providers in order to enhance each portfolios respective investment performance��enhanced performance may lead to asset growth for the portfolios which may result in greater advisory fees to bim and the subadvisers because they are compensated based upon the portfolios assets under management the fund services business in which the bny mellon additional services providers compete consists of very large and wellfinanced institutions that provide a similar suite of services to fund families��the fund services industry is a competitive industry and this competition effectively prevents fund services providers from obtaining heightened power or ability to influence the portfolios or the portfolios adviser or subadvisers � �    � the facts described above demonstrate that bny mellons provision of limited purpose underwriting services together with the additional services does not heighten bny mellons power or ability to influence the portfolios or the portfolios adviser � �  the ability to engage in principal transactions with bny mellon would benefit the funds � because the transactions would not implicate any of the concerns that led to the enactment of section a the inability of the portfolios to engage in the transactions does not serve the fund companys or its portfolios best interests��by applying the section a restriction to transactions with bny mellon after the stock sale the portfolios may be prevented from effecting transactions on the most favorable terms for the portfolios and with the least amount of administrative burdens as described above certain types of fx transactions are typically directed to a funds custodial service provider due to compelling factors including cost administrative convenience and resources and expertise��if the portfolios cannot engage bny mellon as principal to effect an fx transaction the portfolios may be disadvantaged for the reasons discussed in section ii above � �    � in the case of the derivative transactions and other principal transactions described in section ii above applicants submit that bim should not be foreclosed from engaging on behalf of the portfolios in such transactions with bny mellon as principal where section as policy concerns are not implicated and i an independent party with a vested interested in portfolio performance is making all investment decisions for the portfolio and ii the fund company and its portfolios are in no way dependent on the distribution services of bny mellon � b�����������section f � to the extent that an affiliated person of a bny mellon entity that provides underwriting services to issuers serves as an officer of the portfolios under section f the portfolios would be restricted from acquiring securities from bny mellon during the securities underwriting or syndication period��unlike section a which at least nominally applies to transactions with the principal underwriter of an investment company the only reason that section f would apply is because officers of the fund company are affiliated persons of the bny mellon entity that participates in the underwriting��section f applies to any person of which an officer of a fund is an affiliated person��yet the reason for applying this prohibition to officers of the fund company � the control and influence that an officer may have over the investment decisions of a portfolio � simply does not apply��fund company officers employed by bny mellon perform purely administrative nonadvisory functions��nonetheless the fund company and its portfolios would be deprived of full access to the securities of which bny mellon is an underwriter��as described in detail above in connection with section a bny mellon exercises no control or influence over the investment decisions or policies of the portfolios and it is not in a position to exert pressure on the portfolios to buy securities that it is underwriting � �    � � v�����������proposed conditions � applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions � �����������the distributor will provide only the services of a limitedpurpose underwriter to any fund relying on the order � �����������personnel of the distributor and of each bny mellon entity that provides administrative transfer agency fund accounting or custody services to a fund will not directly or indirectly consult with any funds adviser subadvisers or any portfolio manager of the adviser or subadvisers concerning securities purchases or sales or the selection of a broker or dealer for any transaction placed or to be placed on behalf of a fund or otherwise seek to influence such purchases or sales or the choice of broker or dealer for any transaction by a fund��such services providers will adopt compliance policies and procedures designed to assure compliance with this condition � �����������each funds board including a majority of its disinterested directorstrustees shall approve and the fund shall implement compliance policies and procedures governing all transactions pursuant to the order��such policies and procedures shall require that the board receive at each regularly scheduled quarterly meeting a report by the funds chief compliance officer which reviews transactions effected during the previous quarter and confirms that the conditions of the order have been satisfied � �    � ������������ ������������ �����������neither bny mellon nor its affiliated persons will engage in principal transactions with any series of a fund for which bny mellon or any of its affiliated persons act as investment adviser or subadviser except to the extent permitted by an exemptive order separate from the order or by statute rule or noaction letter ������������ �����������bny mellon and its affiliated persons will engage in principal transactions with any series of a fund in reliance on the order only if neither bny mellon nor any affiliated person of bny mellon is i affiliated with any investment adviser or subadviser to the series or ii responsible for the selection of particular securities to be acquired for the series or iii responsible for the selection of any particular brokerdealer or other counterparty for transactions effected by the series ����������� �����������bny mellon and its affiliated persons will engage in principal transactions with any series of a fund in reliance on the order only if no affiliated person of bny mellon serves as a director of the fund ����������� �����������each transaction between bny mellon or its affiliated persons and a fund made in reliance on the order will be effected only in an armslength transaction with the fund acting through its investment adviser subadvisers or other person unaffiliated with bny mellon and will be consistent with the policy of the fund � ���������� � �    � on the basis of the foregoing applicants submit that the terms and conditions set forth herein are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person that they are consistent with the policy of the fund company and its portfolios that they are consistent with the general purposes of the investment company act in general and sections a and f in particular and that the requested exemption is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the investment company act � vi�����������precedent � the requested relief is substantially similar to relief previously granted by the commission��see eg the benchmark funds investment company act rel nos  november   notice and  december   order��in addition analogous relief from the provisions of section a has been granted by the commission to allow certain series or portfolios of investment companies to engage in principal transactions in the ordinary course of business with securities dealers that may be deemed to be affiliated persons of affiliated persons of the investment companies solely because of the investment companies downstream affiliation ie through ownership of  percent or more with a fund which has an adviser that is under common control with the securities dealers see goldman sachs  co investment company act rel nos  march   order and  february   notice and because of a subadvisory relationship with one or more of those investment companies series or portfolios��see eg hercules funds��inc investment company act rel nos  june   notice and  july   order goldman sachs
