of consolidating industries can be profitablesteamboat capital showed lifevantage’s precarious future as its multilevelmarketing sales appear to peakjoseph kinnison identified almost family as the strongest acquirer in an industry ripe for consolidation dear readers this weeks outstanding performance awards demonstrate how experience and an eye toward industry dynamics can reveal opportunities one is a multilevelmarketing firm with a pricey product at distributor apogee the other is an industry roll up and corporate event thesis both cases show the value of experience in the first case the knowledge of the historical sales patterns of multilevelmarketing companies in the second case knowledge of how value can be created within industries facing consolidation this weeks outstanding performance award winners are steamboat capital for his short idea on lifevantage nasdaqlfvn published december  return to date  joseph kinnison for his long idea on almost family nasdaqafam published april  return to date  both authors have updated their articles with a comment on the original article here and here both articles are part of the sa pro equity research archive available exclusively to sa pro subscribers but will be made available to all readers for  hours in honor of their winning the award about steamboat capital steamboat capital partners was founded in  by parsa kiai prior to steamboat parsa spent four years as a partner at sonterra capital involved in research and the investment process before sonterra parsa was an analyst at perry capital where he provided coverage of the energy sector he worked as an analyst in the investment banking division at goldman sachs  co and is a graduate of cornell university performance award case study  lifevantage steamboat capitals short thesis on lifevantage is a classic mlmatpeak thesis multilevel marketing companies due to their recruitment and direct sales strategy tend to experience rapid growth as the distributor network is built up as new distributors realize the difficulty in obtaining new sales and recruits sales frequently experience a rapid fall off as distributors leave the system this pattern has been repeated before wake up now otcpkworc peaked in  blyths nysebth visalus division peaked in  fortune hitech marketing experienced a  peak and going back further in time herbalife nysehlf had a pop and drop as it is called in  steamboat established that since q  sales growth and distributor count had slowed the quarter before steamboats article the distributor count flat lined after rapid growth given that distributor recruitment is key to growth this boded poorly for future sales which as it happens had already been flat for some  quarters previously adding to this some basic research regarding the product and steamboat was able to demonstrate a significant markup threatening the products longterm viability a number of red flags were also identified first the legal shell had a mixed history with a very general original purpose of obtaining capital to take advantage of business opportunities secondly a preponderance of studies backing their products were undertaken and associated with the companys largest personal shareholder naturally this would appear to be a conflict of interest third strong insider selling including through a tender at  paid with debt suggest mixed beliefs at the very least in the longterm viability of the business see the authors update here and take a look at the share price since publication about joseph kinnison joseph kinnison has  years of experience as a research director and portfolio manager most recently he joined jag capital management llc as director of equity research kinnison kicked off his time on seeking alpha with the following great call on almost family and has also achieved strong returns with his long recommendation on momenta pharmaceuticals nasdaqmnta performance award case study  almost family joseph kinnisons long thesis on almost family is consolidation and corporate event thesis the home healthcare industry he points out was being targeted for cost reductions by cms kinnison argues that with regulatory costs set to rise and reimbursements set to decline the industry will likely enter into a consolidation period some of which had already begun jobs had been lost in the industry congressional staffers projected more losses and the writing was on the wall this brings us to almost family whose ceo said in the fy earnings release before kinnisons article emphasis added we are equally confident that the company is very well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that will inevitably present themselves over this timeframe our development activities over the last half of the year capped by our significant acquisition of suncrest in december demonstrate our strong belief in the future compared to some of its public competitors  like gentiva health services nasdaqgtiv and lhc group nasdaqlhcg  kinnison established that almost family has been the best buyer in the group not only did they pay the least for each dollar of sales by a large margin they also purchased a firm sitting in the sweet spot of growth for the industry all these items set up an attractive situation with kinnison encapsulating the thesis by saying being profitable and having low leverage afam appears to be well positioned to execute a consolidation especially compared to peer companies the market share leader amedisys nasdaqamed is not profitable and gentiva a fellow acquirer has nearly  billion in debt about  times their equity adding in a discounted valuation relative to the industry kinnison argues and the roll up candidate was attractive as the year progressed there was a multiple expansion in afams stock as their acquisition was integrated adding about  to the share price the stock leaped further following strong q  earnings and the announcement of the willcare acquisition in february this acquisition though pricier than their  acquisitions was still at a discount compared to other acquisitions and further enhanced their strategic position have a read of kinnisons update following the most recent acquisition announcement the stock rallied another  bringing the final return since the article to  afam data by ycharts congratulations to this weeks winners look out for a new pair of
