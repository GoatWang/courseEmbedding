quarter our revenue for the second quarter of  was  million which was in line with our guidance of  million to  million our nongaap loss from continuing operations came in at  per share which was better than our guidance of a  to  loss per share i am pleased with the operational efficiencies we drove in q and roop will discuss this in more details later in the call i will be updating you on our achievements for services and nexus as you know we have been focused on growing and diversifying our services area we are seeing results today we will discuss new wins with staples and original service provider contract extensions with both suddenlink and dish expansion of comcast xfinity home program and becoming the chosen vendor for a major north american service provider we have also made progress with nexus in many areas we have added customers extended the product functionality and grown the pipeline from our direct sales efforts and our channel partners i will give you details on all of these subjects later in the call lets start with our services program i am excited to welcome staples back as a customer of supportcom we have entered a new agreement to provide staples brand at technology support services that will be sold both online and in their stores nationwide our program with staples was launched quickly and already can be found on service part within their stores this is a national program and although the current program is smaller than the work we previously did with staples we are delighted about reestablishing our relationship with this premier brand also during q we competed in a request for proposal process for a service program with a major north american service provider we were selected as their chosen partner in this relationship we will support this partners premium tech support subscribers this program is a kin to our traditional premium tech support programs which tend to carry higher gross margin than our current corporate average we are currently negotiating the final contract terms as we look into  this program will have the potential to be one of our top three services programs and contribute at multimillion dollar level to the topline we also made progress with our existing clients in q suddenlink who became a customer in early  continues to do well in growing their smb subscriber base this offering packages tech support with their broadband services now certainly have signed multiyear contract extension with us continuing our relationship into  the strong partnership with suddenlink position us well for more opportunities with other regional service providers in fact during q we acquired a similar customer to suddenlink a regional service provider in the caribbean who will be bundling tech support services with their higher tier broadband offerings we’re looking forward to supporting another partner as i use this proven successful model of bundling services with product to grow their business and also pleased to report that our agreement with this has been expanded on two fronts first this has extended our agreement for two years in addition this has us to support expansion of their business into the home automation iot market importantly we will use our nexus iot capabilities to deliver this service this is another example of brand name customers are allowing on supportcom for expertise and the emerging market of iot turning to comcast as i mentioned in our q call comcast have been undertaking efforts to improve their customers experience with wireless gateways as a result this is reducing the volume of calls we support as expected during q we began to see the effect of the wireless gateway improvement efforts based on our current understanding we now expect to reduce call volume to continue and you’ll see this reflected in our guidance as for xfinity home program it continues to grow in fact most recently comcast has expanded our service program to include the support of additional internet of things devices and to provide consulting services to help graph this broader programming our support of activities within iot whether for comcast or other customers again reinforces our leadership in the iot area our relationship with comcast which is in it’s this year now strong we continue to perform at or above the key metrics by which comcast hold this accountable including achieving top mark for their voice of the customer metric looking ahead to q  and fiscal year  we expect comcast to remain our largest services customer i’m proud of my teams q performance we manage the changes in the comcast wireless gateway program and improve q services margins at the same time we may progress on diversifying our services customer base both by adding new customer logo and by expanding the nature of our services within our existing customer based during q we also may good progress with our saas offerings nexus we advance in many areas including increased adoption of the products by our current customers the acquisition of new customers increased to market reach the release of additional functionality in the product and further development of nexus strategic initiatives nexus customers continue grow active users increased by  average number of week recession another important metric grew at close to  which shows that overtime customers acquiring increased value from nexus as i mentioned on previous call tracking customer usage is important and engage of realize value and product sickness seen our customers use to products more and more reinforces our belief the nexus is delivering value in the market our gotomarket effort has expanded in addition to our direct sales channel we also have a productive partner program for nexus within the partner program the referral channel has produced its first do nexus customers and there are more nexus prospects and the pipeline as a result of referral we also seeing continue demand from companies who want to become nexus referral partners with our latest referral partner being lean and dl a consultancy for mobile virtual network operators as you may remember from the last earnings call we see the needs of the mobile virtual network operators has been particularly well met by the capabilities of nexus and the mvno market as a sizable and growing market opportunity in q we further extended nexus capabilities with the release of our software development kit or sdk the sdk provides the ability to incorporate nexus capabilities natively into mobile apps with the sdk its easy to embed nexus help into an app allowing users to push one button and get directly to an agent or in the near future help themselves by running selected guided tabs the sdk will be particularly important for our continued growth in the iot market since almost all iot platforms are controlled by a mobile app for example one customer who supports mobile devices has their own app residing on the mobile device which allows their end users to perform selfdiagnosis before engaging with the live agent before using nexus if a user needed help they have to enter in our actions within the app and engage with the agent via telephone call thus disrupting the users experience now with the nexus sdk the user is provided with contextual support where they are at the moment in the app and it creates continuity between the activity history of the user in the app and the information the agent has presented when they answer the request for support assistance is now given to the user wherever they are in the product journey which is a different and necessary evolution of the old support mindset its great to see nexus in the forefront of this evolution finally i would like to talk briefly about our plans for expanding nexus into the self service support market due to the changing dynamics of the support market self service capabilities are important for any well rounded support offering demand for self service is growing rapidly as shown by indiscernible research reporting that all types of selfservice have increased substantially from  to  while phone interactions have remained stagnant almost half of the  billion support interaction optimization market is attributable to customer selfservice the nexus solution for customer selfservice takes the core value of the product guided paths which embody the best agent troubleshooting expertise and puts them directly in the hands of the end user were also building the capability into our selfservice to escalate to an agent if you get stuck on a step in the guided paths when the agent engages to offer help they would know exactly where the user got into trouble and what else theyve tried to resolve their issue we feel that both the expert help available through guided paths and the ability to have an agent assisted selfservice experience will further differentiate nexus in the market customers and prospects are telling us that these capabilities have the potential to break through the chronic problems of low customer satisfaction and poor issue resolution that have dogged the success of self service offerings look for the release of nexus self service capabilities by the end of the year as you remember from q our goal is to exit the year with nexus annual recurring revenue of at least  million and between  and  agent licenses our teams have been laser focused and working hard towards these objectives with the progress we were making on all nexus fronts we remain committed and optimistic that we will meet our year end goals for nexus turning to the team we have in place we recently announced the addition of alex poulos as vice president of marketing alex brings a  year pedigree as a marketing and business leader with the particular focus on saas we also welcome our new vice president and general counsel michelle johnson a  year veteran of inhouse silicon valley legal positions most recently as managing counsel at oracle for the last seven years both alex and michelle bring unique skills to the team and i know they will have an immediate impact and as you may have seen our long serving senior vice president and general counsel greg wrenn will be leaving supportcom these are scintillating introductions to our earnings call which i know you will all miss greg have made enumerable contributions to our company and it is with great sadness that we will say goodbye greg is relocating with a family to seattle washington for personal family reasons and will be returning to private path practice before i close i would like to remind you that we will be hosting an investor day in redwood city california on thursday september  during that day you’ll be able to meet our senior executive team as well as hear directly from our customers and our partners we will go into more depth on our services area and on nexus including showcasing its features and functionality via product demos i look forward to seeing many of you in person out here on the west coast or via webcast for those you that cannot make it in person q was a dynamic quarter with some big news on new services programs and good progress on nexus we would now like to discuss our financials and for that let me turn the call over to roop roop kalyan lakkaraju thanks elizabeth total revenue for q was  million compared to  million in q  and  million in q  services revenue for the quarter was  million compared to  million in q of  and  million in q of  services revenue increased yearoveryear due to higher revenue from comcast primarily driven by the growth in xfinity home program the sequential decrease from q  is primarily due to the traditional seasonality with office depot and the impact of comcast wireless gateway customer experience improvement efforts which as expected reduced our productive hours software and other revenue was  million in q   million in q  and  million in q  the q  revenue mix was  services and  software which is fairly consistent with q  of  services and  software and q  of  services and  software in q both comcast and office depot contributed more than  of total revenue overall nongaap gross margin for q was  compared to  in q  and  in q  in q nongaap services gross margin was  compared to  in q  and  in q  the sequential improvement from q  to q  is primarily due to increased productivity in our contact center operations from comcast xfinity home and wireless gateway programs nongaap software gross margin was  in q   in q  and  in q  total nongaap operating expenses in q  came in at  million an increase from  million in q  and  million in q  the yearoveryear and sequential increase is the result of our previously stated plans to make incremental investment in gotomarket capabilities and in nexus development on a nongaap basis loss from continuing operations for q was  million or  per share this was  better than our nongaap eps guidance range of a loss of  to  due to the increased productivity in our contact center operations and prudent management of our operating expenses even while investing in gotomarket capabilities and in nexus product development on a gaap basis loss from continuing operations includes a onetime noncash goodwill impairment charge of  million and an associated tax benefit of  million during q we identified a goodwill impairment charge based on various qualitative factors which included among others the continuing decline in the companys market capitalization resulting in an excess the book value of the companys net assets compared to the estimated value of these as of june   this was a noncash charge that does not affect our revenue cash flow or business operations we do not anticipate incurring meaningful federal or state income taxes for the foreseeable future as a result of our net operating loss carry forwards however to the extent that we have future taxable income the company will be subject to alternative minimum taxes in certain tax paying jurisdictions turning now to the balance sheet total cash cash equivalents and investments were  million at june   compared to  million at march   dsos for the quarter were  days as compared to  days in the prior quarter at june  less than  of our outstanding receivables were greater than  days old deferred revenue was  million at june  compared to  million at march  total headcount at june   was  consisting of  corporate employees and  work from home technicians this compares to the march  headcount of  consisting of  corporate employees and  work from home technicians in addition to our work from home technicians we use contract labor in our operations turning to guidance for the third quarter of  we expect our revenue range to be between  million to  million our guidance reflects the anticipated impact of customer experience improvement efforts within the wireless gateway program for q we expect that revenue mix of  services and  software we expect the overall nongaap gross margin to be in the low s as a result of investing in new program launches that will be occurring in the second half of  as you recall when launching new services programs we typically invest ahead of revenue therefore we will be investing throughout q and in q and we expect to see revenue from these new programs starting later in q we expect our nongaap software gross margin to be approximately  and nongaap operating expenses to increase sequentially by approximately  to  as we continue to invest in gotomarket capabilities and in nexus development based on the foregoing our outlook for q nongaap results from continuing operations is a loss of  per share to  per share its important to note that our services and end user software areas provide positive gross profit dollars these positive gross profit dollars are being invested in our gotomarket initiatives and in our nexus product development as weve previously discussed our quarterly nongaap results are generally indicative of a cash usage or cash generation excluding capital expenditures which have not been significant historically however during q we do expect to incur between  million to  million of nonrecurring capital expenditures related to certain leasehold improvements and data center equipment purchases in summary q saw solid execution within our contact center operations we continue to see our end user software deliver strong margins that deliver positive cash flow and we saw nexus gaining momentum all are maintaining a healthy cash balance which is necessary as we continue to execute on our strategy with that id like to turn the call back to elizabeth elizabeth cholawsky in ending this call i would like to leave you with some food for thought weve all seen in the past month that supportcom has been ascribed a very low enterprise value with our stock trading at or just above cash we believe that the market is not properly valuing our our company and its assets our fundamental business is sound with profitable name brand services programs and many other assets that roop has mentioned weve progressed on the goals that ive discussed with you over the last five quarters including service program diversification creation of a product company and growth of the saas offering we have a bright future as a premier saas and services company in the growing support market as were able to better educate our constituents about these facts and our vision and execute on our plans i believe that we will all be appropriately rewarded now ill turn the call over to the operator for your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of chad bennett of craig hallum your line is open chad bennett so just on comcast can you give us a sense or as a percentage of revenue where they are today obviously you gave q guidance so i guess we only have one quarter left in the year but where you would think they would exit the year and whether or not you think comcast revenue is still a headwind into  roop kalyan lakkaraju yes so you had a number of different things in there chad that i trying and hit them one by one in terms of comcast we see them continuing to make positive strides on their customer experience improvement efforts and obviously thats reflected in our q guidance here we do believe as we look forward even with those continuing efforts and the traction that theyre gaining there that they will be our largest customer in q and into  its hard for us to predict exactly where theyre going to land we still get the forecast and that we manage the program by but were trying to give as much understanding as we have based on our conversations with them and as they continue to make strides in their efforts chad bennett so on the new partners or the expanded relationships that you announced for example staples i know staples has been around for a long time its never really taken off whats kind of changed with this program and what  i guess the main question is are the efforts were putting in to expanded partnerships and new partnerships on the services side of the business ever going to actually  i mean none of these relationships  so are they ever going to turn into real partner programs roop kalyan lakkaraju yes so maybe just to start  i will start and elizabeth you jump in please staples chad was a  customer in past year as i think in   even  where they were a  customer we cant say that theyre going to be a  customer now however what we are very happy with is the fact that theyve reengaged with us even though this initial program maybe small and we think that that  we continue to talk to them about other potential opportunities and we also think that thats a favorable thing as it relates to the office depot side of things and any potential transaction that may or may not occur there with all that said and as weve indicated in our prepared remarks even though were still in negotiations with the service provider that we mentioned in our comments we did also mention that we do anticipate or believe that they can be a topthree customer as we move forward with all that said it does take time for the subscription type programs to ramp and as weve indicated were investing for those ramps here in the second half of this year and well see that gain towards full ramp into  elizabeth elizabeth cholawsky that was great that was great roop operator our next question comes from the line of mike latimore of northland capital markets your line is open jim fitzgerald this is jim fitzgerald standing for mike latimore so it sounds like the new saas initiative is ramping pretty well how do you guys use a personnel you have there do you feel like you have any other key hires you have to make or you guys are pretty set as far as personnel elizabeth cholawsky yes i have been building out the team since i got here little over a year ago now and i feel like we’ve got a really strong bench because i’ve really focused on adding executives that have knowledge in the product space and can really execute with the strategy that we’ve got and as you heard on our call we just added our new vp of marketing alex poulos and we also have michelle johnson who has joined us as vice president and general council so i think that pretty rounds out the executive team for the time being and i think we are good to go jim fitzgerald okay great and then you guys might have might have mentioned this on comment but when wil that new staples service start and is that across all stores and then certainly kind of a third part so its kind of a long question but is the pricing similar in the staple service as what we see in other retail situations other retail customers roop kalyan lakkaraju yes i think the pricing you can say its similar to other retail situation it is a national program and we’ve had a small part of it actually launched already here in the third quarter and the other aspects that will launch here in very near term jim fitzgerald and do you guys have any essence of the call volume and the agents that maybe needed to support that relationship roop kalyan lakkaraju we are still working through exactly what that volume maybe its a subscription in incident based type of program similar to other premium tech support programs we’ve had historically and similar to what we’ve had with them previously specifically so its hard to say we’re still kind of doing that business planning and then trying to understand what that looks like as we move forward which is part of the investments we’re making jim fitzgerald great and then last question from me what appear to be the best channels so far for nexus elizabeth cholawsky yes first and foremost that channel is the direct sales channel and i think thats true of any new product to the market as you need all that knowledge coming back directly into the product development and product management team so we get that going on and i think mentioned last call or the call before that we focused in the first half for the year building up that team so we’ve got that up and running and certainly thats the one thats most productive if i look at the alliance and partnership program thats a little earlier on than our direct channel but i’m pleased thats so quickly really i think we announced that in february march of this year and very quickly we’ve got partners that have joined the program that are starting to actually give us new customers for nexus so that one will take a longer time to ramp up but generally a channel partner for saas product there for a couple of years becomes more and more important which is why i wanted to started early operator our next question comes from the line of nick farewell with arbor group your line is open nick farewell i just wanted to followup on your cash flow comments or at least in your initial projections for the third quarter i want to make sure that i understand them correctly if i look at first and second quarter you basically burned  million if i did it correctly from operations going into the third quarter i believe if i have done my math correctly you are talking about roughly losing about  million on an operating basis based on your guidance and spending another  to  million on capex am i accurate in that interpretation roop kalyan lakkaraju yes nick this is roop its good to hear from you yes i think the way you’ve just summarized that its the right way to put it together and just remember our guidance range  to  so just doing it approximately  million shares you can kind of do the math there yes just little more than  million to  call it more like   million if you look from a nongaap perspective but otherwise its headon nick farewell so something like a burn of  million and again i’m not holding to the number i’m looking at is an approximate placeholder roop kalyan lakkaraju thats right and again yes  to  of it is associate with nonrecurring capital expenditures for expansion equipment refresh for our data center operations and then some leasehold improvements that we needed to do for regulatory nick farewell right and thats the having had the opportunity visit the redwood city facility im curious does that suggest even though your headcount is up slightly with corporate that youre going to have additional headcount that you need to support and youre expanding your footprint or just building it out roop kalyan lakkaraju i don’t think you should read into anything other than our office is here are updated and there is some refresh that we need to do and just general aesthetics to make for a good environment especially here in the valley nick farewell so if you take the third quarter guidance can you provide us some sense of what the fourth quarter burn rate wouldve might approximately roop kalyan lakkaraju its really hard at this point in time thats why we only gave one quarter guidance and as weve always done that and part of it is due to some of the churns in comcast and that the forecast that we received which are short in nature so it really is hard to try and provide an extrapolation into the fourth quarter of what does guidance look like or what does revenue look like these sort of things nick farewell let me ask maybe slightly differently then if you look at over the next year and for planning purposes presumably you at least try to understand what  might look like with the whole company and specifically comcast is there a natter in your outlook through  or  with respect to your comcast absolute numbers not relative roop kalyan lakkaraju in our prepared remarks weve indicated that we expect or believe that comcast will continue to be our largest customer and i think thats probably one aspect to hang your hat on and then of course weve got some new programs that would be ramping here in the second half of the year and we continue to have a good pipeline of new prospects or potential prospects on services and obviously the nexus side of the business as well and so all of those will contribute towards the financial makeup of  and the other thing to remind everyone is these new services programs do have gross margins that are above our corporate average and i think about it as kind of north of  points thats what were targeting which overtime along with nexus and yet having saas margins will start to allow our gross margins to climb as we move forward nick farewell thank you and just one additional question when i look at the first and second quarter services volume going from  to in essence  or declining  million sequentially and your gross profit was the same obviously suggesting enhanced gross profit margins can you  what accounts for that is it purely productivity is it mix what are the factors and to what degree its estimated roop kalyan lakkaraju as a matter of fact theres mix in there and remember in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter weve indicated that we were investing in xfinity home ramps and these sorts of things weve now seen some of that ramp as weve commented in our discussion here today so weve got higher productivity as well as the mix aspect so both of those contribute to the overall margin profile from a quartertoquarter perspective nick farewell would you expect that to continue at least going into the third quarter roop kalyan lakkaraju well we continuously strive and drive towards operational efficiencies i think we purposefully called out with these new wins that we have investments that well need to make ahead of revenue and so they will put some downward pressure on our margins as historically has been the case when were ramping especially subscription or incident based programs or premium technical support type programs and thats the case here for the second half of the year nick farewell so that means instead of the second quarters  it may be closer to first quarter  just as a rough approximation roop kalyan lakkaraju yes weve given the guidance right margin profile if you will and i think that thats a good way to think about our profile for q operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of kyle packer ph private investor your line is open kyle packer you guys talked during the phone mainly about the market under valuating the enterprise and what conversation you guys have had internally about redeploying excess capital roop kalyan lakkaraju i mean it something that on a regular basis the management team and the board evaluate in terms of the best use of our capital and cash in particular obviously as you can see and as we’ve commented on we continue to invest both in services as well as nexus and we believe that nexus has place in the marketplace and solves some business need or addresses some business need and we feel along with the board that the best use of capital is to invest that back into the business and the company overall and that’s what we’re doing kyle packer even with aggressive what i would say will be aggressive deployment plans for capital you still have what appear to be a lot of excess roop kalyan lakkaraju i guess it’s a judgment call and again as we invest and we’re in a nascent time with nexus it’s just launched really in the fourth quarter of  we’ve got product development efforts that we are working through and gotomarket capabilities that are being built and the other aspect is that we have indicated that when opportunities arise related to acquisitions that we want to be in a position to take advantage of that and technology companies many times utilize acquisitions to help support product development and as well as expansion in market places operator our next question comes from the line of arthur winston of pilot advisors your line is open arthur winston it seems like your major program comcast will be down approximately  million or so in this current third quarter i’m wondering what part of your comcast business is not this program and what part of the comcast business is what we’re losing out on roop kalyan lakkaraju we’ve got two primary programs with comcast it’s a wireless gateway and the xfinity home we don’t breakout specifically on a programbyprogram level what we have indicated is that the wireless gateway is the larger program then xfinity home however as indicated by our ks within the quarter and even in prior quarter we have some expansion with xfinity home which we’re very happy with and i think speaks to the strength of our overall comcast relationship and especially our relationships with the xfinity home business unit with all that said the customer experience improvement efforts of comcast are across their entire business if you will and we follow them for their efforts around that and with all that said we’re focused on execution with them and we are one of their top vendors from an operational metric standpoint and as indicated in our prepared remarks we received the highest marks for the voice of customer metric so we’ve got a very strong relationship with comcast overall arthur winston could you give some idea what your revenue growth was either in the second quarter or will be in third quarter excluding this one program in other words if youve never heard to this one program would your revenues be growing roop kalyan lakkaraju i mean again we don’t provide forwardlooking guidance on customer concentration i’m sorry arthur winston take the second quarter without any forwardlooking guidance roop kalyan lakkaraju as it relates to noncomcast revenue and did it grow arthur winston not in the one program the good part of the comcast plus everything else roop kalyan lakkaraju the good part of a comcast i mean comcast overall i’m sorry maybe i misunderstanding your question arthur winston well these two programs there one is being cut back and right we saw and the rest of the comcast is allegedly increasing correct roop kalyan lakkaraju yes arthur winston so if you had that one  if you get the one program are we growing roop kalyan lakkaraju again we’re not going to breakout programbyprogram arthur winston at the end of the year you got to break it out you have no choice roop kalyan lakkaraju actually what we’re required to do is provide those greater than  which we do disclose which is office depot and comcast beyond that we haven’t historically talked about it on a programbyprogram level and at this point in time we do not intend to do so either arthur winston is the company growing roop kalyan lakkaraju i mean we have nexus that is growing right arthur winston right roop kalyan lakkaraju we have new programs that we have just won that will be ramping so we have new services areas that are coming online in the second half as we have indicated in our prepared remarks operator our next question comes from line of steve barger private investor your line is open q  steve barger hi thanks for taking my question i guess just going back to that comment about the market undervaluing the business just broadly speaking do you think its undervalued because you have clear line of sight on the investments you are making and generating higher revenue you think the trends in the base business lead you to see a return to positive cash flow generation where is the disconnect elizabeth cholawsky so heres how i look at it so the big dynamic that was talked about  or a dynamic over the last two quarters has been whats happening with wireless gateway but if you look at what we measure kind of a growth in longterm goodness of the company on there is a lot of progress we have made and i talked about it in the call today on top of that our initiatives both diversification of the programs and the growing new premium technology support programs as well as nexus have a higher margin than what we are seeing for the last couple of three or four quarters at supportcom so if you put all those things together and you look at the trajectory for the execution of our strategy in the medium to longer term and you have got a business that is very well positioned to be a premier service in saas business so i look at all that and then i look as being value of the cash and i do think there is a disconnect as i said as we go out and educate more and really talk about this more and can talk about more of the diversification i am helping with that education in the market and executing quarteroverquarter will change how we are being valued steve barger understood and i hear what you are saying about wanting to invest in the business first with the cash but if the management team you have in place and the operational initiatives you have undertaken truly mark an operational bottom there will never be a better time to buy the stock and if you really want to reward shareholders that might be an excellent way just to use a part of that cash balance to really help out the people whove been with you for a long period of time elizabeth cholawsky we have talked i think earlier on this call a little bit about what our feeling is and our current point of view on cash usage and what the best use of cash is right now so we continue to evaluate that but for right now the consensus of the executive team with the board is that is investing in the strategy and investing in our business is going to give the return to our shareholders operator i am showing no further questions in the queue i would like to turn the call back over to elizabeth cholawsky ceo for any further remarks elizabeth cholawsky thanks everyone for the time you took today to listen to the call and i hope to see many of you in september at indiscernible city bye for today operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in todays
