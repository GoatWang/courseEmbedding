close collapse download expand facebook googleplus hamburger linkedin more notice portfolio print resizetext rss save search twitter youtube by chris mayer posted march   secretive family solid investment it’s one of the largest familycontrolled banks in the us i am sure this small fact had a lot to do with it skating through the banking crisis without any trouble or need for a government handout not only that but it actually took advantage of the crisis by picking up busted banks while the government paid it to do sointriguedwhat follows is the remarkable story of this secretive bank management holds no conference calls it doesn’t do corporate presentations what it does do is run a good bank and not take any big risks management just keeps piling up value per share year after yearfirst citizens bancshares symbol fcnca price  based in raleigh nc is that bank it has  branches mostly in north carolina and virginia but also in  other states including washington dc the bank has roots to  robert p holding gained control in the s ever since he and his descendants have run the show as the k reportsour chairman of the board and chief executive officer frank b holding jr is the grandson of robert p holding hope h connell the vice chairman of bancshares and fcb is robert p holding’s granddaughter frank b holding son of robert p holding and father of frank b holding jr and hope h connell is our executive vice chairman carmen holding ames a granddaughter of robert p holding is a member of our board of directorsas i say first citizens is a family affair know that you are a junior partner in the deal the holding family owns  of the a shares and  of the b shares which have superior voting rights altogether they own  of the company and  of the voting rights…and they have been good stewards so farthey pay themselves reasonably total cash compensation for these key executives is well below peer group compensation they’ll make most of their money through stock appreciation and dividends just like their shareholdersnow let me get to another aspect of fc that i like it has acquired busted banks in socalled fdicassisted transactions in short fc takes over a “bad” bank for which liabilities exceed assets the fdic makes up the difference by writing fc a check the fdic also typically covers  of any losses fc may incur with the acquired assets this is why people say you don’t buy a failed bank with an fdicassisted transaction so much as you get paid to take it the fdic just wants depositors’ money to be safe so if it can move the deposits to a safer bank mission accomplishedfc has acquired six banks with fdic assistance beginning in  and has booked almost  million in gains clearly these fdicassisted takeovers can be pretty sweet dealsas american banker opinedwhen the history of the current financial crisis is written it will be replete with stories of savvy investors who bought failed banks’ assets from the fdic for pennies on the dollar and recovered not just dimes but quarters or betteragreed this is not the first time fc has taken advantage of a crisis it bought six failed banks between  and  during the sl crisis i love this part of fc’s story and it fits with one of my bedrock investment strategies take advantage of a crisisfc has quietly put together a good steady record no wall street analysts cover the stock in fact nobody covers the stock as far as i know except starting now me and the stock has seldom been cheaper the nearby chart shows the opportunity most clearly it’s a great chart as it gives you pretty much a full cyclethe line moving steadily upward from left to right is tangible book value per share this is the key number on which the market values banks — shorthand for net asset value you can see that over the last  years fc has more than doubled its value per shareyet look at the other line declining from left to right that is the pricetotangible book ratio you can buy a dollar of tangible book value for about  cents today the only time it was cheaper was for a brief couple of months in early  the market hit bottom in march of that yearfc has grown that tangible book about  annually during the last decade that kind of growth helped make fc one of snl’s tangible book value winners snl is a research firm and ranks all banks by tangible book value growth over preceding  months fc ranked fifth at  for the  months ending june  snl has found such stocks outperform peers and the sp  indexcontinued growth of that kind is not a given of course fc faces the problems all banks face higher regulatory costs and net interest margin pressures fc’s core earnings will be affected negatively also gains booked from past acquisitions are not easily repeatable still i think banks will find new ways to make money and cut costs and fc’s competitive position and size will make it one of the winnersbut banks stocks are down and unpopular at the moment but when the cycle turns as it inevitably always does banks will again command premiums over book value then the market will value such stocks at  or  times book when that happens the returns for fc can get exciting let’s say the bank continues to grow at  annually over the next ten years assuming  pricetobook multiple at the end of that time the stock would more than triple to  per share — that would be a return of almost  annually not including the dividendbottom line buying low really mattersregardschris mayer for the daily reckoning the daily reckoning you may also be interested in gold’s seasonality time to get
