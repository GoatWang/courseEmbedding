brings sustainable innovative company to north america  luther graduate michael walters brings sustainable innovative company to north america search october   oct   in may  luther college alumnus michael walters whitelines director of business development in north america celebrated the north american launch of whitelines a swedish company providing innovative paper products while remaining dedicated to protecting the environment walters a  luther graduate first encountered whitelines while working within his company studio where walters partners with other businesses to direct their overall market strategy bridging the gap between their products and large retail environments while working on a joint venture with office depot in  walters came across a whitelines booth while attending a convention in germany one month later walters visited whitelines in sweden and established the partnership for business development in north america whitelines based in stockholm sweden was founded by three creativity and innovation consultants working with mental tools and training such as lateral thinking and triz a theory of inventive problem solving “although these studies are rare in american universities tim schweizer luther professor of management is an expert in this field” said walters “he was my mentor while attending luther” using these tools the founders of whitelines designed paper products that eliminate the visual conflict between traditional dark lines and writing on a page by printing white lines on a light gray paper whitelines products allow the dark lines of writing and sketches to stand out against the light elements of the page this innovation has been shown to help people with learning disabilities such as autism dyslexia and eye stigmatism by removing the eye fatigue visual stress and distractions that occur when dark ink conflicts with dark lines on a page “this is a very important aspect of whitelines” said walters “yes whitelines is innovative and a healthy option for our planet but is also serves a very important purpose” whitelines is able to serve that purpose while working toward the goal of becoming carbon neutral by producing zero carbon footprint in a joint effort with stockholm’s royal institute of technology and paper producer storaenso whitelines’ nymolla mill in southern sweden operates with ultramodern paper technology that reuses the carbon dioxide in a closedloop system emitting no carbon dioxide from the plant whitelines also focuses on preventing carbon dioxide emissions rather than compensating for them by maintaining short transports to warehouses shipping large batches overseas by boat and by locally producing and assembling the paper products to show their low environmental impact whitelines is one of the first companies to place exact individual carbon dioxide footprint labels on all of their products showing the impact of each product on the environment in  whitelines will start to offset the low yet remaining carbon dioxide emissions by planting trees in uganda a process handled by uw a “change to green” consultancy with a year track record walters stated “ i hope the partnership between sweden and studio can serve as a model for other businesses to not only help our economy by creating new innovations but finding ways for us all to better our planet” for more

dejonge aids understanding of bonhoeffers thought by analysing the lutheran character of his thinking sheds light on bonhoeffers thinking lends it coherence and makes sense of otherwise difficult interpretive problems advances the hermeneutical argument not only through exegesis but through the criticism of the exegesis of others provides a historical and comparative analysis of this topic bonhoeffers reception of luther michael p dejonge description in dietrich bonhoeffers writings martin luther is ubiquitous too often however bonhoeffers lutheranism has been set aside with much less argumentative work than is appropriate in light of his sustained engagement with luther as a result luther remains a largely untouched hermeneutic key in bonhoeffer interpretation in bonhoeffers reception of luther michael p dejonge presents bonhoeffers lutheran theology of justification focused on the interpersonal presence of christ in word sacrament and church the bridge between this theology and bonhoeffers ethicalpolitical reflections is his twokingdoms thinking arguing that the widespread failure to connect bonhoeffer with the lutheran twokingdoms tradition has presented a serious obstacle in interpretation dejonge shows how this tradition informs bonhoeffers reflections on war and peace as well as his understanding of resistance to political authority in all of this dejonge argues that an appreciation of luthers ubiquity in bonhoeffers corpus sheds light on his thinking lends it coherence and makes sense of otherwise difficult interpretive problems what might otherwise appear as disparate even contradictory moments or themes in bonhoeffers theology can often be read in terms of a consistent commitment to a basic lutheran theological framework deployed according to dramatically changing circumstances show more bonhoeffers reception of luther michael p dejonge table of contents list of abbreviationsintroduction an argument for bonhoeffer interpretation on the way toward christocentrism christology in conversation with barth and the lutheran tradition caricatures of the two kingdoms the twofold form of christ bonhoeffers twokingdoms thinking anabaptists and peace lutheran resistance resources struggle and resistancebibliography bonhoeffers reception of luther michael p dejonge author information michael p dejonge is associate professor of religious studies at the university of south florida where he teaches on the history of christian theology and topics in modern religious thought his previous publications include bonhoeffers theological formation  and the bonhoeffer reader coedited with clifford j green  bonhoeffers reception of luther michael p dejonge reviews and awards students will benefit greatly from dejonges investigations of sanctorum communio act and being as well as of the cost of discipleship  most exciting is the appreciation of bonhoeffers concept of revelation of the church as christus praesens in the world here and now this takes the catholic doctrine of the church as the body of christ to new dimensions as the various works of the german roman catholic theologian ernst feil  have attested for example his the theology of dietrich bonhoeffer  dejonges recent contribution is a further welcome enrichment of bonhoeffer literaturejournal of religious history this work will be essential for anyone interested in the development of bonhoeffers theology michael dejonge writes with remarkable clarity about some of the more complex and contested aspects of bonhoeffers thought offering provocative new insights into bonhoeffers approach to the two kingdoms christian pacifism and the challenges of resistance without ignoring the other theological influences on bonhoeffers thought this book makes a convincing case that to understand bonhoeffer we must examine his reading and interpretation of luthervictoria j barnett general editor dietrich bonhoeffer works english edition in this new work rising star michael dejonge executes a lucid patient and in the end devastating critique of north american readings of dietrich bonhoeffers theological legacy that alone is worth the price of admission even better is the extraordinary retrieval he makes of bonhoeffers core lutheranism dejonge understands luther better than many a lutheran and bonhoeffer better than any other north american interpreter tolle legepaul r hinlicky tise professor of lutheran studies univerzita komenskeho slovakia dejonges meticulouslyresearched contextuallygrounded analysis of bonhoeffers frequent appropriate of luthers thought and specific lutheran elements of his application of the biblical message to the midtwentieth century world combines with the authors critical engagement with scholars who have minimized and misinterpreted bonhoeffers deep immersion in the reformers theology dejonge confirms the estimation of bonhoeffers own associates who recognized their friends appreciation of and reliance on luthers thought in a clearlystated convincing argument this volume offers sharper and deeper insights into bonhoeffers ever more relevant assessment of the christian gospel the church and society and thus it points bonhoeffer studies in new exciting directionsrobert kolb emeritus professor of systematic theology concordia seminary saint louis share also
