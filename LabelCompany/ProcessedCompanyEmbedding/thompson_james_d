and when to remove this template message james david thompson january   in indianapolis – september   was an american sociologist in  thompsons family moved to chicago where he went to a public high school he graduated from indiana university with a ba in business and served in the united states air force from  to  he obtained a masters degree in journalism and worked half a year as an editor for the chicago journal of commerce before taking a position as a journalism teacher at the university of wisconsin from  to  he worked on his final degree a phd in sociology from the university of north carolina at chapel hill from there he moved to cornell university to teach at the school of business and public administration he helped found the administrative science quarterly of which he was the first editor in  he became the director of the administrative science center at the university of pittsburgh in  he published organizations in action social science bases of administrative theory one of the most influential books on organizations thompson moved one last time in  to teach at the department of sociology at vanderbilt university he was diagnosed with cancer in  and died september   james d thompsons typology of decision making where both preferences and causeeffect relations are clear decision making is computational these decisions are often short term and information about the decision is fairly unambiguous where outcome preferences are clear but causeeffect relations are uncertain thompson suggest that judgment takes over and you make your best educated guess these decisions are based on prior experience and are often qualitative in nature when the situation is reversed and preferences are uncertain then you rely on compromise between different groups political coalitions may be built which rely on negotiating and bargaining when neither preferences nor causeeffect relations are clear then you rely on inspirational leadership this is where the charismatic leader may step in and this type of decision often takes place in times of crisis organizations in actionedit organizations in action was published in  the book is still today a classic multidisciplinary study of the behavior of complex organizations as entities the book considers individuals behavior only in the extent that it helps explain the nature of organizations james d thompson offers 9 distinct propositions about the behavior of organizations all relevant regardless of the culture in which they are found a central topic in the book is that organizations must meet and handle uncertainty he classifies organizations according to their technologies and environments thompson saw technology as a dimension in understanding the actions of complex organization thompson recognized the benefit for managers of using a typology of technology that could be general enough to deal with a different range of technologies found in complex organizations he proposed then three varieties the longlinked technology is a primary process with sequential dependence it is characterized by a high level of closure standardization of operations tools parts and machines the mediating technology the intensive technology a number of theoretical perspectives have developed subsequent to thompsons work most notably organizational ecology and institutional theory referencesedit
