groundbreaking uk academic science into economic and potential therapeutic value and secures significant investment into our technology platform and clinical pipeline well into the future we look forward to working within the group to advance our programmes both partnered and inhouse and over time to providing much needed new treatment options for patients”  strategic rationale the group has been exploring strategic opportunities that can both build on and go beyond the secured revenue stream in milestones and royalties derived from the two copd products ultibro® breezhaler® and seebri® breezhaler® marketed by its partner novartis the acquisition of heptares with its exciting clinical and preclinical pipeline of potentially transformative new medicines targeting serious diseases with major unmet need eg alzheimer’s disease adhd metabolic disease schizophrenia migraine and others and its unique differentiated and high potential star® drug discovery platform significantly fulfils this goal and further represents a major step towards the group’s strategic vision of becoming a significant global biopharmaceutical company arising from japan in addition to its pipeline and platform heptares has established collaborative partnerships with a number of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies that provide the company with a prospective stream of revenue through

that are crucial to communication between cells their central role in many biological processes means that they are important targets for drugs gpcrs are the site of action of about  of currently marketed drugs the potential of the heptares platform for both discovery of novel differentiated small molecules and biologics is therefore very high heptares brings to the group an enhanced product
