components allowing broadcasters to show movies and recorded programs at an accelerated rate without audio distortion programming and advertisements could be made to fit time slots without cutting technicians referred to this process as lexiconning lexicon ceo ron noonan described the technology avoiding the tyranny of scissors the device was also promoted for creative uses such as heightening excitement in a tv program or news broadcast by speeding up time lexicons time compressor model  received an emmy in  from the national academy of television arts and sciences for its technical contributions to editing controversy and creativityedit critics argued that the time compressor technology particularly when applied to movies and older television programs amounted to defacing a creative work analogous to colorization film director elliot silverstein argued that to use these devices before the artist completes his work makes it part of the creative process but once the artist has completed his work to change it without his permission however subtly may prejudice his honor or reputation however some artists took advantage of the creative possibilities stanley kubrick for example used the timecompression device to speed up the sound of guns firing in full metal jacket to intensify the battle scenes american musician and producer chris walla used the early model varispeech to create audio effects such as making everything sound like dr who pat metheny describes using lexicon digital reverb and digital delay technology to create the chorused thing that i guess

loops and recording devices mit lecturer barry blesser suggested they try running audio through lees digital delay apparatus with bagnaschi they created the first digital signal processor steve temmer the president of new york city’s gotham audio heard about the experiment and commissioned  units of what would be sold as the delta t in  introducing digital reverberation and effects processors to the recording industry digital digital timecompression and expansion varispeechedit in  lee filed a patent for a device that could compress or expand the time duration of sound waves while preserving normal sound quality that year lexicon introduced varispeech an electronic speech compressor for use in the language instruction market specifically to help blind students access text more quickly and persons with speech disorders study spoken language varispeech the first commercially available pitch shifter could speed up or slow down recorded speech while maintaining normal pitch audio time compressor and expanderedit an advanced version of varispeech—the time compressor —was introduced in  the device coupled audio timecompression with visual components allowing broadcasters to show movies and recorded programs at an accelerated rate without audio distortion programming and advertisements could be made to fit time slots without cutting technicians referred to this process as lexiconning lexicon ceo ron noonan described the technology avoiding the tyranny of scissors the device was also promoted for creative uses such as heightening excitement in a tv program or news broadcast by speeding up time lexicons time compressor model  received an emmy in  from the national academy of television arts and sciences for its technical contributions to editing controversy and creativityedit critics argued that the time compressor technology particularly when applied to movies and older television programs amounted to defacing a creative work analogous to colorization film director elliot silverstein argued that to use these devices before the artist completes his work makes it part of the creative process but once the artist has completed his work to change it without his permission however subtly may prejudice his honor or reputation however some artists took advantage of the creative possibilities stanley kubrick for example used the timecompression device to speed up the sound of guns firing in full metal jacket to intensify the battle scenes american musician and producer chris walla used the early model varispeech to create audio effects such as making everything sound like dr who pat metheny describes using lexicon digital reverb and digital delay technology to create the chorused thing that i guess i would have to say i was the first to use extensively in jazz and that seemed to have influenced a lot of other guys to do the same selling lexiconedit the company went public in  on the london stock exchange in  lexicon was sold to harman
