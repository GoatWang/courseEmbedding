chet brandenburg chief product officer  cocreator the history of mindbody is very closely tied to the efforts of chet brandenburg a mindbody veteran he joined the company in the summer of  and has spent over a decade bringing new innovations to our software like many in senior management chet began in tech support back when there were only a handful of employees learning the ins and outs of the software and fielding calls from clients in need of assistance that experience compelled chet to think big to imagine what mindbody could be and it still informs his decisions today the defining project for chet—and really for mindbody—was his work on the web scheduler which was the first in the industry to allow clients to sync online bookings with their installed desktop studio management software its instant success quickly led to a realization why not bring all of mindbody’s capabilities online chet was the one to bring that idea to life and it earned him the distinction of cocreator he has been at the helm of the software’s continuous evolution ever since for chet exceptionally designed software walks the line between two equally important ideals—both naturally emerging from the fact that the user’s experience is the single most important factor on one hand we strive to be almost entirely transparent a product that seamlessly assimilates into the client’s daily life as a business owner at the same time we strive to be a powerful addition to any business providing capabilities that the same business owner never even imagined possible chet holds a bachelor of science in
