trialsongoing trialsatiati is cytori’s lead nanomedicine product a generic liposomal formulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride  liposomal doxorubicin has been approved by the fda and the european

showing “bioequivalence” which means that the drug levels in the blood and tissue following injection of ati must be equivalent using fdaemaspecified bioequivalence criteria to the levels seen when

bioequivalence of ati and the reference listed drug in europe  caelyx® has already been demonstrated in a clinical trial cytori is now preparing for submission for approval by the ema if granted this

company was created as the result of a  merger between macropore biosurgery inc founded in  and stemsource inc founded in  the joint company operated under the macropore name until  when it changed its name to cytori therapeutics cytori is headquartered in san diego ca and also has operations in japan and the united kingdom core technology the celution systemedit cytori develops cellular therapeutics formulated for specific diseases and medical conditions clinical development programs are currently targeting impaired hand function in scleroderma phase iii clinical osteoarthritis of the knee phase ii clinical and thermal burn injury preclinical phase cytori’s cellular therapeutics are collectively known as cytori cell therapytm and consist of different formulations of a heterogeneous population of cells including stem cells that are involved in response to injury repair and healing this cell therapy product is prepared from a patient’s own adipose fat tissue using the company’s fully automated celution® system that disaggregates adipose tissue and liberates the entrapped stem and regenerative cells that naturally reside in native adipose the system formulates a cell therapy product that is available for delivery to the patient within – hours of tissue collection cytori’s lead indication is currently in a us phase iii fda approved pivotal study the star trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct designed to evaluate one administration of cytori’s eccs in treating impaired hand and finger function from scleroderma the star trial initiated june  completed enrollment of  patients in june  and cytori anticipates follow up data to be available mid the company has also recently completed a us fda approved phase ii study actoa trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct to examine ecco safety feasibility and dosing in the treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee preliminary data was released q  cosmetic and reconstructive surgeryedit the celution system was introduced into the european and asiapacific cosmetic and reconstructive surgery market in  since that time physicians in europe and japan have been using adrcs to enrich fat grafts for a number of cosmetic applications including breast reconstruction breast augmentation facial rejuvenation and buttock augmentation among others restore iedit restore i was an independent japanese study that examined reconstruction of partial mastectomy breast defects using adrcs isolated using the celution system the  patient study was found to be safe and well tolerated in all patients the study showed a high  level of patient satisfaction with the final outcome restore edit following the promising results of restore i cytori launched its own european breast reconstruction postmarketing study named restore  in june  the  patient study was designed to assess patient and physician satisfaction improvement in overall breast deformity imaging quality of life and safety among other measures the study completed enrollment in november  with all patients to be followed up at both six and  months six month interim results on  patients were presented at the nd annual san antonio breast cancer symposium on december   in addition to reinforcing the safety of the procedure the restore  study showed that  of patients and  of physicians were satisfied with the outcome of the procedure fat graftingedit in addition to celution cytori developed the puregraft system which allows the physician to wash and purify the fat tissue before reinjection into the same patient standardizing the fat graft preparation process cytori received a k for market clearance of the puregraft system in january  for use in aesthetic body contouring using autologous fat grafts in addition to the puregraft system cytori has developed the celbrush a precision fat graft delivery tool cardiovascular diseaseedit cytori is sponsoring two european safety and feasibility studies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease using adrcs extracted using the celution system apolloedit cytori’s apollo study was designed to evaluate the use of adrcs in the treatment of patients who have undergone myocardial infarctions in march  the study’s steering committee and the data safety and monitoring board dsmb deemed that the safety and feasibility goals of the study had been met after the enrollment of  patients primary outcomes for the study will be assessed at the six month follow up the adrc therapy resulted in a reduction in infarct size by  and significant improvement of lv perfusion mibi spect and an improvement of left ventricular function by  at  month followup at  months fu the improvement on infarct size persisted as well as the effect lv function a progressive improvement of cardiac remodelling was noted preciseedit cytori’s precise study evaluates the use of adrcs to treat patients suffering from chronic myocardial ischemia enrollment in the trial was completed in may  with the enrollment of  patients primary outcomes of the study will be assessed at six months stemsource and stem cell bankingedit cytori has also developed stemsource automated laboratory equipment for tissue processing and cell extraction system for research use the stemsource equipment is available worldwide stem cell bankingedit in addition to use in laboratory research stemsource is the centerpiece of cytori’s stemsource cell bank platform for cryopreservation and storage of a patients’ adult stem and regenerative cells adrc’s the stemsource cell bank allows hospitals and companies to offer their patients the option of harvesting preparation and storage of their adipose tissue or their processed adrc’s once the adipose tissue is extracted and prepared using the stemsource equipment the storage technology freezes the tissuecells at  degrees celsius which drastically slows the metabolism of the cells preventing future aging or deterioration and preserving them for potential future use should clinical applications be approved by governmental authorities other research and applicationsedit the celution system is being used in japan and europe as tool for independent investigation and development of additional therapeutic uses of adrcs some of these investigations include stress urinary incontinence wound healing liver insufficiency renal
