entire process information on patents what is a patent search a patent search is performed to identify the most relevant existing and published us patents to your invention referred to as “prior art” typically searches are conducted in the early stages of the application process by an independent patent search firm who should conduct a patent search generally a patent search should be conducted by a professional patent search firm or registered patent attorney  agent who understands “class and subclass” patent searching as well as statutory requirements for patentability all inventionhome patent searches are conducted by independent patent attorneys or agents why is a patent search important a patent search of all existing us patents can provide excellent information to help an inventor make a decision on whether or not to move forward with an idea the search is primarily focused on determining whether a patent on a similar invention has already been issued or published with the united states patent and trademark office uspto although patent searching is a valuable step in the process it is important to understand that it can never guarantee with certainty that your invention will or will not be approved by the us patent and trademark office patent searching  inventionhome your home for inventing questions  start your provisional patent it begins with our free

completing our step inventor process professional support every step of the way youll work with the same experienced support team through our entire process information on provisional patents what is a provisional patent application ppa a provisional patent application ppa is a quick easy and costeffective way to get your invention on file with the us patent  trademark office uspto a ppa enables you to establish a priority filing date for your patent and provides  months of protection to further develop market or prepare a utility application once you file a ppa a month clock starts in which time a nonprovisional patent application must be filed before the end of the month provisional application period a provisional application is not examined by the uspto and does not automatically convert to a nonprovisional patent how does inventionhome simplify the application process inventionhome uses a network of highly qualified patent attorneys and agents to assist our clients in filing provisional patent applications at the lowest possible cost our streamlined system allows us to compile edit and communicate invention information between inventors and patent attorneys  agents therefore we can offer a costeffective service for preparing and filing provisional patent applications what is a nonprovisional patent the nonprovisional patent is what is traditionally thought of as the “full” patent it can be of either a “utility” or a “design” variety and it establishes the filing date and begins the uspto’s patent review process it is the only type of application that will result in the issuance of a patent whereas a provisional patent application acts as a placeholder for the priority date and allows you to retain “patent pending” status for your invention why do you need a patent in the first place patents protect your idea for a limited amount of time and prevent others from copying making and selling your idea as their own the patent gives you the right to make use and sell your invention and essentially provides you with a competitive advantage or monopoly on your invention for the length of the patent term if you do not have patent protection your idea or invention can be quickly replicated and reproduced without your consent when a company licenses an invention they are typically licensing the patent rights not the invention itself   jarrod m patten

entire process information on patents what is a patent search a patent search is performed to identify the most relevant existing and published us patents to your invention referred to as “prior art” typically searches are conducted in the early stages of the application process by an independent patent search firm who should conduct a patent search generally a patent search should be conducted by a professional patent search firm or registered patent attorney  agent who understands “class and subclass” patent searching as well as statutory requirements for patentability all inventionhome patent searches are conducted by independent patent attorneys or agents why is a patent search important a patent search of all existing us patents can provide excellent information to help an inventor make a decision on whether or not to move forward with an idea the search is primarily focused on determining whether a patent on a similar invention has already been issued or published with the united states patent and trademark office uspto although patent searching is a valuable step in the process it is important to understand that it can never guarantee with certainty that your invention will or will not be approved by the us patent and trademark office patent searching  inventionhome your home for inventing questions  start your provisional patent it begins with our free

completing our step inventor process professional support every step of the way youll work with the same experienced support team through our entire process information on provisional patents what is a provisional patent application ppa a provisional patent application ppa is a quick easy and costeffective way to get your invention on file with the us patent  trademark office uspto a ppa enables you to establish a priority filing date for your patent and provides  months of protection to further develop market or prepare a utility application once you file a ppa a month clock starts in which time a nonprovisional patent application must be filed before the end of the month provisional application period a provisional application is not examined by the uspto and does not automatically convert to a nonprovisional patent how does inventionhome simplify the application process inventionhome uses a network of highly qualified patent attorneys and agents to assist our clients in filing provisional patent applications at the lowest possible cost our streamlined system allows us to compile edit and communicate invention information between inventors and patent attorneys  agents therefore we can offer a costeffective service for preparing and filing provisional patent applications what is a nonprovisional patent the nonprovisional patent is what is traditionally thought of as the “full” patent it can be of either a “utility” or a “design” variety and it establishes the filing date and begins the uspto’s patent review process it is the only type of application that will result in the issuance of a patent whereas a provisional patent application acts as a placeholder for the priority date and allows you to retain “patent pending” status for your invention why do you need a patent in the first place patents protect your idea for a limited amount of time and prevent others from copying making and selling your idea as their own the patent gives you the right to make use and sell your invention and essentially provides you with a competitive advantage or monopoly on your invention for the length of the patent term if you do not have patent protection your idea or invention can be quickly replicated and reproduced without your consent when a company licenses an invention they are typically licensing the patent rights not the invention itself
