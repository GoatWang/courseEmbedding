search  stocks with teslalike return potential looking for the next bagger here are three stocks with incredible growth potential keith noonan dan caplinger and rich duprey keithnoonan jul   at am tesla shares have climbed more than  since the companys  initial public offering and more than  over the last five years thanks to investor confidence in its ability to revolutionize the automotive and battery industries  to give readers some leads on stocks that have the potential to match and perhaps even exceed teslas incredible performance we assembled a team of three motley fool investors and asked each member to spotlight a company that could deliver tremendous returns going forward read on to learn why they think sunpower corporation nasdaqspwr truecar nasdaqtrue and bofi holding inc nasdaqbofi have serious breakout potential image source getty images let this stock shine for you dan caplinger sunpower the solar industry has cooled off considerably in recent years falling oil prices have had a negative impact on the industry because alternatives to solar power are less costly when prices of fossil fuels used to generate electricity are low nevertheless the longterm future for solar power looks bright especially as the need for renewable energy becomes more extreme sunpower has built its business as a leader in the solar industry and it has some of the best prospects to shine in the decades ahead sunpowers main challenge recently has been figuring out how to make its groundbreaking technology more affordable the company is the undisputed leader among major industry players for producing the most efficient panels but their efficiency advantages arent substantial enough to outweigh the higher cost compared to lowerefficiency products that its rivals produce however sunpower hopes to use its oasis platform to make it far easier for its largescale utility customers to improve their solar plants as technology improves for now sunpower stock is stuck in a slump trading near its lowest levels in more than five years given the current negative environment for solar even a glimpse of a turnaround could reverse sentiment and send sunpower shares higher when you add to that the potential for increased awareness of the need for renewable solutions investors could well see the same future returns for sunpower that tesla shareholders have already enjoyed no haggling over its potential rich duprey truecar if there was one thing gms old saturn car company had going for it it was its nohaggle pricing policy you simply paid the stick price on the windshield and you couldnt go across town to another dealer and try to get something better unfortunately the policy was applied to subpar cars such as the outlook sky and vue while car buyers dont like haggling they will do it if it means they can save money on a goodquality car truecar takes that policy and does it one better so that you dont even have to change out of your pajamas and leave your house to do it working with a network of over  newcar dealers car buyers select the vehicle they want from truecars website and discover the average price others paid for that same car they can then be connected to local dealers who will provide their best price on the vehicle that the buyer can accept or continue shopping truecar gets paid when a deal is accepted and in the first quarter of  that amounted to  per vehicle on average although thats down slightly from last years  monetization average it facilitated  more transactions than the yearago period and saw a  bounce in the number of unique visitors to its site the carbuying portal is not yet profitable but losses narrowed in the period from  per share to  and revenues rose  year over year it has several new initiatives it is launching to make its service invaluable to car buyers such as an adfree platform for carmakers to showcase all their vehicles to buyers as well as reviews of cars from verified owners the stock has more than doubled over the past year but with analysts forecasting it to grow earnings  annually for the next five years it looks as though the carbuying portal wont be dickering over its longterm potential this company could change banking keith noonan bank of internet holding the trend of retail migrating to the internet is already well documented but there hasnt been as much coverage of industries like banking moving away from brick and mortar and toward the web sure banking stalwarts have successfully rolled out online banking apps but bank of internets onlineonly model has revolutionary potential that could supercharge your portfolio in the last quarter the companys efficiency ratio or expenses as a percentage of revenue came in at just  thats significantly below its longterm target of an efficiency ratio between  and  and dramatically below the  ratio thats viewed as the optimal standard for the traditional banking industry its low operating costs also allow it to offer its customers lower lending rates  an advantage that could facilitate explosive growth and create a longterm moat   bofi is already profitable and has grown net income roughly  over the last nine months compared to the prioryear period that might not sound like the the sort of highflying growth that points to a stock with explosive potential but the fact that its business isnt built around brickandmortar locations means that it has the potential to expand quickly and inexpensively with a market cap of roughly  billion the company still has plenty of room to run and the stock looks inexpensive with a forward pe or of roughly  the downside is that bofi holding is currently being investigated for money laundering but for investors looking for massive returns the risk could be worth it   dan caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned keith noonan has no position in any stocks mentioned rich duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares
