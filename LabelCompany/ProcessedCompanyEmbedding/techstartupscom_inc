time check out how these entrepreneurs are using technology to try to make their brands household names in  by john brandon john brandon is a contributing editor at inc magazine covering technology he writes the tech report column for inccom jmbrandonbb contributing editor inccomjmbrandonbb  comments credit istock light bulb moments happen frequently in the tech world you might be driving home from a day job and think what if i created a social network for dog owners or how could i capitalize on the iphones popularity and build my own app unlike some other industries costs for starting a tech company can inflate quickly  for web hosting servers and hiring a staff yet these brand new tech startups took a brilliant idea and turned it into a fledgling company that is ready to take on the world heres how each business owner started their company how the technology works and their projections for success thredup thredup started in october  as the brainchild of james reinhart his official bio says he is the chief knitwit initially the site allowed you to send in a shirt you didnt want anymore and receive a shirt in the mail at a low cost  almost like a netflix for clothes reinhart says around the time he and his wife were expecting their first child he kept hearing from customers who wanted a service for swapping out kids clothing the site refocused and revamped then relaunched in april  the idea is that you first pick a box of used clothing in the size your child needs and pay  plus shipping then you pack up about  clothing items thredup provides the box for free and send that in when someone else orders your box you receive the clothes you picked initially reinhart says the company is considering a swap system for maternity clothes and just added discussion forum feature thuuzcom edgeofyourseat moments in sports are rare  few football matches end in a nailbiter and some college basketball games are total routs since most of us are too busy to watch these games live and the latest dvrs can record hundreds of shows its easier to just record and forget them yet knowing which games are worth watching and deliver the thrills is often difficult warren packard realized this while watching a dull chicago bears game last fall one that ended in a  defeat during the game he decided to figure out a way to cull only the best moments in recent sporting events then post the details about the game online for example one posting instructs site visitors to watch only the last five minutes of an georgia bulldogs college game his site called thuuzcomuses an algorithm he invented that tracks up to  statistics in a game such as long passes and touchdown runs the site does not show any video clips or scores but lists the portion of the game that is the most exciting with an overall rating about its entertainment value this year they plan it include soccer and nhl games chocri sometimes love can make you do some crazy things it can also lead to some brilliant entrepreneurial ideas about two years ago german entrepreneur franz duge was selling chocolate fountains on ebay to make extra money as a college student at the time he couldnt find the right gift for his girlfriend so he devised a way to order a chocolate bar made with custom ingredients and toppings at the site you can choose from four base chocolates and from  different toppings like basil and strawberry carmen magar who is the ceo for the us version of chocri says the company can produce as many as  custom bars per month  and they are all handmade she says one of the challenges they have is in scaling the company in order to scale up we just received an investment from ritter which bought a third of our shares for a low seven digit figure we are investing that in our production to automate more elements of the process to be able to scale more says magar twisplays chris anderson the author of the book free and wireds editorinchief says were in a transition from physical atoms to digital bits dont tell that to joshua persky the former nyc banker kept getting light bulb moments about an led display that shows twitter feeds these character messages can include weather info status updates sports scores or anything you can find on twitter persky had a banking client who created plasma tv advertising for a local bar he is an mit graduate so he already gets the technology including networking aspects and costs he also heard about another business that uses led signs on vending machines and had seen twitter feeds on massive signs in times square he built a prototype twisplay and friends on linkedincom said they loved the idea persky said he had orders waiting before the product was even ready for launch the displays measure xx so they are small enough to sit in the back of a conference room or in your cubicle to use them you connect the display to your laptop which provides the internet connection some models connect to a cell phone network my business plan is to sell  signs by november  putting twisplays revenues at  to  we just sold three customized tenfoot twisplays to a social media restaurant in nyc and are in negotiations with a large

founderserin griffithsep  when the founder of a startup company shuts down her or his business its customary to pen an essay that tells the rest of the community what went wrong call it a failure postmortem nine out of  startups fail which is why the failure postmortem has become so common that its practically a silicon valley cliché some of these essays are honest enlightening and brave others point fingers or issue backward nonapologies medium the publishing platform is the preferred mediumthe proliferation of the failure postmortem has helped create a bizarre cult of failure that seems wrongheaded celebrating failure “fail fast” goes the mantra seems to let people off the hook for bad behavior upon closer inspection it seems less misguided than necessary starting a highgrowth business is a roller coaster founderceos feel pressure to keep up the facade of success even when things are actually falling apart behind the scenes only recently after the tragic suicide of jody sherman ceo of a startup called ecomom did the technology community begin to publicly acknowledge the problems with its “entrepreneur as hero” narrative publicly admitting to failure and examining it can take guts it also distills the narrative to a case study from which other entrepreneurs can learncb insights recently parsed  postmortem essays by startup founders to pinpoint the reasons they believe their company failed on thursday the company crunched the numbers to reveal that the numberone reason for failure cited by  of polled startups is the lack of a market need for their productthat should be selfevident if no one wants your product your company isn’t going to succeed but many startups build things people don’t want with the irrational hope that theyll convince them otherwisethe most prominent modern example of this phenomenon is the mobile phone people dismissed it as a novelty in its early days obviously cell phones are no longer a novelty the late apple cofounder steve jobs famously said “a lot of times people dont know what they want until you show it to them” the problem is that entrepreneurs have taken that to heart for every  billion company like uber the private transportation service there are countless frivolous products that never catch onbeyond the idea there are more practical reasons startups fail polled founders also cited a lack of sufficient capital  the assembly of the wrong team for the project  and superior competition  as top reasons for failurethe selfassessment lines up for the most part with what industry experts have said paul graham a partner at the y combinator startup accelerator wrote in  that startups usually die because they run out of money or a founder leavessteve hogan who runs a startup turnaround shop called techrx says companies with founded by one person—that is no partners—are most likely to fail he ranks product demand or a lack thereof second the existence of a cofounder helps avoid many of the reasons cited at the bottom of the cb insights chart he says including disharmony poor marketing and the wrong teamrunning out of cash does not cause a startups failure hogan says—its merely a symptom of another issue excluding instances of “stupid spending” or the inability to raise capital in the first place startups tend to run out of cash when a ceo has overlooked all other indicators of failure “unfortunately sometimes its the only ‘symptom’ that the leadership sees” he sayscustomer servicesite mapprivacy policyadvertisingad choicesterms of useyour california privacy rightscareers
