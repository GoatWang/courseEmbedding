everyone i just recently found out about this supplemental annuity collective trust sact that new jersey offers i wanted to start a discussion on this sact i am in the early stages of my research i will share everything i have learned thus far i am hoping some other people from new jersey have experience or advice or if anyone else has ever researched it or is interested in looking through the informationmy ultimate goal is to see if its worth investing in information is very limited online about the sact and trying to track down the stocks they invest in is tougheligibility employees who

covered by the state but krow from here on bogleheads questions thatviewtopicphpti believe that although the fees of the sact fund are not disclosed they exist and are subtracted from the unreported but calculable rate of return ror every mutual fund or portfolio of mutual funds has expenses the sact fund expenses are subtracted out of its returns before they report their unit valueskrow also compared the sact i also found the unit values page for the supplemental annuity collective trust sact but was hoping they provide the rate of return over the years maybe they aren’t all that proud of their ror i used the unit values for december for some recent years and calculated the ror for a comparison i used vanguard’s lifestrategy moderate growth which uses a  asset allocation and includes international stocks and bonds i noticed that the unit values for  were incomplete and  was missingsact ror——lsmg ror——————— ———————— ——————— ——————— ———— —— ———————— the sact is very opaque and

this information so we can construct a balanced diversified portfolio i noticed on one of your links the form is dated  forget about the specific sponsor for a minute what is your question and then a

challenge taxsheltered annuities and win  back to top  krow krow members  posts posted  june    pm fireman im online only occasionally this summer and just spotted your thread i dont envy you trying to decide whether sact is worth using or not my guess its a black box designed to make money for the financial industry sact earns a return but takes a greater risk than a vg balanced fund like their life strategy fund of funds   you might be better using a mutual fund product with valic not an annuity product youd know the expense ratio and other fees   a further problem you need to consider is that nj doesnt let you defer your b and b contributions from your income it seems to me that a big advantage to contributing to taxdeferred accounts isnt there for you    i think a taxable account for  retirement at vg has some advantages over deferred accounts for nj residents that you should consider   back to top  fireman fireman members  posts posted  july    pm thank you for your responses sschullo and krow   my initial question was to see if this sact was worth investing into a little background on me which i failed to provide i am a professional firefighter in new jersey i have  years on the job and after  years i can retire and collect a pension   of my last year completed salary  now the pension system is underfunded and there is a lot of worrying by nj employees that our pension will still be available the way it is written up now   my wife is pregnant with our first child and is due in october so this has really woken up in setting up a life insurance policy on myself and on my wife and setting up retirement accounts i will be turning  in august and i will be  when i complete  years with the option to retire   b is available in my city  metlife axa and valic are the options and all are annuities based after gathering all the information valic is the best option  having the lowest fees and vanguard available as an investment option    the fees on vg lifestrategy acquired fund fees   total fund fees   net fund expenses   net separate account fees    this includes the mortality and expense fees total net variable account account option fees     i dont know a lot about fees but these dont seem very bloated and are lower then the majority of options from axa and metlife   currently i have been dumping all my money into a credit union that offers  saving accounts and compounds daily i always thought i wouldnt need any retirement accounts with this guaranteed  interest  but everyone says it is good to diversify which is why i was going to do a b and also thinking of investing in the sact  i dont know a lot about ira and roth ira  the main thing that attracts me to the b is tax deferred and i can withdraw all my money if i decide to retire at  years old   ira and roth ira i believe you must be  to pull your money out     back to top  tony tony members  posts posted  july    pm fireman   you need to hang around this site and learn all you can about investing at your age you should be mostly in stocks you are right to say you need to diversify a bank wont help you get over the hump for retirement you should save as if you wont get a pension because one never knows the future better to be safe too many folks i have known in education count on their pensions and dont save i always ask them what if the pension was taken away from you or reduced how would you make it better to cover all your bases and yes you and your wife should have life insurance go with term insurance does your local city employer offer you any investments options or insurance options    in your situation currently after having enough liquid savings in a  bank or money market savings  account i would invest directly in a roth ira through vanguard your wife may be eligible as well you can read more on roth accounts on this site   keep saving and keep learning but beware of financial advisors unless they are fee only and with a reputable organization stay away from insurance companies that pedal annuities use insurance companies only for insurance and not investing   tony back to top  sschullo sschullo members  posts gendermale posted  july    pm fireman any lifestrategy funds are popular these days as the managers rebalance the holdings as you get closer to retirement   btw what credit union pays  on its savings account it must be some type of stable value or some kind of agreement my credit union and  of savings accounts everywhere else is paying something in the order of    steve steve schullo author and coauthor of two books  late

posts posted  july    pm hey tony     thanks for the tips and advice i definitely will be hanging around this site to learn more my city just offers the  b plan through those three options i listed and the sact i talked about in my original post is offered by the state   i see myself bouncing from the  tax brackets through the rest of my career  depending on if my wife is working or not in certain years filing jointly i would retire and have a lower salary through the pension then i did while i was working however the tax brackets will pretty much almost be the same or slightly different  so based off that theory i would assume the traditional ira is more aligned towards my situation    and a negative would be that i couldnt touch the money until i am      on average professional firefighters dont live very long lives  back to top  fireman fireman members  posts posted  july    pm steve  its a credit union in my city they are constantly giving out loans to city workers for  or  and that is why they can offer a higher interest rate in the savings what did you think of the fees i mentioned by valic for the  b plan for that vg lifestrategy investment back to top  tony tony members  posts posted  july    pm fireman   i have been trying and accomplishing  to consolidate most of my funds into the life strategy moderate growth fund which has a  allocation all in index  funds outside of this i am buying only extra  bonds  i am trying to have only two fundfour funds total you will be paying much more for the life strategy than i am i am paying  total and you should not have to pay  for the same fund  i realize your options are limited thats why you should go direct with an ira first before considering what to do next   thankyou for being a firefighter you guys dont always get the attention and respect you deserve      tony back to top  sschullo sschullo members  posts gendermale posted  july    am steve  its a credit union in my city they are constantly giving out loans to city workers for  or  and that is why they can offer a higher interest rate in the savings what did you think of the fees i mentioned by valic for the  b plan for that vg lifestrategy investment   hi fire yeah but dont all credit unions give out loans or other expensive services when i have a check that draws from my overbalance account wow they charge a lot obviously i am very careful about using that service so  whatever reason you are fortunate i would use it for a portion of your fixed account all portfolios no matter what your age should have a portion in fixed accounts sure bond funds might pay a little more but there are interest rate changes which add risk that is not in a savings account   talk to a valic rep and ask him or her about the total fees that you will be paying remember these folks are under no obligation whether legal or not to be transparent about fees the vast majority of reps tell you a portion but not the entire picture for the information you gave it looks like its a variable annuity with me fees me fees are a totally unnecessary cost to protect your investment thats the sales pitch but its really a total rip off for that reason alone it doesnt look like a good option because of the fees in just about all variable annuity contracts the only low cost va is from tiaa   keep looking and tell us what you found you are looking for funds that diversify your portfolio look for a new thread that i will start where i show my portfolio and what a fully diversified portfolio looks like as i said in another post i got a  return ytd   happy th steve steve schullo author and coauthor of two books  late bloomer millionaires a financial story and investment guide for the late starter   fighting powerful interests educators challenge taxsheltered annuities and win  back to top  fireman fireman members  posts posted  july    pm thank you for the kind words tony  steve these are the fees for valic the fees on vg lifestrategy acquired fund fees   total fund fees   net fund expenses   net separate account fees    this includes the mortality and expense fees total net variable account account option fees     the fees are not very high compared to other life insurance companies for variable annuities for  b plans that i have seen however i know i should stay away from variable annunities  in my case though i dont have any other options through my city i have scheduled a meeting on july  with my city plan administrator i am going to try and convince her to bring in vanguard or fidelity to offer b plans to us so we can benefit from the low fees if it does not work out then i will most likely go with valic to take advantage of the tax deferred plan   also tony suggested for me to open a roth ira i have done research on it the past couple of days  i want to open one now as it looks like a great option to even further diversity my portfolio however who should i go through for the roth ira  everyone talks highly of vanguard but there are so many options out there   and if you could provide me some direction on where to invest in the roth ira i would greatly appreciate it i am turning  and would not be able to withdraw until  more years i would be depositing the max  every single year and my final question after i pick my investment options within the roth ira   would i just leave it alone for the next  more years or do i need to monitor it and change around my investment options every few years or so back to top  sschullo sschullo members  posts gendermale posted  july    pm you could start with vanguard wellington a  stock  bond allocation for your roth call vanguard and open up an account with wellington you can leave it alone until you reach your s but that is a long time you need to keep an eye on your portfolio as it grows you might need to rebalance which is another topic and learn not to panic when there is a crash and to have a plan you understand   i suggest that you read the bogleheads guide to investing find it here on amazon as tony already suggested you have some learning to do but you have a great start and this book will answer all of your questions  steve schullo author and coauthor of two books  late bloomer millionaires a financial story and investment guide for the late starter   fighting powerful interests educators challenge taxsheltered annuities and win  back to top  tony tony members  posts posted  july    pm wellingtion would be great choice one of the few great performing managed funds so would the vanguard star fund only  opening minimum or a target date fund  that matches up with your retirement date or close to it and it is self managed you could also do the same  life strategy fund in your ira as well as doing it with valic eventually your roth life strategy with vanguard will ourperform because of lower fees than with valic   who should you go through for your roth ira   vanguard because of the low fees and honest management  why pay more  paying more gets you nothing more it only gets you less   also yes you need to leave it alone until retirement thats what it would be for you will be rewarded if you keep adding to it and leave it alone for  years or so if the fund at some point disappoints you you can easily move it to a different vanguard fund but dont go chasing performance because its a game you wont win   you are asking all the right questions at your age  keep doing what you are doing and dont be afraid to ask questions and to pursue better choices     tony back to top  krow krow members  posts posted  july    pm fireman youre getting great advice i agree with tony and i suggest you invest annually in a ira for both you and your wife remember your wife doesnt have to be employed she can contribute based on your salary either a roth or a traditional would be ok you can do some of both and change which to use later when you learn about the pros and cons of each i dont think you can go wrong with a roth ira at this stage of your career   if you can confirm that the valic b has a total fee of  using the lsmg i think it would be worth contributing to since its your best deferred compensation choice     if you can contribute k in iras and k in the b and are able to contribute more to your retirement then i think it comes down to either the sact or using a taxable account at vanguard i think i would vote for vanguard    i think i misstated the nj policy on tax deductibility in my post above i should have said that deferred contributions are not deferred from nj state income tax but are deferred from federal income tax perhaps nj firefighters are exempted from this    back to top page  of    next back to b forum also tagged with one or more of these keywords
