america that prefers mustard over ketchup on hot dogs so of course that is where chicago and pittsburghbased kraft heinz nasdaq khc has gone to see if it could trick chicagoans into going for heinz ketchup on a hot dog instead of the preferred mustard enlarge chicagoans are being encouraged to try a new product from kraft heinz the company timed the introduction of its cagily branded chicago dog sauce in the windy city to coincide with todays designation as national hot dog day kraft heinz has priced the gimmicky sauce at  a bottle plus shipping and handling of orders placed at chicagodogsaucecom the fact that kraft heinz isnt taking up valuable grocery store shelf space in chicago to entice locals to try chicago dog sauce certainly suggests the company doesnt have great expectations for this gimmicky little ploy but its a ploy that at least will remind chicagoans focused on mustard that heinz ketchup will always be there as an alternative if the day ever arrives when they have a yen for the red stuff instead of the yellow on their wieners not likely but you never know in any event kraft heinz says it will support the introduction of its chicago dog sauce with

headlines kraft heinz aims to boost sales with new products cross branding alex nixon  saturday june    pm email newsletters sign up for one of our email newsletters growth is getting harder to come by for the biggest packaged food companies as consumers look for healthier options at the supermarket and avoid some of the heavily processed fare offered by major food manufacturers pittsburghbased kraft heinz co is battling the trend by introducing products that emphasize natural and organic ingredients adjusting some items with an upscale look and expanding into new categories the new products have been anything but revolutionary but small changes can make a big difference with consumers experts say kraft heinz since february has rolled out an organic version of its capri sun fruit drinks and removed all artificial flavors colors and preservatives from its mainstay kraft mac  cheese dinners the company expanded its condiment offerings in april with the introduction of heinz branded bbq sauces including kansas city sweet  smoky and carolina tangy vinegar to appeal to premiumbrand shoppers kraft heinz in april introduced classico riserva pasta sauces with no artificial ingredients or added sugar and macaroni and cheese meals flavored with varieties of cracker barrel cheddar cheese the worlds fifthlargest food and beverage company has surprised some observers with early success lifting sales during a challenging time when many of its peers have struggled to find growth the companys executive team led by ceo bernardo hees was known for its expertise in cutting costs but not for organic growth expenses dropped  percent a year after they took iconic ketchup maker hj heinz private in  but sales declined  percent to  billion over the same period as the company eliminated unprofitable products hees pursued revenue growth through a merger with chicagobased kraft foods group in  less than a year after completing the that merger hees and his team are being hailed both for product development and cutting costs kraft heinz posted a  percent increase in us sales to  billion when it announced firstquarter results last month the company beat analysts prediction of a sales decline in the united states with gains from highprotein lunchables meal packs and increases from its food service business which started selling oscar mayer hot dogs to fast food chain burger king in february kraft heinz and burger king are partly owned by g capital  “our emphasis on profitable sales growth is paying off” hees told analysts during a conference call last month “our market share trends are improving behind innovation and marketing investments” brittany weissman an analyst with edward jones in st louis said kraft heinz is doing a good job of expanding existing brands to more consumers in the united states “theyve always said from the beginning that they plan to focus on big bet innovation to drive sales” she said “however how this innovation has translated into results has been a pleasant surprise” raphael moreau an analyst at market research firm euromonitor international in london called kraft heinzs performance “counterintuitive” given the “stagnant growth” in many food categories in which the company sells products us food sales performance has been mixed in the past  months according to data from market research firm nielsen unit sales of pasta sauces were down  percent in the  weeks ended april  unit sales of nuts fell  percent over the same period but refrigerated condiments and cheese posted gains of  percent and  percent respectively while pasta sauces may be struggling classico riserva hits on a trend of consumers wanting companies to remove preservatives and other artificial ingredients from their food riserva has no added sugar which fits with another desire of american shoppers “sugar is the no  thing that consumers want out of their diet” said darren seifer a food industry analyst at npd group a new york research company kraft heinz is taking advantage of the trend in cheese with its highprotein p lunchables meal pack a cobranded product that combines kraft cheese oscar mayer meats and planters nuts and its bbq sauces fit with higher demand for condiments moreau said he would like to see kraft heinz build on its success with p lunchables and come out with more cobranded products and healthy snacks the food manufacturers experiencing the biggest growth have products that are proteinrich and perceived as more natural according to an april report from iri worldwide a chicagobased market research company also a headwind for kraft heinz is a move by some consumers to buy from smaller companies more than  billion in industry sales have shifted away from the largest companies to smaller players since  the iri report found younger consumers are “a little less trusting of those big corporations” seifer said but companies can counteract the sentiment by touting efforts around environmental sustainability and humane treatment of animals he said kraft heinz in march said it would only use eggs from cagefree hens in north american products by  part of an initiative pushed by the humane society of the united states kraft heinz spokesman michael mullen said the company is “committed to pushing the boundaries of innovation” through what it calls its “big bets” strategy that thoroughly tests new products with consumers before releasing them and then puts a larger advertising budget behind their launches the company has said it will spend  million more this year on advertising the companys first big bets were heinz mustard which was launched in  and featured in a series of ads and allnatural kraft mac  cheese introduced this spring “at kraft heinz our big bets will continue to ramp up as the year progresses covering a full spectrum of innovation we look forward to sharing more exciting news with our consumers in the months ahead” mullen said alex nixon is a tribunereview

the globe” mr behring saiddespite the deal’s size former regulators did not expect significant antitrust hurdles“these product lines seem to be more complementary but where they find any overlaps they
