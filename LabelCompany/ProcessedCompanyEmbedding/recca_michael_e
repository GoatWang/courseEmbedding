reengineered harvey an interview with michael e recca interim chief executive officer and chief restructuring officer harvey electronics inc editors’ note prior to assuming his current role in  michael recca held posts with deloitte cralin  co ltd and the weatherly cos he later served as ceo of vroman foods he became harvey electronics’ chairman in  and has remained on the board since then recca also served as an officer and director of sky capital holdings before becoming a selfemployed financial reconstruction consultant company brief harvey electronics inc is a specialty retailer and custom installer of highquality audio and video consumer electronics and home theater products in the metropolitan new york area founded in  harvey operates stores in new york and new jersey one of its stores operates under the bang  olufsen brand name offering audio and video components made by the danish company harvey filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection in december  and expects to emerge from bankruptcy in  you took over harvey electronics at a challenging time what excited you about that opportunity i’ve been involved with harvey in varying degrees for a long time i discovered the company in chapter  in the mid ’s and we successfully emerged from it the management team and i built a company that grew very rapidly from about  million in revenue to approximately  million i became less involved in  and got parachuted back into the structure of the company in the summer of  we ultimately filed for bankruptcy in the fall of  i think there’s a tremendous opportunity in the market for a reengineered harvey when i was first involved with the company we migrated from being a pricecompetitive retailer competing against the wiz and other massmarket retailers to become a highend audio and video retailer we were successful at that for a while but you can buy a sophisticated flatscreen television pretty much anywhere we can’t compete with best buy circuit city or other larger retailers on price simply because of their volumes but we can compete in the service aspect of the business we’re not selling products we’re selling the integration of those products into an environment to be frank if you want to buy a inch tv and hang it on a wall you won’t get the best deal at harvey if you’re looking for that television to be integrated into a home theater and a multiroom audiovisual system that can store hundreds of dvds and cds that can be accessed throughout the home we offer those services which are not available through the massmarket retailers i see that becoming an increasingly attractive service to consumers we are at the forefront of providing that kind of service and have an yearold brand name that people trust what advantages does chapter  status give you at this time we have a restructuring plan in place that includes the reduction of our retail footprint we’re not selling products that go into someone’s trunk and then into his home we’re selling a service that takes months to complete so we don’t need  square feet of retail space we can offer our services very effectively in  square feet through the bankruptcy process we are able to shed our excess retail spaces and other costs in short order so it really accelerates what we can accomplish over time saves us time and narrows our focus has the economic downturn in the united states impacted your business it hasn’t shown up yet i joke that we don’t have to worry about the recession because we’ve had our own for the past two years would i be happier if it was three years ago and the housing market was raging sure am i terribly worried about this no our customers are somewhat insulated from economic downturns no one is recessionproof but our customers are wealthier older and more insulated than the customers of massmarket retailers so i think we’re okay and hopefully this turbulence will pass quickly and we’ll move on is there a major difference in the way you’re addressing harvey’s reengineering now compared to how you did so in the mid ’s it’s absolutely different the first time the company attempted to be a very price competitive retailer and failed miserably in that we were then able to occupy a market niche without a lot of competition we leveraged our brand’s reputation to sell a highend product the transition we’re going through now is somewhat different we’re moving from being a product company to being a service company that offers products today the product is far less meaningful than it was in the past these products have become commodities we believe we can capitalize on our ability to integrate these products into an experience that is exclusive and not replicable by most companies how does your current role differ from that of a typical ceo other than needing a lot of stomach lining the hardest part of working in this company is breaking the mold one of the things i tell the employees over and over again is “when you come to work today don’t think of what you did yesterday because what you did yesterday didn’t work” the company didn’t succeed so we have to look at everything we’re doing and find ways to do things differently what else could we be doing what don’t we need to do any more we have to break the status quo we have to change one would think it takes a certain kind of personality to take on this kind of challenge as an executive do you enjoy the challenge are you ever frustrated by the process the biggest advantage of chapter  is the ability it gives us to not worry about the past and just move forward so i don’t see that as challenging or frustrating at all click here to download a pdf of this article michael e recca executive profile  biography  bloomberg july    am et capital

michael e recca a reengineered harvey an interview with michael e recca interim chief executive officer and chief restructuring officer harvey electronics inc editors’ note prior to assuming his current role in  michael recca held posts with deloitte cralin  co ltd and the weatherly cos he later served as ceo of vroman foods he became harvey electronics’ chairman in  and has remained on the board since then recca also served as an officer and director of sky capital holdings before becoming a selfemployed financial reconstruction consultant company brief harvey electronics inc is a specialty retailer and custom installer of highquality audio and video consumer electronics and home theater products in the metropolitan new york area founded in  harvey operates stores in new york and new jersey one of its stores operates under the bang  olufsen brand name offering audio and video components made by the danish company harvey filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection in december  and expects to emerge from bankruptcy in  you took over harvey electronics at a challenging time what excited you about that opportunity i’ve been involved with harvey in varying degrees for a long time i discovered the company in chapter  in the mid ’s and we successfully emerged from it the management team and i built a company that grew very rapidly from about  million in revenue to approximately  million i became less involved in  and got parachuted back into the structure of the company in the summer of  we ultimately filed for bankruptcy in the fall of  i think there’s a tremendous opportunity in the market for a reengineered harvey when i was first involved with the company we migrated from being a pricecompetitive retailer competing against the wiz and other massmarket retailers to become a highend audio and video retailer we were successful at that for a while but you can buy a sophisticated flatscreen television pretty much anywhere we can’t compete with best buy circuit city or other larger retailers on price simply because of their volumes but we can compete in the service aspect of the business we’re not selling products we’re selling the integration of those products into an environment to be frank if you want to buy a inch tv and hang it on a wall you won’t get the best deal at harvey if you’re looking for that television to be integrated into a home theater and a multiroom audiovisual system that can store hundreds of dvds and cds that can be accessed throughout the home we offer those services which are not available through the massmarket retailers i see that becoming an increasingly attractive service to consumers we are at the forefront of providing that kind of service and have an yearold brand name that people trust what advantages does chapter  status give you at this time we have a restructuring plan in place that includes the reduction of our retail footprint we’re not selling products that go into someone’s trunk and then into his home we’re selling a service that takes months to complete so we don’t need  square feet of retail space we can offer our services very effectively in  square feet through the bankruptcy process we are able to shed our excess retail spaces and other costs in short order so it really accelerates what we can accomplish over time saves us time and narrows our focus has the economic downturn in the united states impacted your business it hasn’t shown up yet i joke that we don’t have to worry about the recession because we’ve had our own for the past two years would i be happier if it was three years ago and the housing market was raging sure am i terribly worried about this no our customers are somewhat insulated from economic downturns no one is recessionproof but our customers are wealthier older and more insulated than the customers of massmarket retailers so i think we’re okay and hopefully this turbulence will pass quickly and we’ll move on is there a major difference in the way you’re addressing harvey’s reengineering now compared to how you did so in the mid ’s it’s absolutely different the first time the company attempted to be a very price competitive retailer and failed miserably in that we were then able to occupy a market niche without a lot of competition we leveraged our brand’s reputation to sell a highend product the transition we’re going through now is somewhat different we’re moving from being a product company to being a service company that offers products today the product is far less meaningful than it was in the past these products have become commodities we believe we can capitalize on our ability to integrate these products into an experience that is exclusive and not replicable by most companies how does your current role differ from that of a typical ceo other than needing a lot of stomach lining the hardest part of working in this company is breaking the mold one of the things i tell the employees over and over again is “when you come to work today don’t think of what you did yesterday because what you did yesterday didn’t work” the company didn’t succeed so we have to look at everything we’re doing and find ways to do things differently what else could we be doing what don’t we need to do any more we have to break the status quo we have to change one would think it takes a certain kind of personality to take on this kind of challenge as an executive do you enjoy the challenge are you ever frustrated by the process the biggest advantage of chapter  is the ability it gives us to not worry about the past and just move forward so i don’t see that as challenging or frustrating at all click here to download a pdf of this article
