edition is available as a binder ready version and custom product only  new online chapter w “advanced laboratory experimentation sequences d e and f” contains content from chapter  of the previous edition green chemistry more discussion around green initiatives has been highlighted and added  a new icon points to green initiatives throughout the text a new th experiment in chapter  a new suzuki experiment highlights a wellestablished and green coupling process all text content has been edited clarified and updated to make the narrative more userfriendly and concise where possible see more see less the wiley advantage experiments have been thoroughly tested on several generations of students and are cost effective  working within a microscale framework the cost of equipment and reagents is kept low and experiments do not require the use of or disposal of toxic chemicals background information given with the reactions brings a rich historical perspective to the student which adds to the excitement of discovery and provides added motivation to master the fundamental techniques employed in the laboratory experiments offer strong instrumental focus  the student is responsible for generating most of his or her own data therefore students learn to become selfreliant provides instruction on microscale techniques for the professional research lab as well as the college classroom setting  these techniques are especially compatible in settings in which homegrown lab experiments are utilized a rich collection of end of chapter exercises and pre and post lab questions provide students with the valuable opportunity to test and practice their own understanding of each laboratory experiment a selection of experiments containing instructions for using microwave heating as a tool in synthetic organic chemistry placing an emphasis on greener processes to perform traditional experimentation  procedural sections allow for inquirybased experimentation that results in a more
