wordpressdedicated to wordpress servers optimally tuned to take advantage of wordpress use casesconsthey changed our pricing and charged the card without informing me in advance they made good on that but that was kind of a huh moment for me and the accounting departmenttheir attitude about plugin management including the global restriction of some plugins to optimize for the wpengine experience across all clients is quite different from most blog hosts and takes some getting used to reducing the flexibility of wordpress is crippling one of wordpresss key business advantagesoverage charges overage charges combined with restricting plugins in part due to bandwidth concerns thats two levels of reduced service to me for the good of the communityatlarge or is it for the good of wp engine

a guest blog post the post’s director of digital news projects greg barber discusses a new demo release of trust the first app from the coral project a collaboration between the post the new york times and the mozilla foundation that is focused on creating an opensource community platform for publishers and is funded by a grant from the knight foundation read on for barber’s post digital communities are havens of rich illuminating data comments replies shares deletes positive and negative reactions — all of which cascades to create live streams of conversation that at their best can elucidate and inspire it’s that data that the coral project team is unlocking in our new trust product shown publicly for the first time today at the sxsw interactive festival in austin texas our project’s overall goal is to help publishers build and enliven communities around their journalism through opensource software and renewed best practices the trust app is our first step toward that goal the trust app aims to scale the moderation of usergenerated contributions by focusing on the user’s history of contributions in addition to moderating individual contributions themselves through trust publishers can categorize users in two ways persistent tags examples this user is a medical doctor this user’s comments have been featured in an article and dynamic lists — groups that allow publishers to tee up groups of users based on their contribution history for example if a publisher wanted to find new users in the politics section who prompted conversation without violating the site’s discussion policy they could use this recipe total comments  less than  total replies received  more than  comments deleted   the trust app would serve up users who fit that description — and it could continue to do so dynamically without further action from the publisher trust is the first in a set of software applications that the coral project will release in beta form this year we’ll be working with teams at the post the times and other newsrooms to test the app and refine it before releasing it more widely anyone who is interested in contributing to the coral project or learning more about it is welcome to participate in our community read our blog or explore our github we’ve recently released a set of personas — archetypes that put a face on the people we’ve met and use cases we’ve gathered in more than  interviews with people from nearly  news organizations in  countries the coral project’s software development is a true team effort involving developers designers

founder of credit karma ken started credit karma with a mission to change how people interact with their finances making it easier to manage and more transparent kennethlin founder and ceo credit karmakennethlin write a comment credit getty images in business trust is earned and not given when consumers trust your product theyre happier and more engaged user acquisition becomes easier you put yourself in a position to make a real difference however trust can be elusive it is tricky to build and easily lost when credit karma was founded we were trying to offer free credit information in an industry where such promises usually resulted in fees and conditions to the endless frustration of consumers rather than serving as a business constraint this ended up doing us a favor setting out a path for us for what not to do the mistakes of companies before us meant our margin for error was small but served as a guide in how to gain and keep our members trust communicate how you are different know your story and tell it well stress what is different about your company we started credit karma in  to deliver transparency and offer free credit scores in a market where there was no such thing sites would market themselves as free while requiring their membership to enter costly subscription programs immediately we focused on communicating what elevated us we emphasized that no credit card would be needed because other free sites needed one to use their service we did everything to emphasize that we truly were free to let people know this wasnt a trick make trust a longterm investment trust doesnt happen overnight it is a long process filled with peaks and valleys your work is never over i see companies trip up constantly in thinking that because theyve done everything right this far customers might not notice if they take shortcuts trust can be quickly undone no matter how much hard work you put in prioritize it and invest in it for the long haul your product has to back up the trust youre asking for communication and patience are easily touted but your product needs to back it up every privacy policy and product feature needs to be developed with your credibility in mind when people saw that credit karma was free their next suspicion was that we were paying for it by selling our marketing lists to spammers we dont sell or rent personal information to third parties for any purpose and make that clear all over our site to relax on this would be to let all of our members down get the word out you need to be a storyteller for your point of difference after we were founded and as a team of just three with no marketing or pr associates i made a commitment to write  bloggers a personal email each night to get them to try out our product if they hated the product because it was bad that was fine luckily no one did but it was important that we got the word out that we really were free and did what we said we do prepare yourself that everyone is a cynic if youre entering into a vertical that generates negative sentiments and has had bad press you need to have a thick skin the space credit karma was operating in had a terrible reputation when we launched i had to reconcile myself that if i were an outsider here i would likely be thinking the same things everyone on the internet is a bit of a cynic you need to take it with a grain of salt dont sling mud you may be bringing honesty and ethics into a space that desperately needed it but you need to distance yourself from what came before no one wins from mudslinging games rather than yell at somebody else focus instead on talking about the positive attributes of your product and your ongoing vision if other companies try and bring your product down take it as a compliment that youre on their radars always be proving yourself trustworthy you need to live by the promises you make to your users everyday i want to prove all over again to our members and my team that im worthy of their trust if you betray that it can follow you around for a long time in the long run morals are the better business choice principles are easy when youre a new business with no customers but to maintain trust you need to lay out your mission and use it as a moral compass for everything you do you will reach points where you could make more money in the shortterm at the cost of the consumer and the companys overall wellbeing ultimately though sacrificing trust and goodwill for revenue in the short term will only serve to undercut the foundation of your company the
