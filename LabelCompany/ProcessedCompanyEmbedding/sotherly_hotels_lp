dedicated to understanding and serving our guests better than anyone else because we believe guests are the heart of every hotel that’s why we’ve made delivering true southern hospitality our central mission because to us southern hospitality isn’t a regional curiosity it’s an authentic experience that helps our guests see feel taste and enjoy everything the local culture has to offer both during their stay and after they leave our generations of hospitality experience have taught us that guests want their hotel to feel like a natural extension of the city they’re visiting – they want it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings like a front porch into a southern summer night we’ve designed our hotels with our guests in mind weaving our trademark southern charm into every corner of the guest experience to make sure that guests feel so connected to the local area and so refreshed by its culture that they’ll soon forget where the city ends and the hotel walls begin at the end of the day our guests are like our family – and we treat them as such  our ultimate goal is to turn moments into lasting memories that will keep guests coming back time and time again and it’s our belief that happy guests lead to happy shareholders sotherly foundation the sotherly foundation is the community outreach arm of sotherly hotels we created the foundation in  because we wanted to take a more handson approach to making a difference in the communities surrounding our hotels one family at a time each year the sotherly foundation will provide significant aid to one or more american veterans living in the communities around its hotels instead of taking a onesizefitsall approach we work directly with the veteran and his or her family to find out what they need most and to determine a strategy for meeting that need in the most lasting and meaningful way possible all recipients are chosen by the sotherly foundation board of directors with assistance from qualified organizations like the united states marine corps wounded warrior regiment the majority of all funds raised comes from the hard work and caring dedication of the employees of our hotels although the foundation does

dedicated to understanding and serving our guests better than anyone else because we believe guests are the heart of every hotel that’s why we’ve made delivering true southern hospitality our central mission because to us southern hospitality isn’t a regional curiosity it’s an authentic experience that helps our guests see feel taste and enjoy everything the local culture has to offer both during their stay and after they leave our generations of hospitality experience have taught us that guests want their hotel to feel like a natural extension of the city they’re visiting – they want it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings like a front porch into a southern summer night we’ve designed our hotels with our guests in mind weaving our trademark southern charm into every corner of the guest experience to make sure that guests feel so connected to the local area and so refreshed by its culture that they’ll soon forget where the city ends and the hotel walls begin at the end of the day our guests are like our family – and we treat them as such  our ultimate goal is to turn moments into lasting memories that will keep guests coming back time and time again and it’s our belief that happy guests lead to happy shareholders sotherly foundation the sotherly foundation is the community outreach arm of sotherly hotels we created the foundation in  because we wanted to take a more handson approach to making a difference in the communities surrounding our hotels one family at a time each year the sotherly foundation will provide significant aid to one or more american veterans living in the communities around its hotels instead of taking a onesizefitsall approach we work directly with the veteran and his or her family to find out what they need most and to determine a strategy for meeting that need in the most lasting and meaningful way possible all recipients are chosen by the sotherly foundation board of directors with assistance from qualified organizations like the united states marine corps wounded warrior regiment the majority of all funds raised comes from the hard work and caring dedication of the employees of our hotels although the foundation does accept donations from the general public as well as a c registered nonprofit all contributions to the sotherly foundation are taxdeductible for more information on the sotherly foundation visit our
