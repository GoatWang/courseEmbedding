first question user reviews clueless goes to harvard  december   by roland e zwick magneteachaolcom united states – see all my reviews in legally blonde  which could well be retitled clueless goes to harvard  the delightful reese witherspoon stars as a ditzy fashionobsessed airhead who winds up through plot complications too elaborate to go through taking that ivy league law school by storm needless to say there is not a single believable moment in the film but that is generally the case with most fishoutofwater scenarios anyway what legally blonde does have is a warm spirit a bubbly demeanor and a breezy charm that reflect to a tee the personality of its main characteralthough the film does not exhibit the same level of comic genius we found in clueless witherspoons letterperfect rendition of the bubblehead stereotype earns the film a great deal of audience goodwill a factor that helps us to get over some of the movies flatter moments for indeed throughout the course of this tale we do hit a number of arid stretches where we feel that we should be laughing an awful lot more than we are in fact legally blonde occasionally feels more like a concept in search of a movie than a fullfledged work in its own right but just as you are about to give up on it the filmmakers hit upon a hilarious concept sight gag or line of dialogue which help to set the movie back on trackclearly witherspoon is the big selling point of this film as an actress she exudes such an air of intelligence confidence and compassionate goodwill that she invests even her dumb blonde character with those seemingly paradoxical traits legally blonde isnt always at the top of its form but witherspoon wins the case for the film hands down anyway  of  people found this review helpful
