importance of trust in supply chain management   contact us sales assistance      infopsiplannercom importance of trust in supply chain management one of the most critical factors in a committed and collaborative relationship between supply chain partners is trust if trust is present it can improve the chances of a successful supply chain relationship if not transaction costs can rise through poor performance organizations need trust in order to be flexible and agile however establishing trust can be elusive and even harder to maintain it is also true that trust is both individual and institutional trust in a supply chain evolves based upon commonalities among the partners and can take patience and time to develop there is both risk and interdependence in a supply chain relationship and there must be an implicit agreement not to exploit the partner’s vulnerabilities this takes development honesty and openness to be successful in fact the main components in trust in supply chains are honesty loyalty fairness openness and competence companies must be careful to “optimize” this trust as it can take resources from other aspects of the supply chain and risks to develop this so they must be careful not to over or under invest in developing trust the value of the specific relationship must first be made clear so that it can be determined what effort will be put forth in developing this trust it is apparent that trust only exists when both parties think it exists that it is critical to treat supply chain partners like they are important information needs to be shared freely and that partners need to follow through with promises made lpa llc is a supply chain software and consulting business offering affordable easytoimplement solutions to complex

chain management software scms solutions are generally not single applications but rather suites of integrated applications and modules organized around a central platform presenting a rather wide breadth of features to meet the needs of larger enterprises scms is used to automate and—with inbuilt analytics—optimize the process of managing supply and demand ordering and procurement warehouse operations and distribution and the logistical processes and networks of these enterprises along with all the regulatory issues this may entail they are inventory management platforms with long arms so to speak including software for transportation  logistics omnichannel retail and optionally product lifecycle management and manufacturing also because successful product delivery depends upon collaboration with many verticalbound and fiercely competing supply partners scms presents vendor relationship and supply chain integrity management as well as pl or carrier management scm vs erp a familiar leaderboardit is unsurprising given the breadth scale and nature of scm application suites that the top software companies in this space are the erp vendors sap and oracle dominate the field raking in many hundreds of millions more in revenue than their nearest competitors with epicor and infor making respectable showings there are a few supply chain software specialists that are also quite popular—jda software group and manhattan associates notably one prominent vendor descartes systems group focuses on logistics offering route planning and their logistics network software with document management capabilities these features aim to reduce some of the complexity and headache inherent in managing a global supply chains customs and regulatory compliance problems and roadblocks components of supply chain management software suitesdemand management and supply responsiveness demand management one of the inwardlooking capabilities inherent in supply chain management is basically analysis of sales customer and order data to improve inventory control via forecasting key benefits include intelligent and responsive procurement and resupply better resource allocation and a reduction in costly oversupply of inventorydistribution transportation and logistics this outward looking element helps to optimize both cost and customer satisfaction and is of chief concern to enterprises with global supply chains or larger businesses with many disparate locations and warehouses and with many potential logistical partners and carriers to choose from the success of the external element of supply chain management depends on an agile network of partners and collaboration and global trade management leading scms supports  transportation management managing freight and carriers and logistics networks route optimization rate analysis and shipping performance for customer satisfaction warehouse management  inventory management also offered as standalone software for smbs retailers and ecommerceheavy businesses warehouse management software automates warehouse operations internally as the name implies but it is more than stocking items healthily and safely in neat boxes on climate controlled shelves this component also monitors and manages stock across warehouses and distribution networks to optimize order fulfillment while controlling costs for vast supply chains the process is inexorably logistical as well and it is an inherent component of all scms vendor management supply chain integrity and product lifecycle management global supply chains involve many product development and logistical partners leading scm software vendors appreciate the needs of global enterprises that sell complex products while maintaining strict industry standards eg pharmaceutical companies by including vendor management and product lifecycle oversight monitoring and vendor scoring or vendor chastening in the case of counterfeiters or substandard suppliers all of these capabilities are folded into the scm suite supply chain integrity basically automates the process of avoiding logistical roadblocks as

relationships what does it mean to trust  part i trust in supply chain relationships what does it mean to trust  part i published on nov   by rob handfield scrc one of the most misunderstood and ripe areas for research in the area of supply chain relationships is in the area of trust trust and its cousin collaboration seems to be the single most discussed element in making supply chains function effectively and efficiently one academic noted that “in both serious social thought and everyday discourse it is assumed that the meaning of trust and of its many apparent synonyms is so well known that it can be left undefined or to contextual implications” barber  hosmer op cit  this observation is corroborated by the evolution of trust in the fields of industrial economics organizational behavior marketing and organizational theory of all the elements critical to managing supply chains trust is one of the most commonly cited elements yet one of the most difficult to measure a comparison of the various definitions of trust across research disciplines shows that trust can be grouped into six conceptual paradigms shown in the table below  reliability – time and experience are critical elements in evaluating trust rossiter and pearch  deutsch  rotter  gambetta  fairholm  lorenz  zucker  lewis  gulati  good   competence – experience and wisdom displayed by partner ghoshal and bartlett  luhmann  butler  a goodwill openness – confidence you can share information or problems with the other party pennings and woiceshyn  granovetter  johnson georges  swap  ring and van de ven  b goodwill benevolence – accepted duty to protect the rights of your partner farris et al  hart et al  mayer et al…  barber  rempel  holmes  butler  hosmer   vulnerability – being unprotected or exposed while including an element of uncertainty or risk deutsch  akerlof  barney  hansen  klein crawford  alchian  zand  holmstrom  sabel  lorenz  gambetta   loyalty – a partner is not just reliable but performs well in extraordinary situations  rempel  holmes  larson  friedland   multiple forms of trust – there are more than one type of trust mcallister  mishra  gabarro  bromiley  cummings  rempel  holmes  ghoshal  bartlett  in paradigm one authors posit that trust is a cognitive predictability or reliability of another party the second paradigm addresses the competence of a party as a component of trust in the third paradigm a recognition of trust as an altruistic faith or goodwill felt toward another party is proposed the fourth paradigm relates the concept of vulnerability to trust paradigm number five specifies that loyaltybased trust exists when a partner consistently goes beyond the call of duty the sixth conceptual paradigm realizes that multiple components of trust exist which are defined by cognitive reliability or task trust and affective altruistic faith trust through this threepart series we will identify and discuss each of these representative paradigms that are drawn from the marketing organization theory sourcing and organization behavior literature streams reliability reliability can be broken down into several elements reliability is dependent on prior contact with a party or experience repeated interaction and time leads to levels of confidence consistency and finally trust reliability then leads to predictability which is confidence in future actions while reliability is important what motivates reliability is often more important reliability must be based on integrity or honesty to be effective reliability based coercion or stress eventually creates a suboptimal relationship or total breakdown a series of definitions define trust in terms of a firm or person’s reliability or expectation of performance deutsch  created one of the first definitions of trust which accepted the extreme position that for trust to be present expected loss must be greater than expected gain authors after deutsch extended trust as an expectation to include situations where expected gain are greater than loss reliability can often be confused with predictability reliability primarily addresses a party’s past behavior while predictability actually takes past behavior and other information to address probabilities of future performance reliability and predictability are closely related terms and definitions addressing either term fall into this body of theory firms or people who meet a threshold level of predictability can by definition be trusted this paradigm is best described by the following definition trust is a range of observable behaviors and a cognitive state that encompasses predictability rossiter and pearch  what this means in simple terms is that trust is not something that occurs overnight but is built up over time through repeated interactions and acts of good faith for example a longterm customer relationship may be based on a continuous discussion of problems that occur and are resolved over time i recall at a meeting between a senior vp of purchasing and a senior vp of marketing from two companies with a ten year history of a solid business relationship the vp of marketing noted that the reason the relationship worked is that “whenever there was a problem or conflict i was able to march over to his office shut the door lay it out on the table and work it out sometimes it took a few hours but when i came out we both felt better about the situation” categories scm featureshot topics read the supply chain management professional newsletter read the latest supply chain research articles and

article was updated on nov   to reflect changes in supply chain management technologywhat is supply chain managementsupply chain management scm is the combination of art and science that goes into improving the way your company finds the raw components it needs to make a product or service and deliver it to customers the following are five basic components of scm plan—this is the strategic portion of scm companies need a strategy for managing all the resources that go toward meeting customer demand for their product or service a big piece of scm planning is developing a set of metrics to monitor the supply chain so that it is efficient costs less and delivers high quality and value to customers  source—next companies must choose suppliers to deliver the goods and services they need to create their product therefore supply chain managers must develop a set of pricing delivery and payment processes with suppliers and create metrics for monitoring and improving the relationships and then scm managers can put together processes for managing their goods and services inventory including receiving and verifying shipments transferring them to the manufacturing facilities and authorizing supplier payments make—this is the manufacturing step supply chain managers schedule the activities necessary for production testing packaging and preparation for delivery this is the most metricintensive portion of the supply chain—one where companies are able to measure quality levels production output and worker productivity deliver—this is the part that many scm insiders refer to as logistics where companies coordinate the receipt of orders from customers develop a network of warehouses pick carriers to get products to customers and set up an invoicing system to receive payments return—this can be a problematic part of the supply chain for many companies supply chain planners have to create a responsive and flexible network for receiving defective and excess products back from their customers and supporting customers who have problems with delivered products for a more detailed outline of these steps check out the nonprofit supplychain councils websitewhat does supply chain management software dosupply chain management software is possibly the most fractured group of software applications on the planet each of the five major supply chain steps previously outlined is comprised of dozens of specific tasks many of which have their own specific software some vendors have assembled many of these different chunks of software together under a single roof but no one has a complete package that is right for every company for example most companies need to track demand supply manufacturing status logistics ie where things are in the supply chain and distribution they also need to share data with supply chain partners at an ever increasing rate while products from large erp vendors like saps advanced planner and optimizer apo can perform many or all of these tasks because each industrys supply chain has a unique set of challenges many companies decide to go with targeted best of breed products instead even if some integration is an inevitable consequenceits worth mentioning that the old adage about systems only being as good as the information that they contain applies doubly to scm if the information entered into a demand forecasting application is not accurate then you will get an inaccurate forecast similarly if employees bypass the supply chain systems and try to manage things manually using the fax machine or spreadsheets then even the most expensive systems will provide an incomplete picture of what is happening in a companys supply chainwhat is the relationship between erp crm and scmmany scm applications are reliant upon the kind of information that is stored inside enterprise resource planning erp software and in some cases to some customer relationship management crm packages theoretically a company could assemble the information it needs to feed the scm applications from legacy systems for most companies this means excel spreadsheets spread out all over the place but it can be nightmarish to try to get that information flowing on a fast reliable basis from all the areas of the company erp is the battering ram that integrates all that information in a single application and scm applications benefit from having a single major source to go to for uptodate information most cios who have tried to install scm applications say they are glad they did erp first they call the erp projects putting your information house in order of course erp is expensive and difficult so you may want to explore ways to feed your scm applications the information they need without doing erp first these days most erp vendors have scm modules so doing an erp project may be a way to kill two birds with one stone in addition the rise and importance of crm systems inside companies today puts even more pressure on a company to integrate all of its enterprisewide software packages companies will need to decide if these products meet their needs or if they need a more specialized systemapplications that simply automate the logistics aspects of scm are less dependent upon gathering information from around the company so they tend to be independent of the erp decision but chances are companies will need to have these applications communicate with erp in some fashion its important to pay attention to the softwares ability to integrate with the internet and with erp applications because the internet will drive demand for integrated information for example if a company wants to build a private website for communicating with their customers and suppliers the company will want to pull information from erp and supply chain applications together to present updated information about orders payments manufacturing status and deliverywhat is the goal of installing supply chain management softwarebefore the internet came along the aspirations of supply chain software devotees were limited to improving their ability to predict demand from customers and make their own supply chains run more smoothly but the cheap ubiquitous nature of the internet along with its simple universally accepted communication standards have thrown things wide open now companies can connect their supply chain with the supply chains of their suppliers and customers together in a single vast network that optimizes costs and opportunities for everyone involved this was the reason for the bb explosion the idea that everyone a company does business with could be connected together into one big happy cooperative familyof course reality isnt quite that happy and cooperative but today most companies share at least some data with their supply chain partners the goal of these projects is greater supply chain visibility the supply chain in most industries is like a big card game the players dont want to show their cards because they dont trust anyone else with the information but if they showed their hands they could all benefit suppliers wouldnt have to guess how many raw materials to order and manufacturers wouldnt have to order more than they need from suppliers to make sure they have enough on hand if demand for their products unexpectedly increases and retailers would have fewer empty shelves if they shared the information they had about sales of a manufacturers product in all their stores with the manufacturer the internet makes showing your hand to others possible but centuries of distrust and lack of coordination within industries make it difficultduring the last few years most companies have gotten over the trust issue in many cases gotten over is a euphemism for have been bullied into sharing supply chain information from a dominant industry player want to sell your goods in walmart better be prepared to share data and adhere to walmarts dataexchange standards for more on this topic see how walmart lost its technology edgethe payoff of timely and accurate supply chain information is the ability to make or ship only as much of a product as there is a market for this is the practice known as justintime manufacturing and it allows companies to reduce the amount of inventory that they keep this can cut costs substantially since you no longer need to pay to produce and store excess goods but many companies and their supply chain partners have a long way to go before that level of supply chain flexibility can be achievedwhat is supply chain collaborationlets look at consumerpackaged goods for an example of collaboration if there are two companies that have made supply chain a household word they are walmart and procter  gamble before these two companies started collaborating back in the s retailers shared very little information with manufacturers but then the two giants built a software system that hooked pg up to walmarts distribution centers when pgs products run low at the distribution centers the system sends an automatic alert to pg to ship more in some cases the system communicates down to the individual walmart store allowing pg monitor the shelves through realtime satellite linkups that send messages to the factory whenever a pg item swoops past a scanner at the register within the last couple of years the relationship has expanded to include radiofrequency identification rfid technologies to gain even more insight into ridding inefficiencies in the supply chainwith this kind of minutetominute information pg knows when to make ship and display more products at the walmart stores theres no need to keep products piled up in warehouses awaiting walmarts call invoicing and payments happen automatically too the system saves pg so much in time reduced inventory and lower orderprocessing costs that it can afford to give walmart low everyday prices without putting itself out of business for more on walmarts supply chain see how walmart lost its technology edgewhat are the roadblocks to installing supply chain softwaregaining trust from your suppliers and partnerssupply chain automation is uniquely difficult because its complexity extends beyond a companys walls employees will need to change the way they work and so will the people from each supplier that a company adds to its network only the largest and most powerful manufacturers or retailers ie walmart can force such radical changes down suppliers and partners throats most companies have to sell outsiders on the system moreover one companys goals in installing the system may be threatening to their suppliers to say the least for example walmarts collaboration with pg meant that pg would assume more responsibility for inventory management something retailers have traditionally done on their own walmart had the clout to demand this from pg but it also gave pg something in return—better information about walmarts product demand which helped pg manufacture its products more efficiently in order for a company to get its supply chain partners to agree to collaborate business leaders and supplier relations managers have to be willing to compromise and help partners achieve their own goalsinternal resistance to changeif selling supply chain systems is difficult on the outside it isnt much easier inside operations people are accustomed to dealing with phone calls faxes spreadsheets or hunches scrawled on paper and will most likely want to keep it that way if management cant convince frontline operations people that using the software will be worth their time they will easily find ways to work around it senior executives cannot disconnect the telephones and fax machines just because they have supply chain software in
