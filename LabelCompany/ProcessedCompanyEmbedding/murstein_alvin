and career  personal  references  external links early life and careeredit andrew mead murstein was born in roslyn new york to alvin and aileen murstein his grandfather of german descent leon murstein came to the united states from argentina became a new york cabdriver and purchased one of the first new york taxi medallions issued in  for  the family went on to purchase several hundred medallions for prices as little as  each—medallions peaked at over  each and currently sell for around  each murstein reportedly sold the majority of his medallions in  and  before uber and lyft affected the taxi medallion values a claim that has not been independently verified a subsidiary of medallion financial currently owns  chicago medallions it values at  each or approximately  million but owes more than  million on them the subsidiary is currently being sued in a new york court for failing to repay a loan on the chicago medallions murstein’s introduction to the taxicab industry came early his father employed by his grandfather in his queensbased taxi business used to take young andrew along to the taxi garage where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late today murstein does not travel by taxi instead relying on a private driver paid for by medallion financial since  andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than  medallions when they decided to sell some in the s no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky they did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion medallion has since lent over  billion to the taxi industry but has chargedoff at least  million in medallion loans in  aloneaccording to regulatory filings regulators required medallion bank to take additional loan loss reserves for the quarter ended september   after a recent examination after increasing reserves medallion bank was undercapitalized in  the mursteins founded a familyowned company called medallion funding corp to build a taxi medallion lending business medallion funding earned returns on investment over  percent per year more recently medallion funding corp and its subsidiaries were sued in a new york court for failure to repay  million borrowed to finance chicago medallions that are currently underwater as recently as march  senior notes issued by medallion financial traded for just  of par value a level that is indicative of severe financial distress later life and careeredit andrew murstein after completing his studies at tufts university and new york university spent several years on wall street including a stop at salomon brothers where he learned the power of equity in funding a business he joined medallion funding fulltime in  and eventually took the company public in  murstein successfully launched medallion financial corp established to be the parent company of medallion funding as a public company trading on the nasdaq under the symbol mfin the company has financed the purchase of thousands more in newark cambridge philadelphia chicago boston and new york city is an established industry leader but taxi loans are only a part of the story the company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners convenience stores manufacturers distributors and later public companies in  murstein invested million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis the subsidiary eventually named medallion taxi media was enhanced in  with the acquisition of see level advertising murstein sold medallion taxi media to clear channel yielding  million in  about this time medallion financial corp set up its own bank medallion bank to fund many of the company’s endeavors due to aggressive lending and outsize losses the bank accepted tarp money in  the banks loan losses in  were worse than  of banks in its peer group according to the ffiec in  it accepted an investment from the us treasury a security it has yet to repay the bank currently pays a  aftertax dividend on this preferred security in  murstein with former baseball star hank aaron and former new york governor mario cuomo both medallion financial board members and former football star and congressman jack kemp now deceased formed a specialpurpose acquisition company spac which raised million to buy a professional sports team the spac reportedly bid for the chicago cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance later that same year murstein organized and filed publicly a spac focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included former fbi director louis freeh and initial head of homeland security and former pennsylvania governor tom ridge on november   medallion financial corp as part of an investment group which includes richard petty and douglas g bergeron signed and closed sale on racing assets of one of nascars great names richard petty motorsports medallion is the largest owner of the team in  along with partners richard mack and nfl legend jim brown murstein acquired the long island lizards of major league lacrosse and renamed the team the new york lizards the team plays at hofstra university on long island and won the mll championship for the third time in the financial success of richard petty motorsports is unknown the company does not pay cash interest to medallion financial opting to roll interest into the balance due murstein publicly stated that medallion may sell part of its motorsports stake in october  but by december  richard petty motorsports made the decision to downsize to one car from two for the next racing season under murstein’s leadership medallion today manages over  billion of investments the company has paid out over  in dividends to its shareholders since going public but suspended dividends in  due to losses from declining taxi medallion values in  murstein told barrons that the chances of such a dividend cut were slim to none since the article was published dividends have been cut twice the latest cut from  to per share to zero personaledit murstein is married to barbara lynn rudnick they have two children kimberly and matthew and live in new york city murstein an avid sports fan can frequently be seen at his table at the very exclusive raos restaurant where he frequently dines with academy award winner leonardo dicaprio and hank aaron or in the front row at madison square garden and yankee stadium often with other bold faced names murstein also reportedly threw his son an epic bar mitzvah reception in  with guests that included governor andrew cuomo hank aaron and a special hourlong performance
