source morningstar® the style box reveals a funds investment style for credit quality of the bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration average effective duration

sales charges placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the

rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent year period actually has the greatest impact

measured by a stated index by definition the beta of the stated index is  a fund with a higher beta has been more volatile than the index and a fund with a lower beta has been less volatile than the index sharpe ratio the sharpe ratio developed by nobel prize winner william sharpe provides a measure of a funds historical riskadjusted performance a higher number indicates better historical

rsquared of  would mean that the fund is tracking its benchmark exactly a low rsquared indicates that very few of the funds movements are explained by movements of its benchmark rsquared can help determine the significance of the funds beta a higher rsquared generally indicates a more useful beta lower rsquared means the funds beta is less relevant to its performance standard deviation this
