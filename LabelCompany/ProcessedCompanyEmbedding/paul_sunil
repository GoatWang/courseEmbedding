all cash deal for nris spasm company sunil paul founder  ceo brightmail inc born in punjab spasm guru   may   early this week computer security firm symantec scooped up brightmail inc for a hefty  million in an all cash deal just when it was about to go public industry experts say the symantecbrightmail deal coming alongside the google ipo points to a revival in the tech industry in  when pauls wife michelle began complaining about the appearance of spam junk mail in her america online email account sunil decided to create a way for users to control their email brightmail inc dedicated to giving users control of their email prior to starting brightmail sunil created freeloader inc the first company to offer a webbased push service in  individual inc acquired freeloader for  million making it the best and secondbest performing investments in the vc portfolios of euclid and softbank respectively before launching freeloader sunil was with america online aol as that companys first internet product manager successfully creating most of aols internet capabilities before aol sunil was a policy analyst at the us congress office of technology assessment where he specialized in information technology and telecommunications including the thenemerging internet prior to that sunil spent three years working on nasfreeloader specialized in a product designed to push information at you  it was a program that downloaded content from the net while you werent at your computer brightmail ironically aims to do the exact opposite brightmails mandate is to fight spam  to keep information you dont want from getting into your computer by filtering it out of daily mail traffic pauls transition from push to antipush is a neat little metaphor for how our relationship to the internet has changed over the past few years but thats not the only reason we should pay attention to him internet startup entrepreneurs are a dime a dozen these days and many of them come off as fairly wet behind the ears fresh from posh business schools where they seem to have excelled mainly in courses that could have been titled how to pitch vaporware to a venture capitalist or six easy ways to convince the press to cover your company paul is young still only  years old but already he has a track record of involvement with the commercialization of the net that few others can matchas space station information system sunil has a be in electrical engineering from vanderbilt university brightmails software uses filters and other proprietary technologies to block spam at the customers internet gateway the point at which internet traffic enters the public network the times are especially good for companies dealing with computer security and spam recent estimates say about  per cent of all email sent last year was spam up from only  per cent when pauls wife first began complaining about it brightmail inc biography born in punjab paul was four when his family migrated to america in   he spent his early childhood in nashville tennessee in  he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from vanderbilt university nashville buoyed by the news of the american space program he moved to washington to work at nasa but the experience was not very rewarding i regretted taking up the job with nasa because i expected to do more engineering work but ended up doing operational and maintenance work he says from there the restless paul moved to a consulting firm that worked for nasa and then joined a congressional agency that gave advice on different policy options   the nemesis of junk mail shanthi shankarkumar of course spam  or junk email  is a waste of time and money and the most that most of us do is slowly destroy the delete key in annoyance and among the freshest of solutions in the market is sunil pauls brightmailcom brightmail inc has advanced email services and software to enhance the quality and utility of email but its initial product the brightmail antispam service fights unsolicited commercial email sunil pauls antispam program launched in october  covers nearly  million email accounts provided by its  partners brightmail has formed technology and distribution partnerships with netscape sendmail and softwarecom other partners include att worldnet service concentric network earthlink excite fastnet flashnet juno online services and usanet brightmail runs a hour operation center where it identifies new and existing spam and then forwards information about the spam to a spam wall assigned to each user the spam wall uses software to identify and block spam messages before they reach a users inbox paul says almost  per cent of email users say they get spammed six or more times a week according to a recent study of  email users commissioned by bright light and conducted by the gartner group users want their isps to protect them from spam the study found paul chief executive officer of bright mail was inspired to develop a better solution to the spam problem because his personal email accounts were overrun by spam what makes brightmail effective the biggest difference is that it works there are a number of approaches out there that are able to stop  to  per cent of spam and some proprietary approaches that stop up to  per cent but nobody else can match us for both effectiveness and accuracy the big difference is that we have got people and technology says paul the fact that the spam filtering is done at the isp levels rather than the user level makes the brightmail service unique so how does it work we basically set up large numbers of email addresses all over the net those addresses are set up to receive spam and only spam those addresses are forwarded to an operational center and there we have people develop new techniques to stop any new spam attack those techniques or rules are sent out to our customers spam is sent to a temporary holding area where it is automatically deleted after a while he says the world of policy warts and engineering geeks appealed to me he says laughing the internet was a young domain then and paul would spend evenings after work exploring it he eventually convinced the agency to have a web browser put on every desktop  those were the days when mosaic was the only web browser available the world of government was too slowpaced for this man who liked to leap his way through life after three years i realized i was not cut out for the government i needed to get things done quickly and feel the impact of what i was doing and not have to wait years to make a difference he says he then joined aol where as an internet product manager he was responsible for introducing internet services to aol aols size made him worry if he could make the impact he was looking for but he need not have worried i definitely made a significant impact and helped contribute to aols internet strategy he says but a year later he was ready to enter a new phase in his work life he had a burning desire to be an entrepreneur and so joined up with a friend to start a pioneering push media company freeloader paul has no regrets about leaving aol i needed to have greater control over my destiny it was as much an emotional decision as a financial one in fact on a financial level one might have done well just staying on he says paul says he not only learned about the internet at aol but also the companys insane focus on the customer he says he is amazed that no other isp have been able to replicate this singleminded focus on the customer they used to call it steves phenomenon every time anybody came up with a new idea theyd ask would steves mom be able to use it and if the answer is no then the idea died says paul with an admiring chuckle steve of course being steve case aols ceo of course paul also realized that he likes being the boss i dont want to work for someone he said  i have great faith in my ability prior to starting brightmail sunil created freeloader inc the first company to offer a webbased push service in  individual inc acquired freeloader for   million making it the best and secondbest performing investments in the vc portfolios of euclid and softbank respectively less than a year later freeloader closed down but for paul there was no looking back the money made from the sale would eventually lead to the starting of brightmail which ironically keeps information away from your machine by filtering out spam from your mail the brightmail story has been celebrated in a number of magazine articles cnn too has run a feature on it but sunil paul feels he has taken just a handful of steps there are very significant announcements coming up we are going to roll out big customers he says we are also planning to go into antivirus and other products that will make email an indispensable tool money is not really the motivating force the real motivator is making a significant contribution to the world before i leave it i see a lot of things that can be improved the problems getting bigger sunil paul spam is costing the industry tens of millions of dollars a month in bandwidth customer service and systems administration between  to  per cent of the average  million e mail messages that america online gets daily is spam most large internet service providers have four to six people dedicated to combating the problem uce unsolicited commercial email or spam costs these companies roughly   million each month which works out to    per subscriber a onemillionperson isp will typically lose about   million a year because of spam it is the odd economics of the internet that created the junk email problem unlike a piece of paper mail which costs  cents to a dollar to send there is no permessage charge to send email it is included in your monthly fee all a spammer needs to send out a million messages is a dialup internet account a million email addresses and a computer this is a problem thats only getting worse said paul who launched brightmail in july  to fight spam a survey has also found that the amount of spam increases the longer you have an account with an isp in the past the best way to protect yourself from being spammed was to be very careful about disclosing your email address if you avoided putting your email address on a web page if you did not participate in online discussion groups or chat sessions you were pretty safe but hiding your email address is getting difficult by the day more and more spammers are sending email to any address they think is valid if the message gets through they are jubilant if it doesnt they dont care according to technology columnist simon garfinkel the real spam problem in the coming year will not be from flybynight operations and scam artists it will be from legitimate companies that view unsolicited bulk email as a way to market themselves more effectively another survey conducted earlier this year by chooseyourmailcom has shown that pornographers are responsible for  per cent of the spam on the internet today there were two particularly disturbing aspects of this kind of spam some of them were quite graphic in the description of content being offered while many were very vague using ambiguous and misleading text to disguise the true nature of solicitation just behind the sex sellers  per cent of spam hawks getrichquick and workfromhome schemes many of them illegal the remainder advertised different products and services and a small percentage illegally offered stock tips legislation and lawsuits dont deter spammers portals and isps have fought spam with mixed success aol won a lawsuit in  that prevented one spammer who offers striptease shows on the internet from soliciting aol members one of the frustrations is that it is increasingly difficult to track down spammers the federal trade commission estimates that  per cent of spam is fraudulent therefore  per cent is already illegal yet that has not stemmed the tide state laws are already in effect but they have not had any success in stopping the spammers unlike telephone fax and physical mail that have been regulated successfully by law and agreements email has managed to fall outside the jurisdiction of the law if a us law is passed it will not help spammers in india and belgium he said sunil paul ceo of brightmail explains what it takes to be a twotime winner in the internet economy             by andrew leonard in june  sunil paul and his partner mark pincus cleared  million from the sale of their pioneering push media company freeloader in a way it was a seminal internet moment  freeloader wasnt even a year old and had never generated a dime in profit but little details like that just didnt matter in the new economy of the net so what if the stock price of the new parent company soon plunged or if freeloader itself was closed down less than a year later for sunil paul a onetime internet product manager for america online the experience was fruitful  and a springboard for his second venture brightmail freeloader specialized in a product designed to push information at you  it was a program that downloaded content from the net while you werent at your computer brightmail ironically aims to do the exact opposite brightmails mandate is to fight spam  to keep information you dont want from getting into your computer by filtering it out of daily mail traffic pauls transition from push to antipush is a neat little metaphor for how our relationship to the internet has changed over the past few years but thats not the only reason we should pay attention to him internet startup entrepreneurs are a dime a dozen these days and many of them come off as fairly wet behind the ears fresh from posh business schools where they seem to have excelled mainly in courses that could have been titled how to pitch vaporware to a venture capitalist or six easy ways to convince the press to cover your company paul is young still only  years old but already he has a track record of involvement with the commercialization of the net that few others can match which is not to say that his patter isnt as slick as the next ceo business schooltrained or not paul started out as an electrical engineer but he speaks with the smooth confidence of someone who has honed his persuasive skills through countless moneyraising sessions and marketing campaigns if theres one theme that runs through both freeloader and brightmail its that pauls companies know how to get press the craze over push media may be long gone and nearly forgotten but its hard to imagine anything on the net that aggravates the general public more than email spam a company that fights the plague of junk email is an obvious marketers dream  sunil paul placed his second round of startup cash on what looks to be a pretty good horse last week he talked with salon technology about his experiences steering two companies through the fastmoving waters of the net your career over the last five years has captured every up and down in the internet economy whats it been like to be part of this thrill ride its definitely been a roller coaster everybody talks about how the internet bubble is going to burst but the truth is that it has already burst many times it all came tumbling down in the fall of  and also in the fall of  and even before that as far back as  when you were at aol the consensus of many people covering the internet was that aol was going to get wiped out by the net  that aol didnt get the net at all i was on the inside thinking the same thing  weve got to get our act together but we did  aol successfully incorporated the internet into what it was doing and made it a clean and easy experience certainly that was what i was advocating why did you leave aol i left because i had great ambition and desire to be an entrepreneur it was more of an emotional decision than it was a financial decision on the emotional criteria it was a huge success on the financial side it was probably a break even i would have done very well if id stayed there push media seems such ancient history these days can you give me a sense of how the competitive environment for an internet startup has changed since those early days the noise level has gone up a huge factor there are so many other companies out there that are doing internetrelated things  either existing companies that are waking up to the realities of the internet or just other startups it used to be when we started freeloader that everything from getting visibility in the press to getting visibility among prospective investors or employers was easy there just werent as many internet companies around thats maybe the downside but theres definitely some upside too everybody knows about the internet now you no longer have to educate people about what email is and what it can do thats a big advantage  the story has moved from being one that is kind of techiefocused to one that is a general consumer story or a general business story so for example in the case of spam we no longer have to pitch purely to the technical press the general consumer press is interested in the topic because its something that affects almost everyone when you started freeloader you and your partner fit the classic startup entrepreneur scenario you maxed out your credit cards worked out of your homes and so on whats it been like the second time around its been a hell of a lot easier you dont have to bang against the credit limits of your credit card anymore i think the big difference is the ability to hit the ground running  you dont have to worry about going into debt and you dont have to worry about immediately turning around and raising money i put several hundred thousand dollars into the company in the beginning and i still had a number of people join me early on who either worked without salary for a period of time for more equity in the company or at a reduced salary for a fairly long period of time for again more equity what that let me do was get the company further along before having to raise money  i was able to hold on to it for a little bit longer than i would have been able to otherwise are there specific lessons that you learned from freeloader that you applied to brightmail yes theres a technology lesson  deploying and maintaining client software software that is installed on individual users machines is really hard there is also a lesson in the desirability of finding a real problem a real need and satisfying it finding a need is a more straightforward job than inventing a need its a tricky balancing act though because theres always a little bit of creation of need involved at the same as you address a new problem you are creating new opportunities brightmail is out to do both  our initial products are aimed at solving a very obvious problem but future products will address the opportunities that we create by solving that problem can you talk more about those future products unfortunately were not really ready to talk right now about future products but they are all oriented toward improving email making email a more useful medium than it already is the overall strategy of the company is to introduce spam control and use that as a beginning for many other services in the same way as other companies like yahoo and netscape and amazon used their first very simple product  a directory a browser book sales  as a way to build up the market build a brand name build awareness and then layer other products on top of that you say that one of the things youve learned is that deploying client software is really difficult with brightmail you are primarily targeting internet service providers as customers for your software are isps a bigenough market for striking it rich in the spam business we know that spam is a real problem and it costs a lot of money for isps and corporations we estimate something like a billion dollars a year is lost due to spam a onemillionperson isp will typically lose about  million a year because of spam is that opportunity big yes is it capped yes also  but between here and that capped opportunity is a lot of revenue we see an opportunity to go grab a pretty reasonable healthy stake of revenue and create a core business big enough to build a lot of relationships and then leverage those relationships with your new products exactly one of your closest relationships is with sendmail the opensource software company right now your software is proprietary do you see any threat from the opensource software development model as far as brightmails prospects are concerned could the opensource community develop its own spamcontrol methods thats an interesting question it would take a massive coordination and while the internet helps coordination in an asynchronous mode its pretty hard to do in a synchronous mode part of the value that opensource software companies like red hat offer is that they add a layer of support on top of this asynchronous coordination of writing software similarly what we basically do is that kind of support we are the ones that are accountable were the ones that are writing the spamfiltering rules on a minutebyminute basis  and its expensive to run a  operation like ours it would be pretty difficult to do what we do in an opensource manner theres a saying in silicon valley these days that there is no shame in being involved in a failed startup  on the contrary ive heard it said that venture capitalists look favorably on entrepreneurs whove failed a few times  they are supposed to have learned from their mistakes and have a better idea of what it takes to succeed its hard to know whether to call freeloader a success or failure  you certainly picked up a nice chunk of change but the company itself was closed down and the product doesnt exist did that help you or hurt you the second time around is it true that failure looks good on a silicon valley résumé i dont know its true and its untrue ive heard people say that  but theres a difference to pay attention to did you try with gusto or did you just whimper along i see lots of companies and i interview people who just sort of puttered along and didnt really go for it and i dont think anybody respects that i guess if they end up being a big success people respect that but what people really like to see  and by people i mean investors and employees and people youre doing a joint effort with  is that you are willing to swing for the fences if you dont quite get there or if you struck out once before that isnt necessarily such a terrible sign   sunil paul – reinvent reinvent media innovators conversations series about team partnerships
