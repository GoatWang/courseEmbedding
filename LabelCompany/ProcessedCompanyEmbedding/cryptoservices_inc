identified by words like believe expect estimate anticipate intend project and similar expressions or words which by their nature refer to future events you should not place undue certainty on these forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements

related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceos compensation to median employee compensation in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the

august   shareholders of crypto services inc representing  of the companys issued stock approved changing the companys name from cryptoservices inc to fortune valley treasures inc the company filed a

will remain on the board as a director also effective december   the company announced the appointment of yumin lin to the board of directors in the position of president secretary and treasurer he will also serve as a director we have had limited operations and have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditor based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations plan of operation we are a development stage entity devoting substantially all of our efforts to establishing a new business for which our planned principal operations have not yet commenced we believe our current equity at risk is sufficient to finance our current activities our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended august  this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we launch our business platform there is no assurance we will ever reach this point accordingly we must raise cash from other sources our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others or loans from our shareholders or officers we have no assurances that such loans will become available upon acceptable terms when the funds are required for our operations results of operations our operating results for the three months ended november   and  are summarized in the table below three months ended november    revenue     general and administrative     net loss       revenues our revenue during the threemonth period ended november   and  was  operating expenses our operating expenses amounted to   during the threemonth period ended november   which comprised of general and administrative costs for the threemonth period ended november   our operation expenses amounted to  the decrease in the current period is due to the fact that we incurred less general and administrative costs capital resources and liquidity working capital november   august   current assets     current liabilities     working capital deficit       cash flows for the three months ended november   november   net cash used in operating activities       net cash used in investing activities     net cash provided by financing activities     net change in cash      net cash used in operations was  for the threemonths period ended november   compared to  for the period ended november   this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in general and administrative expenses of  for the threemonth period ended november   compared to that ended november   net cash used in investing activities was  for the period ended november   and the period ended november   cash flows provided by financing activities for the period ended november   were  compared to  for the period ended november   during the period ended november   the company borrowed  from its thenceo xinlong shen as of november   the company was indebted to xinlong shen in the amount of  which is noninterest bearing unsecured and due on demand we have substantial capital resource requirements and have incurred significant losses since inception as of november   we had  in cash based upon our current business plans we will need considerable cash investments to be successful such capital requirements are in excess of what we have in available cash and what we currently have commitment for therefore we do not have enough available cash to meet our obligations over the next twelve  months anticipated cash requirements we will require additional funds to fund our budgeted expenses over the next  months these funds may be raised through equity financing debt financing or other sources which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares we anticipate that our cash expenses over the next  months beginning november  will be approximately  as described in the table below these estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our business activities and our ability to raise capital from our shareholders or other sources description estimated expenses legal and accounting fees   marketing and advertising  investor relations and capital raising  management and operating costs  salaries and consulting fees  general and administrative expenses  total   our general and administrative expenses for the year will consist primarily of transfer agent fees bank and interest charges and general office expenses the professional fees are related to our regulatory filings throughout the year and include legal accounting and auditing fees based on our planned expenditures we will require approximately  to proceed with our business plan over the next  months as of november   we had  cash on hand if we secure less than the full amount of financing that we require we will not be able to carry out our complete business plan and we will be forced to proceed with a scaled back business plan based on our available financial resources we intend to raise the balance of our cash requirements for the next  months from private placements shareholder loans or possibly a registered public offering either selfunderwritten or through a brokerdealer if we are unsuccessful in raising enough money through such efforts we may review other financing possibilities such as bank loans at this time we do not have a commitment from any brokerdealer to provide us with financing there is no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us even though we plan to raise capital through equity or debt financing we believe that the latter may not be a viable alternative for funding our operations as we do not have sufficient tangible assets to secure any such financing we anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock however we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds from the sale of our common stock to finance our operations in the absence of such financing we may be forced to abandon our business plan going concern during the period ended november   the company had net operating loss the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders the ability of the company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the companys ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern offbalance sheet arrangements the company has no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the companys financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors the term offbalance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party under which the company has i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract derivative instrument or variable interest or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit liquidity or

displayed a technical chart contains six months worth of daily price activity with the open high low and close for each bar presented in a display box above the chart each data point can be viewed by moving your mouse through the chart the vertical bars below the chart represent volume and are colorcoded to indicate market activity for the day an up day where the price is greater than the previous price will show a green bar a down day where the price is less than the previous price will show a red bar when the price is unchanged compared to the previous price volume will show as a blue bar on futures charts the horizontal purple line above the volume bars represents open interest technical charts have the option to create spread charts  with the ability to choose from a number of common spreads such as corn  soybeans crush and wheat butterfly or allowing you to enter your own custom spread calculation supporting all futures equities index and forex symbols chart settings a chart form resides below the chart this is where you can change the symbol style time frame and other chart settings if you are logged in to your my barchart account you will also see a dropdown list for any chart templates youve previously saved simply select one from the list and the settings on the template will be applied to the current chart basic chart bar type  choose from ohlc bars candlesticks hollow candlesticks line or area volume on  displays or hides the volume for the symbol time frame  determines the period frequency and amount of data that will be displayed on the chart time period and startend dates for frequency choose from intraday daily weekly or monthly for commodity contracts you may also select a chart for the contract nearest futures contract or a continuation chart nearest futures and continuation charts commodity charts have three additional frequencies for daily weekly and monthly data contract nearest and continuation dailyweeklymonthly contract will plot prices for that specific contract dailyweeklymonthly nearest futures will use whatever contract was the nearest futures contract on the date of the given bar the price box at the top shows the contract that was used to build the corresponding bar dailyweeklymonthly continuation chart will always use the same month specified in the chart form to build the given bar the price box at the top shows the contract that was used in this case december or z  the information is backdated to the start of the period so on a minute chart information in the period dated  includes all trades between  and  inclusive a trade at  would be included within the next bar dated  a default time period is set based on your frequency setting for example an intraday chart will use a time period of  days while a daily chart uses a time period of  months you may change the time period to increase or decrease the density of the bars displayed on the chart the longer the time frame the closer together the individual bars the shorter the time frame the more distance between the bars you may override or further define the time period or generate a historical chart by entering a start and end date for the data for example you can get a daily chart with  months of data from one year ago by entering an end date from one year back display settings  further define what the chart will look like price box  when checked displays a data view window as you mouseover the chart showing ohlc for the bar and all indicator values for the given bar price scale  when on scale on the right of the chart shows prices  change scale  when on scale on the right of the chart shows the percent change from the open linear scale  when on scaling will calculate the most intelligent scale using the high the low and a series of acceptable divisors for possible scales logarithmic scale  when on uses logarithmic scaling instead of the linear scaling spread chart spread charts allow you to choose from a number of common commodity spread chart calculations you may also create your own custom spread chart by selecting up to three commodity contracts and multipliers or by entering your own custom spread expression the calculated results are displayed as a line chart expression shows the calculation used to create the chart when you select a common spread from the dropdown list or when you create a futures spread using the fields on the form the expression is built automatically for you if you want to create your own custom expression you can enter the calculation directly into the expression field valid syntax for an expression calculation includes the use of addition  subtraction  multiplication  and division  between each leg calculations are performed from left to right unless you change the order of the calculation using parentheses examples ibmdell subtracts the last price of dell from ibm ibmdell multiplies ibm by two then adds the price of dell dellibm multiplies dell by two then divides by three then adds ibm dellibm multiplies dell by two then divides the result by the sum of three plus ibm dxyspx subtracts the sp  index from the dollar index usdcadcadaud adds the canadian dollaraustralian dollar to the us dollarcanadian dollar note for futures contracts barcharts charting application commonly uses the  symbol on futures contracts as a shortcut to specify the month for example zc will return the front month zc returns the second month out zc returns the third month out etc when creating a custom expression using futures contracts you must use parentheses

certificate of amendment with the state of nevada on september   we have had limited operations and have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditor based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations plan of operation we are a development stage entity devoting substantially all of our efforts to establishing a new business for which our planned principal operations have not yet commenced we believe our current equity at risk is sufficient to finance our current activities our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended august  this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we launch our business platform there is no assurance we will ever reach this point accordingly we must raise cash from other sources our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others or loans from our shareholders or officers we have no assurances that such loans will become available upon acceptable terms when the funds are required for our operations results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k for the fiscal years ended august   and august   revenue for the years ended august   and  we generated no revenue operating expense operating expense decreased to  for the year ended august   as compared with  for the year ended august   this decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in general and administrative expenses due to accounting legal and consulting expenses net loss net loss decreased to  for the year ended august   as compared with  for the year ended august   the decrease is attributable to a decrease in operating expenses and gain on waive of liability of approximately  liquidity and capital resources for the years ended august    net cash used in operating activities       net cash used in investing activities     net cash provided by financing activities     net cash used in operations was  for the fiscal year ended august   compared to  for the year ended august   net cash used in investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended august   and for the year ended august   cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended august   were  compared to  for the year ended august   we have substantial capital resource requirements and have incurred significant losses since inception as of august   we had  in cash based upon our current business plans we will need considerable cash investments to be successful such capital requirements are in excess of what we have in available cash and what we currently have commitment for therefore we do not have enough available cash to meet our obligations over the next twelve  months related party transactions since inception we have conducted transactions with directors and director related entities these transactions included the following during the fiscal year of  the company was indebted to the prior president of the company in the amount of  which is noninterest bearing unsecured and due on demand on august   the former president gordon hum confirmed that there were no trade payables accrued expenses liabilities taxes obligations or commitments prior to august   which would be required to accrue or be reflected in in the financial statements additionally he confirmed that he has waived any and all such liabilities as of august   as of august   the company was indebted to the current ceo xinlong shen in the amount of  which is noninterest bearing unsecured and due on demand lily chen friend of xinlong shen provided noncompensated book keeping and financial reporting services from

of the companys assets and liabilities mr hum agreed to retire any and all shares of preferred stock of the company for return to treasury pursuant to the assignment of the assets and liabilities to gordon hum the company agreed to deliver to mr hum any documentary evidence of the full and unrestricted title to the assets and liabilities and such other documents as may be required under applicable law or reasonably requested by mr hum effective october   the company delivered to mr hum the required documentary evidence of the full and unrestricted title to the assets and liabilities

ended august   or the period ended august   and have incurred significant losses and cash used in operations and such losses and use of cash are expected to continue during the period ended august   the company has an accumulated deficit of  our independent registered public accounting firm has included a going concern qualification in their report for the year ended august   and the period from inception through august   in addition we have negative working capital the foregoing raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern managements plans include seeking additional capital or debt financing there is no guarantee that additional capital or debt financing will be available when and to the extent required or that if available it will be on terms acceptable to us the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty the going concern qualification might make it substantially more difficult to raise capital we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial
