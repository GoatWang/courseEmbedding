wacker drive in chicago one of the properties that are part of commonwealth reit a  billion real estate empire based outside boston credit nathan weber for the new york times it is a quiet american fortune a  billion empire stretching from boston to honolulu that is rarely noticed outside tight business circlesbut now the private world of barry portnoy the antitrump of american real estate is being dragged into an uncomfortable spotlight in a drawnout legal battle for part of his empiremr portnoy  oversees a wildly lucrative business from unassuming offices in newton mass west of downtown boston in an industry known for big money and bigger egos he cuts a decidedly unglamorous figure mr portnoy runs his empire on a shoestring and by most accounts is far more interested in making money than spending it for a time he commuted to work in a subaru according to several former employees and he keeps a low profile even at events like the annual company clambake in the parking lot advertisement continue reading the main story his son and business partner adam portnoy lives a bit larger adam portnoy’s wife elika was a runnerup in a miss bulgaria beauty contest said to be an expert marksman she played a belly dancer in the  christian slater thriller “assassin’s bullet” adam portnoy owns a foot yacht called the mutressa a bulgarian term that loosely translates as “gangster’s mistress” the couple met while working at the world bank continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story what unites father and son the former employees say is an abiding love for a hardnosed deal in their newton offices hangs a painting of wild west bank robbers wearing illfitting business suits it is titled “the fort worth five a k a the board of directors” photo the triangle plaza east tower near o’hare international airport in chicago credit nathan weber for the new york times for years some investors have grumbled that the portnoys have enriched themselves at investors’ expense a claim the portnoys have dismissed as nonsensebut now some serious financial players are vying for a multibilliondollar piece of their kingdom in a legal battle over an obscure real estate investment trust called commonwealth reit on one side are the portnoys who have long blurred the lines between their public companies and their private fiefs on the other is a cohort of new york money men among them a protégé of carl c icahn the quintessential wall street gadfly and associates of stephen ross the manhattan real estate magnate both sides are hurling an accusation often heard when money collides with money each accuses the other of baldface greedwhatever the outcome the imbroglio has trained attention on a web of trusts and partnerships that the portnoys have long used to pull many millions from commonwealth and other public entities that own city towers and suburban office complexes across the nation last year their private management company collected nearly  million in various fees and expenses from those businesses the portnoy camp says that the dissidents are essentially trying to steal commonwealth and that courts have repeatedly sided with the portnoys in late june the portnoys and the rest of the board were voted out but the portnoys contend that the vote was invalid and was swayed by their opponents’ hedge fund friends starting this week the dispute will go before an industry arbitration panela crucial issue is the portnoys’ management arrangement with the funds they oversee essentially they make money through numerous fees they charge no matter how commonwealth’s share price performs in the stock market leading one research firm green street advisors to brand the portnoy funds “uninvestible”over the last decade commonwealth has returned about  percent that performance might sounds great but it lagged the broad stock market and an index of other real estate investment trusts during that period real estate investment trusts a popular investment strategy pay no corporate income tax as long as they distribute  percent of their profits as dividends to investorsadam portnoy  staunchly defends the portnoy way he says the family has rewarded investors over the years and points out that commonwealth found ready buyers for new shares that it sold this spring photo the herald square building on h street in washington credit drew angerer for the new york times “if we hadn’t how would we be able to raise money so readily” mr portnoy said in a telephone interview “why are shareholders investing in our companies” advertisement continue reading the main story barry portnoy got into real estate in  while a lawyer at the boston firm of sullivan  worcester he established a real estate investment trust that was initially involved in health care centersformer employees including several who worked closely with the portnoys say barry portnoy spends long hours poring over numbers and they characterize him as demanding boss who can be unforgiving at regular tuesday night strategy meetings when adam portnoy joined the family firm in  after starting an internet service provider that

appeared to benefit the portnoys more than the shareholders but now bigger more powerful adversaries have arrivedjeff t blau the chief executive of related companies the real estate giant founded by mr ross is one of the new yorkers now battling the portnoys“maybe if we had known they’d go to such extremes to thwart the will of shareholders we would have thought twice about doing this” mr blau said during an interview in his office overlooking columbus circle in midtown manhattan the activist role against the portnoys has pushed related into new and uncomfortable territory photo the british school of washington on wisconsin avenue in washington credit drew angerer for the new york times mr blau and keith meister a former top lieutenant of mr icahn who now runs his own hedge fund invested heavily in commonwealth earlier this year the two said they believed the stock was undervalued contending that with some improvements the buildings could draw higher rents in late february related and mr meister’s firm corvex capital disclosed that they together controlled  percent of commonwealththe portnoys promptly began a vigorous defenseeventually the dissidents sought support from heavyweight investors like richard perry a prominent new york hedge fund manager they also started making multiple offers to buy commonwealth at abovemarket prices but the fund’s trustees decided against a sale calling the offers “illusory” unfinanced and an attempt to “seize control” “there was no offer” adam portnoy said “they wrote on a piece of paper that they might on a very conditional basis maybe they would pay a certain price that’s not an offer”mr blau shakes his head at that statement“it’s in writing and we sent it to the board” mr blau said advertisement continue reading the main story in late june corvex and related announced that  percent of commonwealth shareholders had voted to remove the entire board the portnoys said that the vote did not follow rules and that it was influenced by a group of shareholders — hedge fund pals of corvex and related — who have since sold their stake it now falls to an arbitration panel to decide“in all of my experience i’ve never seen a management team react with such disregard for corporate value and such personal selfinterest as a motivation” said mr meister of corvexbut the portnoys say they are on the side of everyday shareholders“everything we’ve always done has been in the best interest of shareholders” adam portnoy said “when we come in to work every day our focus is on the common shareholders and executing on the business plan and it’s starting to work but it needs a little more time to come to fruition” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think whats next loading go
