about unlocking phones such as when the device is paid off or the contract is fulfilled and verizon whose gsmcapable devices ship with the gsm portion already unlocked sprint will unlock devices for international use only for customers in good standing after contacting customer support this limitation means phones and tablets sold by sprint which were launched prior to february   will only lawfully function on the sprint network a policy that prevents what may otherwise be compatibility with another carriers network additionally the resale value of sprintsold iphones generally are the lowest of devices sold by the top four carriers in the country means to unlock a gsmcapable iphone exist such as using a sim interposer but the device may not function fully or correctly on the

to connect through it but it could be reconfigured to accept only connections from up to  authorized numbers in order to eliminate unwanted use it should be noted that the airrave uses the customers own bandwidth to connect calls—potentially slowing internet speeds on less ample connections and causing the customer to essentially subsidize the sprint network that being said sprint is one of the only carriers that historically has not charged its customers for this type of device if the customer can demonstrate that sprint coverage is inadequate where they live airave nowwhen has a device
