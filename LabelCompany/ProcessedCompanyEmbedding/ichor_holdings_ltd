fluid delivery services and equipment to a range of semiconductor manufacturing industriesthe proposed valuation appears reasonable and management is growing revenues and gross margin while generating cash flowmy opinion is to buy the ipo in the proposed range of    per share quick take ichor holdings nasdaqichr intends to sell  million shares at a midpoint of  per share in an ipo for expected gross proceeds of  million the company has been growing revenues and gross margin while generating cash flow while its capital efficient approach may be tested by the need to keep up with evershrinking semiconductor demands im positive on the ipo based on its proposed valuation and prospects company fremont californiabased ichor holdings was founded in  and reincorporated in the cayman islands in  in connection with its acquisition by private equity firm francisco partners it provides fluid delivery subsystems and turnkey process equipment for the semiconductor ledoled alternative energy data storage and flat panel display manufacturing markets the company is headed by chairman and ceo tom rohrs who was previously an executive at hewlett packard nysehpe and silicon graphics nasdaqsgi as well as an executive committee member of applied materials nasdaqamat from  to  technology ichor is focused on providing fluid delivery subsystems to oems producing many types of semiconductors fluid delivery entails gas and chemical delivery monitoring and control of precise amounts of gasses used to etch and deposit chemicals in various semiconductor manufacturing processes the company also manufactures components used for fluid delivery systems and sells those components to customers so ichor has both a service business and a components replacement business since many oems outsource these processes because they dont have the expertise to design and produce the kind of results required for very high precision processes market and competition according to a  report by gartner the worldwide semiconductor capital spending and equipment spending for waferlevel manufacturing equipment which is the segment that ichor operates in is expected to grow from  billion in  to  billion in  a total growth of  during the fouryear period source gartner  competitors for ichor include the following firms diversified fluid solutions mega fluid systems talon innovations gce group silpac ultra clean holdings matheson gas watlow applied energy systems ichor says it has competitive advantages because it aims to engage early with customers during the product development stage it also has longstanding relationships with top tier reference oems including lam research and applied materials which together contributed the most to its fy  sales financials ichors recent financial results can be summarized as follows increasing revenue growth rates uneven gross margin but trending upward uneven cffo but positive for the last three reporting periods below are the companys operational results for the past two and ¾ years audited gaap for full years source ichor s filing revenue to q   million  increase vs prior   million  increase vs prior   million gross margin to q       cash flow from operations to q   million   million   million as of september   the company had  million in cash unaudited and total current assets of  million total liabilities were  million ipo details ichor intends to raise gross proceeds of  million net proceeds of  million by selling  million shares at a midpoint price of  per share this share sale will represent  of total outstanding ordinary shares after the offering of  million shares for a proposed company market capitalization of  million the company says it will use the ipo proceeds to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes as follows we expect to use approximately  million of the net proceeds of this offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities of which approximately  million is expected be used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility and approximately  million is expected be used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility the remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes which we expect to include funding working capital operating expenses and the selective pursuit of business development opportunities in our focus segment areas note part of the debt was incurred to declare a onetime dividend of  million in august  to its privateequity shareholder francisco partners this type of transaction is not uncommon for private equityowned companies deutsche bank securities is the lead left underwriter for the ipo which includes stifel rbc capital markets cowen and company and needham  company the underwriters have the option to purchase up to  additional shares from majority shareholder francisco partners commentary assuming it ipos at the midpoint of  per share ichor aims to value itself at a pricesales multiple of x considering recent valuations for semiconductor equipment firms have been up to x ichors proposed price appears enticing the companys financials are a bit uneven but revenues and gross margins are growing or trending upward and ichor is cash flow positive a concern is the concentration of capital equipment manufacturers that ichor sells to only two customers lam research and applied materials accounted for a majority of ichors revenues indicating significant concentration in response ichor says it provides a range of products to its customers a total of  product lines in  unique manufacturing steps which serves to lessen potential exposure to major customer changes ichor also says it has a capital efficient model that requires minimum capital outlay thats all well and good but the company may be resting on its technology laurels technology moves forward and in the highly competitive semiconductor industry companies like ichor cannot avoid capital expenditures to keep their systems competitive especially as semiconductor wafers drop in size and increase in density and complexity interestingly on market size gartner predicts a slight drop in  vs  so the industry is cyclical and not immune to down cycles with these factors in mind im still bullish on ichors prospects company leadership has managed its growth well increasing revenues and gross margins at the same time while continuing to generate cash flow from operations my opinion is to buy the ipo at the proposed midpoint price of  per share based on reasonable valuation solid management and a medium term
