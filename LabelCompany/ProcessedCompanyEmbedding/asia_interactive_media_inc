resale of the securities offered through this prospectus by the selling security holders in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities with business objectives similar to ours there are many blank check companies seeking to carry out a business plan similar to ours that have completed initial public offerings in the united states furthermore there are a number of additional blank check companies in the registration process that have not yet completed initial public offerings and there are likely to be more blank check companies that have completed initial public offerings before we are able to successfully consummate a business combination we may also be subject to competition from entities other than blank check companies which may be special acquisition companies or capital pool companies that have a business objective similar to ours including venture capital firms leverage buyout firms and operating businesses looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target business many of these entities are wellestablished and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations either directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources may be relatively limited in comparison to many of these competitors while we believe that numerous potential target businesses may be available for acquisition our ability to acquire a certain attractive target business will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent competitive limitation may give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business the fact that stockholder approval may delay the completion of a business combination as well as the potential dilution represented by our outstanding warrants are additional limitations that may be viewed unfavorably by certain target businesses any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and our access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms over privatelyheld entities with business objectives similar to ours additionally our management has significant business experience and well developed contacts in various business industries in china and canada if we succeed in effecting a business combination there will likely be further intense competition from competitors of the target business we cannot assure you that subsequent to a business combination we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively company description we are a blank check company organized under the laws of the state of nevada on february   we currently maintain a mailing address at level  bank of china tower  garden road hong kong and our telephone number is  we do not have any subsidiaries our fiscal year end is december  we were formed for the purpose of merging with engaging in a capital stock exchange with purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more operating businesses we do not have any specific business combination under consideration and we have not identified any prospective target business nor has anyone done so on our behalf there is no assurance as to whether any business combination will be feasible at all or will be feasible on terms acceptable to us and we have no way of forecasting whether any proposed business combination will be successfully completed on a timely basis there is no assurance that we will successfully identify any potential target business enter into any definitive agreements with any potential target business or finally consummate a business combination with any potential target business we cannot assure you as to when or if a business combination will occur if we are not able to complete a business combination with a target business as planned and eventually produce enough revenues you could lose all or part of your investment in our stock if we issue debt or equity securities in order to consummate a business combination our stockholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company as there is no requirement that our stockholders own a certain percentage of our company after a business combination the issuance of any debt or equity securities would increase the amount of our outstanding shares and thus result in a dilution to our existing stockholders our management may decide that it is in our company’s best interest to acquire several target businesses with multiple acquisitions we could face additional risks including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations products and management of the acquired companies our current management has experience in business development capital raising and the marketing and management of various companies but has limited experience in operating a blank check company our business plan may fail due to our management’s lack of experience in this area and there is no current basis for you to evaluate our management’s experience in a particular industry in which we may ultimately operate we believe that the earliest we will begin generating revenues will not be until after the completion of a business combination however even if a business combination is successfully completed we may not be able to achieve our anticipated business goals gain any operating benefits or generate any profits we will be dependent on future financings in order to maintain our operations and carry out our business plan for the next twelve months beginning november  we plan to spend approximately  on consummating a business combination and funding operations of the target business and on general operations we do not currently have sufficient financing to fully carry out our business plan and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to do so accordingly there is uncertainty about our ability to continue our operations if we cease our operations you may lose your entire investment in our stock  asia interactive media inc
