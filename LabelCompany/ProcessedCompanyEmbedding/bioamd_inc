prothrombin timeinternational normalized ratio “ptinr” monitoring system development project earlier this year the company has actively sought a new suitable partner to continue the development of its coag technology coag is aimed at patients using warfarin based oral anticoagulants to enable them to more easily manage their medication dosage and coagulation within a safe therapeutic range we continue to believe that our clinically verified coag test strip based on a direct mechanical rather than electrochemical measurement of clotting time is best in class electrochemical devices are inherently susceptive to confounding factors such as other medical conditions which have caused fatal measurement inaccuracies the us food and drug administration is very much alive to these issues and has proposed tightened accuracy guidelines which the company believes it can easily meet with coag the current poc and selftest ptinr market projected to grow to around  billion pa in the next few years is currently dominated by a single company’s electrochemical based device in july of this year this dominance was amplified when the former  poc ptinr monitor also an electrochemical device was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its maker on fda advice following a fda investigation into accuracy concerns another planned device for selftest based on an electrochemical test strip supplied to a major for professional ptinr testing has recently been abandoned we believe that these developments reflect in some part the challenges of accuracy and fda requirements current and prospective our coag test strip has demonstrated that it can deliver market leading accuracy and reliability by a direct mechanical coagulation measurement even prior to optimization in a final device we believe that our coag strip is the ideal solution to current poc ptinr measurement accuracy issues the company has engaged with and has provided information to a number of interested parties active in poc and coagulation testing in its efforts to find a replacement development partner for coag discussions are ongoing mids project commences the company in partnership with a nanocap medical detection technology company has commenced the first stage of development of the company’s novel mids universal immunoassay device technology “mids project” this development is initially focussed on applying our patented mids technology into a rapidtest poc cardiac event detection device able to process high sensitivity hs troponin tests these hs tests can currently only be assayed on large expensive central laboratory equipment currently work is underway to confirm and demonstrate that the mids technology platform is accurate for the detection and quantitation of small quantities of magnetic nanoparticles such as those used in these hs tests electronics design is in progress to produce the printed circuit board suitable for bench testing and optimising the design of the highly sensitive bespoke hall effect sensors central to the magnetic detection of target nanoparticles the company believes there is a large potential market for highly accurate cardiac marker assays conducted by a hand held device at the point of care “poc” the mids project aim is to develop an easy to use handheld device which can achieve gold standard central laboratory accuracy or better at a fraction of the capital cost with results delivered at the poc within minutes about bioamd inc bioamd has two main majority owned uk subsidiaries bioamd uk holdings limited a technology developer for

delivery of healthcare is changing the demand for rapid diagnostic testing is becoming more prevalent the new global imperative is to speed up the diagnostic process tailoring it more effectively to individual patients and their circumstances testing at an earlier stage in the disease cycle for chronically sick patients offers clear potential to improve their quality of life by allowing self monitoring of their conditions at home or locally rather than requiring hospital visits in acute situations where speed of diagnosis is critical effective poc testing has a crucial role to play for example the possibility of running an accurate and precise troponin i assay in an ambulance on a potential heart attack patient may make a material difference to treatment and clinical outcome the factors driving this new approach create an opportunity for rapid diagnostic testing to play a more significant role in the patient care cycle there is clear demand for rapid intuitive easy to use robust handheld technologies that can safely take the testing environment to patients at a practical cost such platforms must deliver the level of sensitivity required for accurate measurements from the smallest possible sample and with the precision and accuracy of hospital laboratory systems the poc market is growing rapidly forecasters suggest  growth per annum over the next  years making the total market worth over  billion growth rates are driven by the wider adoption of poc technologies and new product launches improved accuracy and tests for a wider number of conditions will continue to see the selftest market develop rapidly a key opportunity is for improved poc product penetration in primary and secondary care settings effective and reliable poc technologies at the right price such as those developed and in development by bioamd can meet this need improving care saving costs and positively affecting clinical outcomes bioamd has positioned itself as a leading innovator in the field of reader technology development poc diagnosis requires the combination of two main fields of science  biochemistry designed to detect changes in body fluid chemistry and signal a medical condition and  electromechanical engineering required to create apparatus to measure those chemical changes there are three elements to the successful delivery of poc diagnosis  the biochemistry itself and  the medium that holds and combines the biochemistry with a body fluid sample and  the device reader that detects the changes in the biochemistry and communicates the result to the userpatient the most typical format for the detection medium is a ‘smart’ strip eg a lateral flow strip that allows diagnostics chemistry and extracted body fluid to mix and react in a predetermined way readers are typically designed to read the chemical changes on detection strips against this background the main trends in the poc market are the development of increasingly wide ranges of complex biochemical detectors and markers the increasing sophistication of smart strips to accommodate the innovations in biochemistry and the increasing sophistication of readers now regarded as alternatives and complements to complex laboratory equipment the first stage of our corporate strategy has been to develop a universal digital strip reader dsr capable of reading a variety of lateral flow strips to detect differing conditions we also have in an advanced stage development a blood coagulation monitor coag and a quantitative magnetic immunoassay detection system mids biad news  bioamd inc

together bioamd we or the company biad is pleased to announce that it has recently received an independent proof of market report report partfunded by a uk government grant on its novel magnetic immunoassay detection system mids technologywe believe that mids is capable of not only detecting but also counting at a nanoparticle level one or more different biomarkers concurrently in a single disposable multiplex test strip cartridge using a single fingerstick size blood sample mids detection of magnetic nanoparticles will allow fully quantitative measurement rapidly producing gold standard results in an easy to use format enhancing rapid screening possibilities the device should also offer significantly better sensitivity and accuracy compared to current methodsthe report which runs to over  pages primarily focusses on our initial product development target of cardiac marker testing for myocardial infarction mi heart attack the report was compiled in part by interview and questionnaires conducted amongst a relevant sample of medical experts and institutions in the uk germany and france respondents amongst other things the report indicates that a strong opportunity exists to service a gap in the market by the application of mids to cardiac marker testing as this would significantly accelerate the triage diagnosis treatment and disposition of patients presenting with mi symptoms  of respondents were likely to use a novel point of care immunoassay diagnostic platform like mids to detect or eliminate mi if it were available  of respondents agreed that a novel rapid more accurate point of care immunoassay such as mids is needed to detect or eliminate mi use of mids would result in accelerated triage diagnosis and treatment of mi and free up hospital resources where mi could be eliminated mids key usps of a rapid result time   minutes improved accuracy of detection and increased sensitivity achieved respondent attractiveness ratings of  or higher the cardiac biomarker market is predicted to reach bn pa by  with the cardiac point of care testing “poct” sector expected to grow fastest at  to bn by  the global market for poct generally valued at  billion in  is expected to increase to bn in  in the uk alone the introduction of mids for cardiac marker testing could potentially save the uk national health service around £million million per year mids also has a powerful opportunity to address other poct applications such as for venous thromboembolic sepsis and stroke conditions and for infectious disease and cancerthe company is very much encouraged by this independent validation and estimated quantification of the large potential market for mids based devices applied to cardiac markerstom barr ceo commented as our first technologies move towards market this report into the outlook for mids shows where additional value may be created there is a huge unmet demand for a product such as mids we believe we can deliver the huge

a uk intellectual property office patent application for a replaceable cartridge test cap cap component used in its digital strip reader dsr device competitive devices particularly in pregnancy and ovulation testing applications typically require a sample to be applied to a test strip unit prior to insertion into a disposable battery powered digital reader this method can introduce contamination errors inaccuracies and false positives due to delay in reading the activated test strip and generates battery life and recycling issues bioamds cap is a replaceable disposable unit the cap comprises a cartridge mounted test strip with an interlocked test strip cover that can only be removed after the cap is engaged with the dsr engagement of the cap automatically powers up the dsr and allows removal of the cap cover this permits a sample to be immediately read without any further procedural step minimising contamination potential and false positives numerous disposable caps can be read by a single solar powered dsr device reducing test costs and eliminating battery shelflife and disposal problems about dsr the dsr technology is a patented method of reading and quantifying traditional chromatography based lateralflow immunoassays including pregnancy and fertility testing cardiac markers infectious diseases and drug testing  compared to existing analog tests dsr offers increased sensitivity and semiquantitative measurement allowing earlier diagnostic testing with improved accuracy the dsr handheld reader device incorporates portability scalability and repeatability with low
