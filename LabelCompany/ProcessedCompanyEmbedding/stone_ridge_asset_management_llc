 firm overview leadership philosophy markets work rulesbased approach no performance fees  talent wins contact us markets work centuries of financial history have shown that markets reward investors for the capital they supply and the risks they bear  competition quickly drives prices to fair value leaving only risk premium  yet many managers and investors chase alpha an often expensive and dangerous pursuit  at stone ridge we believe that markets work so we let the intentional risks we bear deliver the returns we desire  guessing the future is no way to build longterm wealth – we believe taking intelligent controlled and diversified risks is a far more reliable strategy great financial innovations of the last few decades led to investment products that efficiently capture traditional market risk premium – for example stocks beat cash over time because stocks are riskier  in traditional asset classes like equities and fixed income passive longonly products are sufficient to capture the beta  such products are valuable have enormous capacity and deserve their rightful place in every investor’s portfolio  at stone ridge we strive to deliver the next chapter of financial innovations valuable diversifying streams of alternative returns sourced solely from nontraditional risk exposures next rules based approach  rulesbased approach stone ridge’s rulesbased approach automates access to and execution of complex strategies making them easily accessible and costeffective  our concepts may be easy to explain but systematically capturing our target betas – in areas as varied and specialized as reinsurance implied volatility downside risk momentum and mergers  requires a highlevel of research execution and operational excellence our evolving set of rules aims to systematically capture the returns available from each individual risk we bear  informed by decades of alternative investment management experience academic influences and institutional trading background our rules draw upon almost a century of asset price data across a wide spectrum of asset classes and market regimes  the overall result is an automated processdriven collection of investment strategies designed to build longterm wealth for our investors  prev markets work next no performance fees  talent wins  no performance fees our philosophy of sourcing valuable risks instead of alpha is inconsistent with charging performance fees  when you source priced risks returns are reliably positive on average but unpredictable over any particular interval  some years are great others can hurt – it is simply a function of when the intentional riskbearing pays off  our team has the expertise to identify priced risk factors design automated trading strategies to capture them and dynamically manage the risks within carefully structured portfolios  the excess returns these portfolios deliver over time belong solely to our investors   talent wins our closeknit team of professionals hails from leading global investment banks and alternative asset managers including goldman sachs morgan stanley citadel and magnetar  we also leverage the remarkable analytical talent in china through our partnership with tsinghua university  individually and collectively we are grateful for the opportunity stone ridge represents to apply our expertise towards building longterm
