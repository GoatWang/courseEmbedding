utility customers face sharp rate hike one of the largest utilities in massachusetts that serves more than  million customers across the northeast national grid recently announced that it is seeking a rate hike similar to last year this year national grid residential electric customers will see their massachusetts electricity prices will increase  percent although the rate increase isn’t as high as last year’s rate hike the company reported that a residential customer with a current monthly bill of  will see an increase to  the national grid rate hike in massachusetts should take effect on november   and last through may   these rate hikes reflect the volatile market seasonality and continued gas pipeline constraints consumers interested in protecting their rates from following the volatile market should explore fixedrate options offered by many competitive electric companies including ambit energy constellation energy direct energy hudson energy just energy liberty power suez energy verde energy massachusetts is one of the many states in the country where energy consumers have a choice of both their electricity and natural gas suppliers unlike some markets where choices are more limited to one commodity or narrowed by location most of massachusetts plays by the same rules when it comes to energy deregulation you can still purchase your natural gas or electricity supply from your utility if you want to but choosing a regulated rate plan isnt for everyone for one thing youll have less control over your costs by going with the utility rate in comparison to your options when you choose your own supplier still its important to know your options so that you can make an informed decision deregulated service areas in massachusetts before you can make the most of the massachusetts laws that bring energy choice to so many people you have to ensure you live in a deregulated area consumers in the service territories of these utilities have the option of choosing a competitive plan electricity fitchburg gas and electric light company national grid nstar electric western massachusetts electric company natural gas bay state gas company columbia gas of massachusetts berkshire gas company blackstone gas company fitchburg gas and electric light company national grid new england gas company nstar gas choosing a plan from a competitive supplier is as simple as entering your zip code here at saveonenergycom® if any of our partners offer competitive plans in your area we make it easy to compare the options available to you learn more about massachusetts electricity deregulation massachusetts deregulated its energy market in  essentially creating a separation between the supply and delivery portions of electricity service retail electricity suppliers were allowed to enter the state to offer competitive energy supply options for consumers regardless of whether you choose a competitive supplier or your utility for electricity supply you will see both charges on your energy bill your utility will always charge you delivery fees because it retains the responsibility of transporting electricity to your home as it owns the infrastructure capable of distribution retail suppliers are licensed by the massachusetts department of public utilities but the prices these companies charge are relative to wholesale prices in the electricity market sometimes these wholesale supply prices translate into savings for massachusetts customers who shop around do you find yourself asking who is the best electricity provider in ma by comparing rates plans and customer service options you can easily discover which alternative electric supplier will work best for you deciding what qualities are important to you is the first step to shopping for a retail energy supplier for example if you are an environmental enthusiast or just want to combat climate change you may want to purchase a plan from a retail supplier that offers green energy if you need to cut the costs of your energy bill you should look for the supplier that offers the lowest electricity rate in massachusetts another factor you might want to compare is customer service do you want to make online payments do you want hour assistance is a rewards program important to you by considering these options you are sure to find the best electricity provider in ma massachusetts allows for natural gas options too in the late s massachusetts unbundled the supply and delivery portions of natural gas service creating an environment of increased competition for customer benefit residential business and industrial customers were given the opportunity to choose among competitive natural gas suppliers the idea behind the unbundling or deregulation of the natural gas industry was to give consumers an alternative to the local utilitys rates before this legislation went into effect residents had to purchase natural gas from their utility after the law passed everything changed consumers were given the freedom of natural gas choice in most areas of massachusetts you no longer have to settle for utility supply rates or plans you can shop around to find the natural gas supplier that best fits your needs the difference between competitive suppliers and your utility is simple competitive natural gas providers sell unique packages for your natural gas supply directly to consumers they purchase gas in bulk allowing them to offer different pricing and a number of plan options to cater to different types of consumers if youd rather not shop for a new plan massachusetts law allows you to receive default service from your utility regardless of whether you opt to go with a competitive supplier or not your utility will continue to deliver your gas to your home because it still owns and maintains the infrastructure in its service area explore alternative energy options in massachusetts many states have set renewable portfolio standards rps goals to grow renewable energy production and massachusetts is one of them in  the massachusetts department of energy resources adjusted the states rps class  renewable energy category to include distributed solar photovoltaic pv energy facilities this change helped encourage more programs supporting other types of renewable energy production such as wind as well as solar power in massachusetts massachusetts solar energy programs include incentives for new residential and commercial pv systems rebates and loan programs may be available to energy consumers who install small residential or commercial systems the state is also directing grant funding to several pilot communities to streamline complicated regulatory processes associated with distributed solar power projects
