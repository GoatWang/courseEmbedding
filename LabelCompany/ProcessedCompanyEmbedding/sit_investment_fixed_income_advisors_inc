we are not duration managers within the stated philosophy our fixed income separate account objectives are established to provide superior results compared to benchmarks and managers of a similar style avoid excessive return volatility and generate consistent returns over an economic cycle structure portfolios to meet specific client needs taxable fixed income general strategy interest income provides the vast majority of a bond portfolio s total return over an interest rate cycle sit investment s taxable fixed income process focuses on earning high levels of interest income from high quality securities in general we underweight us government  agency bonds and overweight corporate assetbacked and mortgage pass throughsecurities overall our clients investment objectives and guidelines govern our industry and sector limits more so than the benchmark municipal fixed income general strategy interest income provides the vast majority of a bond portfolio s total return over an interest rate cycle sit investment s municipal fixed income process focuses on strong individual security analysis and seeks investment grade quality securities which have high levels of coupon interest income and complexities such as sinking fund and prepayment provisions the former provides income and lower volatility the latter produces shorter expected lives and relatively higher yield the combination is a strong book yield and aftertax return advantage using high quality securities investment strategies and risk of loss sit fia manages client accounts with the following general investment strategies specific client objectives and restrictions are set forth in the investment management agreement with each client and differ from client to client for example clients may impose restrictions on investing in certain issuers or types of securities or may define a benchmark differently than other clients the following descriptions of investment strategies and instruments are not intended to be exhaustive sit fia may employ various additional strategies and instruments from time to time in a manner consistent a client s investment management agreement  investments in the fixed income portfolios may include obligations of the us government its agencies and instrumentalities mortgagebacked securities including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos assetbacked securities corporate debt securities municipal obligations issued by us states territories and possessions and the district of columbia and their political subdivisions agencies and instrumentalities both revenue bonds and general obligation bonds closedend registered investment companies closedend funds and openend registered investment companies mutual funds that invest in such fixed income

bond index risks investing in securities involves risk of loss that clients should be prepared to bear the material risks of investing in fixed income securities include call risk many bonds may be redeemed  called  at the option of the issuer before their stated maturity date in general an issuer will call its bonds if they can be refinanced by issuing new bonds which bear a lower interest rate a portfolio may then be forced to invest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates resulting in a decline in a portfolio s income  credit risk the issuers or guarantors of securities including us government agencies and instrumentalities issuing securities that are not guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government owned by a portfolio may default on the payment of principal or interest or the other party to a contract may default on its obligations to a portfolio causing the value of a portfolio to decrease credit risk the issuer of a debt security or a guarantor of a security held by a portfolio or counterparty to a transaction may default on its payment obligations or experience a decline in credit quality generally the lower the credit rating of a security issuer guarantor or counterparty the higher the degree of risk as to the payment of interest and return of principal also a downgrade in the credit quality of a security or its issuer or guarantor may cause the security to decline in value and could affect the bond s liquidity and make it more difficult for a portfolio to sell when a portfolio purchases unrated securities it will depend on our analysis of credit risk without the assessment of an independent rating organization such as moody s or standard  poor s there is always the risk that our analysis of creditworthiness is incorrect or may change due to market conditions highyield risk debt securities rated below investmentgrade or if nonrated determined to be of comparable quality by us are commonly known as junk bonds junk bonds are considered predominately speculative and involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuer s creditworthiness in addition there may be less of a market for these securities which could make it harder to sell them at an acceptable price these and related risks mean that a portfolio may not achieve the expected return from noninvestment grade debt securities and may be adversely affected by declines in the value of these securities income risk the income a portfolio earns may decline due to declining interest rates this is because in a falling interest rate environment a portfolio generally will have to invest the proceeds from maturing portfolio securities or portfolio securities that have been called see call risk below in loweryielding securities interest rate risk an increase in interest rates will cause debt securities held by a portfolio to decline in value and thereby lower a portfolio s value and its overall return the magnitude of this decrease is often greater for longerterm fixed income securities than shorterterm securities liquidity risk the portfolio may not be able to sell certain debt securities with more limited trading opportunities at a favorable price or time including high yield securities that have received ratings below investment grade recent events have caused the markets for some debt securities to experience lower valuations and reduced liquidity consequently a portfolio may have to accept a lower price to sell a security sell other securities to raise cash or give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on a portfolio s performance infrequent trading may also lead to greater price volatility management risk a portfolio s performance will reflect in part our ability to implement its investment strategy and make investment decisions which are suited to achieving a portfolio s investment objective a strategy used by us may fail to produce the intended results a portfolio could underperform its benchmark market risk the market value of securities may fall or fail to rise market risk may affect a single issuer sector of the economy industry or the market as a whole the market value of securities may fluctuate sometimes rapidly and unpredictably the market for some types of securities is highly competitive portfolios will be competing for investment opportunities with a significant number of financial institutions and institutional investors many of these competitors are larger and have  greater financial human and other resources and may in certain circumstances have a competitive advantage over the portfolio managed by us as a result of this competition there may be fewer attractively priced investment opportunities which could have an adverse impact on the ability of a portfolio to meet its investment objectives or the length of time that is required for a portfolio to become fully invested there can be no assurance that the returns on a portfolio s investments will be commensurate with the risk nondiversification risk a portfolio that is nondiversified as is typical of singlestate municipal bond portfolio will invest a larger portion of its assets in a limited number of issuers than a diversified portfolio because a relatively high percentage of a portfolio s assets may be invested in the securities of a limited number of issuers the portfolio may be more susceptible to any single economic political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund political economic and tax risk the value of the income generated by and the ability of a portfolio to sell a municipal security may be affected by constitutional amendment legislative enactments executive orders administrative regulations and voter initiatives as well as the economics of the regions in which the issuers in which a portfolio invests are located municipal securities backed by current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or asset such as revenue bonds can be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the project or assets or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from the assets the value of municipal securities also may be adversely affected by future changes in federal or state income tax laws including rate reductions the imposition of a flat tax or the loss of a current state income tax exemption if the internal revenue service determines that an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax requirements interest from the security could be treated as taxable which could result in a decline in the security s value to the extent that a municipal security in which a portfolio invests is not heavily followed by the investment community or such security issue is relatively small the security may be difficult to value or sell at a fair price prepayment and extension risk declining interest rates may compel borrowers to prepay mortgages and debt obligations underlying the mortgagebacked securities owned by a portfolio the proceeds received by a portfolio from prepayments will likely be reinvested at interest rates lower than the original investment thus resulting in a reduction of income to the portfolio likewise rising interest rates could reduce prepayments and extend the life of securities with lower interest rates which may increase the sensitivity of a portfolio s value to rising interest rates sector concentration risk because a portfolio may invest a significant portion of their assets in health care facility bonds housing authority bonds andor education bonds a portfolio may be more affected by events influencing these sectors than a fund that is more diversified across numerous sectors us government securities risk us government agency securities in which a portfolio may invest include securities issued by the government national mortgage association  ginnie mae  the federal national mortgage association  fannie mae  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation  freddie mac  securities issued by ginnie mae are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac are supported by the right to borrow directly from the us treasury other us government securities are supported only by the credit of the issuer or instrumentality there is a risk that the us government will not provide financial support to us government agencies or instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so by law securities purchased by a portfolio issued by fannie mae and freddie mac are neither issued nor guaranteed by the us treasury and therefore are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states an agency of the us government has placed fannie mae and freddie mac into  conservatorship with the objective of improving the entities business operations it is unclear what effect this conservatorship will have on the securities issued or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac valuation risk the portfolio may hold securities for which prices from pricing services may be unavailable or are deemed unreliable there is a risk that the fair value determined by the custodian or us or the price determined by the pricing service may be different than the actual sale prices of such securities closedend fund risk in addition to the general risks of investing in fixed income securities discussed above risk factors associated with closedend funds include market risk and concentration risk closedend funds are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities the market price of a closedend fund may be significantly different than its nav a premium or a discount closedend funds frequently trade at a discount to nav and there is no assurance a closedend fund will appreciate to its nav disciplinary information item  sit fia has no information applicable to this

designed to ensure that our high ethical standards are continually applied employees are required to annually certify their compliance with the code of ethics sit fia its affiliates and employees may buy or sell for themselves securities that we also buy or sell on behalf of our clients consistent with the clients investment objectives and restrictions restrictions on the personal trading activities of sit fia s employees include among others things preclearance of all transactions a  day blackout period a restricted security list prohibitions on shortterm trading and initial public offerings and limits on the number of transactions over certain periods of time the code of ethics contains various exemptions for trades we believe do not involve potential conflicts such as government securities and openend mutual funds the code of ethics also contains reporting requirements so that the personal trading may be monitored the code of ethics is designed to assure that the personal securities transactions not interfere with our making decisions in the best interest of our clients nonetheless because the code of ethics in some circumstances would permit employees to invest in the same securities as clients there is a possibility that employees might benefit from market activity by a client in a security held by an employee other prohibitions applicable to our employees include accepting gifts of more than nominal value and borrowing money from clients certain affiliated accounts may trade in the same securities with client accounts on an aggregated basis when consistent with sit fias obligation of best execution in such circumstances the affiliated and client accounts will share commission costs equally and receive securities at a total average price sit fia s clients or prospective clients may request a copy of the firms code of ethics by contacting paul rasmussen at brokerage practices item  trading of bonds fixed income securities are generally purchased from or sold to brokers or dealers brokerdealers maintain inventories of bonds that they own as principals and hold for resale to their customers in purchasing and selling bonds for client accounts we attempt to contact multiple brokers before executing a trade in order to seek best execution when we purchase bonds we seek specific bond issues or we seek bonds with certain characteristics including type sector maturity duration coupon and yield objectives when acting as principal the broker will typically add a markup to any purchase and subtract a markdown from every sale the markup or markdown will be included in the price and yield of the security closedend registered investment companies closedend funds trade as equity securities on a national exchange and the broker charges a commission based on the number of shares research and soft dollar benefits in effecting purchases and sales of portfolio securities for client accounts including investment companies we will seek best execution of the orders consistent with this policy orders for portfolio transactions are placed with brokerdealer firms giving consideration to the quality quantity and nature of the firms professional services which include execution clearance procedures and market statistical and other research information provided to sit fia and its clients all these factors are taken into account in the allocation of brokerage and thus lowest price is not necessarily the determining factor sit fia feels that it is to the overall benefit of its clients and clients of its subsidiary to receive these benefits from brokerdealers and not to have to duplicate these services by expensive additions to sit fia s staff nothing in this policy relieves sit fia of its responsibility of reviewing the research and making the ultimate determination on transactions based on its own expertise it is quite possible that the research benefits received from any one order will not inure to the direct benefit of the client including a mutual fund placing the order but we feel that the aggregate benefits of information received from all orders will benefit all our clients including the clients of our subsidiaries while sit fia will be primarily responsible for the allocation of the clients brokerage business the policies and practices for sit fia in this regard must be consistent with the foregoing and will at all times be subject to review by the client during  sit fia s affiliate sit fixed income advisors ii llc and its parent company sit investment associates inc received approximately  different services and products from  different brokerdealers from softdollar arrangements the affiliates received both proprietary research which is created or developed by the brokerdealer and research created or developed by a third party among the services and products received were financial economic and political information services and research reports periodic specialized financial market research financial market statistical information industry and sector analysis economic political and market commentary issuer credit research online bond trading services quantitative research and analysis and market prices and quotation services a complete list of the services and products received is available to clients upon request although we seek best execution of transactions obtaining research and services by means of soft dollar arrangements represents a conflict of interest since it enables us to receive research that we might otherwise have to purchase with our own money therefore we may have an incentive to select a brokerdealer based on our interest in receiving the research or other products or services rather than our clients interest in receiving most favorable execution we may cause clients to pay commissions higher than those charged by other brokerdealers in return for soft dollar benefits  order aggregation the aggregation or blocking of client transactions allows sit fia to execute transactions in a more timely equitable and efficient manner and seeks to reduce overall commission charges to clients our policy is to aggregate client transactions where possible and when advantageous to clients in these instances clients participating in any aggregated transactions will receive an average share price and transaction costs will be shared equally and on a prorata basis our policy prohibits any allocation of trades in a manner that our proprietary accounts affiliated accounts or any particular clients or group of clients receive more favorable treatment than other client accounts sit fia has adopted a policy for the fair and equitable allocation of transactions using a prorata allocation method equity security transactions are processed using an electronic order management system transactions are allocated to all applicable client accounts based on portfolio characteristics such as account size cash levels the model portfolio target weightings and investment restrictions fixed income security transactions are allocated by the trader to all applicable client accounts based on portfolio characteristics such as cash and liquidity requirements portfolio duration quality requirements and investment restrictions certain clients have directed us to use a particular broker in effecting purchases and sales of its portfolio securities and therefore our services would not include selection of brokerage firms or negotiation of commission rates generally under such circumstances the client may receive products or services from the broker directly if a client chooses to direct its brokerage to a broker other than the one through which sit fia will execute orders for its other clients the client will forgo any benefit from savings on execution costs that the adviser could obtain for its other clients through for example discounts on batched orders in some situations we may execute a transaction with one broker and settle the transaction with another broker this use of stepouts allows us to split the execution services and the research services from the brokers that is by executing a transaction with an execution broker and stepout the transaction and related commissions to a broker who provides research services to book and settle the transaction cross trades sit fia may under certain circumstances effect crosstrades which means the purchase and sale of a security between two or more accounts including pooled investment funds managed by us or our affiliates in certain situations it is advantageous to clients to engage in a crosstrade these situations can arise for many reasons often an account will have incoming cash that needs to be invested and at the same time another account is withdrawing funds and needs to sell portfolio securities to raise cash another situation in which a crosstrade may be desirable is when the characteristics of a particular security change since sit fia serves as the investment adviser for both the buyer and the seller of the security there may be an inherent conflict of interest all crosstrades are executed at a fair price and no client is disfavored by the transaction sit fia receives no compensation from effecting a crosstrade sit fia has policies and procedures to ensure the transactions are done on a fair and equitable basis and in the best interests of the clients where a registered investment company is involved in the transaction the requirements of rule a under the investment company act of  are complied with commissions are not paid on purchases and sales between registered investment companies subject to rule a of the investment company act of  but such transactions may be charged transfer fees if in the event an account subject to the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of  erisa was involved in the transaction the requirements of section b of erisa would be complied with  generally sit fia effects a crosstrade by placing simultaneous buy and sell orders for a security through an independent brokerdealer who then effects both transactions at a determined commission sit fia does not intend to execute a crosstrade by instructing the custodians to transfer the security from one client s account to the other notwithstanding the above sit fia may initiate the purchase and sale of a security in the market on behalf of two or more clients on the same day but through different independent brokerdealers andor at different times of the day generally such a transaction is not considered a crosstrade for purposes of the crosstrade procedures  review of accounts item  client accounts receive almost constant review from the professional staff including the members of the investment committee and the research and investment management professionals at least one investment professional is assigned prime responsibility for a client s account and the investment committee structure facilitates frequent account review through weekly meetings of the investment committee and the other investment professionals as well as numerous informal meetings among the investment professionals all transactions are reviewed daily by the chief investment officer sit fia furnishes each client except clients participating in a wrap program with written reports regarding the client s portfolio which includes holdings transactions investment performance the investment strategy and other pertinent information tailored to the needs of the particular client portfolio reports are provided monthly or as requested by the client the written reports are often supplemented by frequent oral reports to the client from an investment professional and also by regular review meetings with the client as requested by the client client referrals and other compensation item  sit fia does not compensate anyone for referring clients to us nor do we receive compensation from other professionals for referring clients to them custody item  sit fia does not maintain physical custody of client assets clients are responsible for selecting and engaging a custodian clients should receive statements from the qualified custodian that holds and maintains the client s assets at least quarterly clients should carefully review such statements and compare such official custodial records to the account statements that we provide to you our statements may vary from custodial statements based on accounting procedures reporting dates or valuation methodologies of certain securities sit fia s affiliates provide investment advisory services and serve as general partner or manager to private investment companies organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies and therefore may be deemed to have custody or possession of client assets for purposes of rule  of the investment advisers act of investment discretion item  sit fia manages client assets on a discretionary basis pursuant to the investment management agreement with each client investment discretion is exercised in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and restrictions for the particular client account as set forth in the investment management agreement clients may impose restrictions including for example on investing in certain companies or types of securities  view more similar documents part a of form adv firm brochure direct clients part a of form adv firm brochure wellesley investment advisors inc  william street wellesley ma
