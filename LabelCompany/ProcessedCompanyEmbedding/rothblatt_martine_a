otherwise unusable lungs into transplantable condition whitney sheftethe washington post let’s be clear martine rothblatt is just plain more of a lawyer than anybody else in this town the yearold grandmother and ceo of united therapeutics the silver springbased biotech she founded to help save her younger daughter’s life banked  million last year it made her the nation’s highestpaid female executive it also made her the nation’s highestpaid transgendered person as she had sex reassignment surgery in  in a lab on spring street rothblatt’s newest project appears lifted from science fiction disembodied but breathing human lungs hissing away in domeshaped incubators part of a clinical trial attempting to mend donated but notquiteacceptedfortransplant lungs so that they can actually be placed in living human beings on a virginia farm she’s also raising genetically altered pigs in the hope that someday their lungs and other organs will be modified for use in human transplant creating a nearly inexhaustible supply of organ donors she just published “virtually human” a bigthink manifesto on the rights of yettobecreated cyberhumans who might one day be uploaded with all of your thoughts dreams memories and online activity and live for eternity as a sortof you she founded a religion the terasem movement which puts together her cultural judaism she puts on a mean seder zenlike yoga and a deep belief in technology one of the four founding beliefs “death is optional” the physical manifestation of this faith is a bodyless robot named and modeled after rothblatt’s second wife bina the robot bina is just a head it has a face made of frubber wears a goodlooking wig has facialscanning software in her “eyes” so that when her head whirs and clicks then locks on your face she’s running your profile to see if she “knows” you bina lives on a desk in rural vermont awaiting the day when man and machine are one farfetched hey go ahead yuk it up rothblatt is buddies with larry page and ray kurzweil who sort of run a little company called google kurzweil the futurist and director of engineering at google is on united therapeutics’ board of directors and thinks bina is a glimpse of the future in the late s rothblatt conceived of and created a crazy company devoted to the idea of worldwide satellite radio today that’s sirius xm it’s in your car’s dashboard next to the satellite navigation device  and she was president of geostar the first company to market that too her college thesis became the first private satellite phone company “she has to my knowledge a perfect track record in making her visions real” kurzweil writes in an email rothblatt dropped out of the satellite orbit because her and bina’s daughter was diagnosed at  with what is now called pulmonary arterial hypertension an incurable lung disease it progressively narrows the lung’s arteries to the point of death by  jenesis would faint all the time her life seeping away in intensive care units so rothblatt sold out of sirius set to studying biology — the last such course she had taken was in th grade — and formed ut today jenesis is  in good health and does filmproduction work for the now billion firm martine led the company to developing a new fdaapproved pill for pulmonary arterial hypertension orenitram “martine ro” backward the stock price soared and so did her incentive package amid all this martine and bina have been married for  years before and after rothblatt’s gender surgery they’re so joined at the hip that the kids refer to them as “marbina” their younger son gabriel just ran for congress in florida’s eighth district democrat lost but a respectable debut when rothblatt set up a  super pac to fund gabriel’s campaign — without his knowledge he says — she drew a rebuke from the new york times editorial page for parental abuse of electoral process let’s see  what else she flies airplanes and helicopters kills on the piano runs

this one a million times idealistic young lawyer comes to your nation’s capital to make a difference and gets kicked in the teeth with rothblatt it’s the real story she — he then — joined covington and burling in  as an entrylevel policy wonk in telcom law she was  and already on a second marriage with two kids and two more on the way the young couple was scraping by living in a onebedroom flat near the national zoo idealistic young lawyer went nowhere at covington when i called the firm recently to chat with someone who remembered her work there  no one did “they wanted me to lobby for broadcasters against the beginnings of satellite radio” rothblatt offers “and i was all for the other team” she quit after  months and enrolled in the graduate astronomy program at the university of maryland mom dad and the kids piled into married student housing this slightly idealistic poverty was nothing new rothblatt was born in chicago raised in san diego and los angeles the grandchild of jewish immigrants from eastern europe dad harold worked as a dentist at a labor union and mother rosa lee worked as a speech therapist marty as rothblatt was called and a sister janet were the only children in a household that believed in faith decency and hard work “there was no cursing not even ‘damn’ and the children were expected to be courteous” says rosa lee rothblatt now retired and living just outside los angeles in a house with bina’s mom bertha “they were to study and they knew to volunteer their time to charitable causes” rothblatt’s father is deceased her sister politely declined to comment for this story the family was observantly jewish — marty played the theme from “exodus” at the bar mitzvah — and lived on modest means marty enrolled in ucla but quit after a year to travel on the cheap with buddies van rides across europe selling the van in turkey teaching english in iran touring eastern africa  wound up living in a ratty house in the seychelles islands which was supposed to be cool it wasn’t while there a buddy took rothblatt to a us satellite installation there — right there — is where she says her mind took an exponential leap forward imagining how close future worlds really were marty went back to ucla with a wild new energy and a family in tow the marriage to a kenyan woman soon collapsed but marty raised their son eli on his own father and son lived in dire if selfimposed poverty while dad spent seven years going through undergrad law and the mba programs “martine wanted to do things on her own” her mom remembers “literally the starving student” remembers paul rosenthal then chairman of the communications school “i remember her wearing one checked shirt and pair of jeans every day it may have been all she had” charlie firestone remembers marty clearly — “the most brilliant student i had in  years of teaching at ucla law school  just a fascinating mind” it was  when marty met bina a real estate agent at a mixer in hollywood the two shared an instant attraction and mutual life circumstances bina was a single parent too of a young daughter named sunee they soon married moved to dc crossadopted eli and sunee and eventually had gabriel and jenesis by the mids rothblatt was getting a reputation among the space law cognoscenti for brilliance and knowledge of fcc regulations and of the intricacies of broadcasting wavelengths “a conceptual genius” says tobey marzouk partner at marzouk  parry who was legal partners with rothblatt in the s “her ideas were quantum leaps of the technology at the time” rothblatt was hired as a lobbyist for a fledgling concern called geostar initially a satellite tracking service for trucking companies rothblatt worked insane hours — going to the office about  am for a day’s research and planning before the doors opened seven hours later — but the family was tightknit bina had converted to judaism and often worked as his de facto office manager bina’s mom who had moved in with them watched the kids on friday evenings they would have “love night” at home it began with a family song love night love night love is all around love night love night here love can be found family is our source of our strength forever we are one and the same love night love night love is all around “that was at the dinner table” says gabriel rothblatt  now a father of four and living in melbourne beach “we’d all have dinner or go out to dinner sitting around the table bless the bread and light the candles we’d go from oldest to youngest and everyone say what love meant to them this week it was an opportunity for everybody to speak while everyone else is quiet but it was also a session to reflect on the meaning of love during the previous week and how it affected you” by the early s rothblatt had founded cd satellite radio a forerunner of satellite worldwide radio then changed the name to sirius for the brightest star in the sky rothblatt came out first to bina announcing an affinity for wearing dresses and bina said it was no big deal the kids were not exactly thrilled — some friends stopped coming over some people stared at martin in a dress — but they told the kids not to worry martine was always going to be their dad bina was always going to be their mom and stupid people were always going to be stupid the gender switch led to martine’s first manifestotype book “the apartheid of sex” it argued that people come in vast ranges of sexualities and that two genders simply could not describe the reality the book got a  publishing contract sirius went to its ipo rothblatt earned millions she was  years old james zhan left and specialist sam popa work on a lung being kept alive and restored in an incubator at united therapeutics which is pioneering new methods for lung transplant andré chungfor the washington post psshhhttt hsshhhttt pssshhttt hssshhtttt most likely you’ve never been in a room with a disembodied set of lungs watching it breathe via a ventilator it’s kind of creepy the sides coming together all wet and fleshy and fluffing back out again  we are in a hightech lab of lung biotechnology a subsidiary of ut we are checking in on rothblatt’s clinical trial to reclaim marginal lungs not accepted for transplant the facility is just across from the company’s spring street headquarters in a sealed room that looks like a surgical suite — tubes and air lines and flat screens displaying realtime medical data everybody wearing paper overalls and masks and booties — are said lungs in a circular glass incubator yesterday they were breathing in the chest of a yearold man a year smoker and drug user last night he died of a stroke this morning they’re here they’re big — huge actually because the lungs tend to expand when not compressed by the rib cage — and the clear plastic dome fogs with condensation the staff led by thomas hartnett  has been running fluids and medication through the lungs to maintain and assess them while removing excess fluids a broncoscope with a tiny camera runs through the main passageways offering views of the interior the data they’re picking up goes to the cloud so any doctor on the system with internet access — even a smartphone on a golf course — can determine if it might work for transplant should the process be approved in the united states it would significantly reshape the highpressure ecosystem of lung transplants about  lungs are donated each year but on average over a decade only  find continued life in someone else there are six to eight hours to make the switch — a huge network of jets helicopters ambulances and surgeons are on call — yet more than twothirds are not in the final analysis approved for transplant rothblatt’s project is to preserve those marginal donations — out of body for up to  hours — so that they might be maintained while a suitable recipient is found the process is legal in canada and rothblatt’s company is among a few trying to win fda approval it has worked on more than  lungs since may practicing and documenting results once the process is approved the company will start putting the lungs in patients on a trial basis “the idea is to get  or  donated lungs per week” hartnett says “about  a year that would double the number of transplants” and as he points out that’s no small thing transplants are for endstage lung disease people who do not get them in time — and there’s a long waiting list — do not live there are many diseases that can result in the need for a full or partial lung transplant one of them is pulmonary arterial hypertension because it has no known cure a lung transplant may someday be required for the very soul of the company bina and martine rothblatt with daughter jenesis whose illness inspired the founding of united therapeutics photo courtesy of jenesis rothblattfor the washington post jenesis rothblatt comes walking down a bethesda sidewalk on a midautumn evening to meet for dinner the impression is not of a lung patient she’s tall vibrant angular strikingly attractive high cheek bones bright smile “i haven’t fainted in  maybe  years” she says sitting down ordering a glass of red she started getting short of breath at about  on family skiing trips later the spells would come at random “i’d start to hear something like the tinkling of fairy dust if that makes any sense then i’d see little dark spots going from the outside in until it was one big black spot” she’d faint dropping as if shot bina on the terror of the time “i was doing her hair one time just combing it out and she just collapsed right through my hands i couldn’t catch her she was out” the medication at the time was not particularly effective there were iv pumps her parents waking her in the night to give her medication rothblatt left sirius desperately trying to find better treatment but the disease had about  patients in the united states — it was so rare and treatment so expensive that major pharmaceutical companies weren’t interested rothblatt pestered experts set up a foundation and sent out requests for proposals then she and bina took jenesis traveling “she was about  or  she was on oxygen and we thought her life was about over” rothblatt said “we thought ‘let’s just show her what we can of the world’ ” they toured seeing the great wall of china and when they came back rothblatt was stunned to find several doctors had answered her requests she was impressed with james crow a justretired research scientist who had done work on the condition and got him to come on board they eventually developed a key drug remodulin that helped keep blood pathways open in the lungs though it is delivered by injection or a pump they developed tyvaso which is inhaled and finally orenitram a pill the medications can cost north of  per year but as treatments improved so did the number of patients able to benefit from them today more than  patients are treated with these or similar drugs each year “all of these are people just would not be alive without these medicines” rothblatt said at a recent conference jenesis’s condition slowly improved but she tired of the illness and the sheltered lifestyle it imposed “i still wanted to be able to go out and do the things other kids my age were sleepovers roller coasters staying up past  pm” so she rebelled “i drank i skipped class i wouldn’t take my medication” but then as the pages on the calendar turned she matured studied audio engineering then biochemistry ut didn’t provide the only medication she took but it was at the forefront of the field today she takes three pills per day one made by ut and feels lazy if she takes an elevator up a floor rather than hoofing it she just moved to la still working for the company but a little glad to get out of the home office “because it was founded in my honor there’s really no way i could be disassociated from it whether i worked there or not” she says “on one hand it’s very humbling it’s so special it’s kind of cool but sometimes you’d like to be a little more anonymous” martine and bina rothblatt at ut headquarters a couple so close their children call them “marbina” andré chungfor the washington post one of the first things you notice about rothblatt is that she has a very offhand manner second she’s almost comically upbeat she effusively praises subordinates in meetings compliments the waiter at lunch on the tea and praises bina in all things — even if it’s her habit of rearranging furniture unbidden even if it’s the sitting room of a doctor’s office “she’s got a natural sense of feng shui” rothblatt is foot rangy an athletic lope to her stride she sometimes wears custommade women’s suits “women’s clothes don’t really fit me men’s clothes don’t really fit me” but mostly she knocks around in dark slacks and a pullover on this particular recent evening she has her hair flatironed is wearing dark slacks a turtleneck and a leather jacket if she told you she was a yoga instructor you’d totally go for it she bina and i were chatting in a sitting area on the sixth floor of ut headquarters the cubed tables change colors every few seconds it was after closing hours and when a stray employee walked past rothblatt halts the conversation to call out “thanks for working late” it grew late as we were leaving she pointed out the window across the street the lights were still on at the lab “they’re sending our first lung to be transplanted tonight in toronto” she said “see the ambulance” the transplant was completed at  am eight hours later she emailed me pictures replete with time stamps “last night one fewer person died on the transplant list” she wrote exultant “i feel confident that we’ll at minimum double  of transplants by end of teens” roll your eyes sure go ahead then go back up near the beginning of this story and when betting against the future reread the handicapping of ray kurzweil generally

�she’s an outstanding conceptual salesperson� says her friend and fellow futurist ray kurzweil martine has described her sirius entrepreneurship more bluntly �i was a toughtalking satellite engineer� bina was as surprised as anyone when her husband told her in the early ’s of his desire to become a woman and martine has said she delayed broaching the subject until she was certain bina would not leave �i love you for your soul not your skin� is how bina responded �i was so lucky� martine reflects now �so so lucky� and so began the years of transition there were hormones of course and endless hours of psychotherapy aimed at establishing that martine’s urge was neither fleeting nor shallow she began dressing as a woman in everwidening circles�first out with bina alone then with friends and finally on weekends with the kids and their friends the children i spoke to three out of four agree it was an anguishing time they were teased at school �who wears the pants in your family now�  neighbors moved away in the conventional narrative about sex reassignment a person is so sure from such a young age that he or she inhabits the wrong body that a surgically corrected self is a lifelong dream martine says the idea was in her mind from the time she was about  years old �i idealized myself in my mind as female� she says even using the word �gay� �in the sense of seeing myself as a woman sexually attracted to women� but this female selfimage didn’t drive or define her and it didn’t exclude other visions of herself �i loved my penis� she told howard stern in a  interview her female identity was also invisible to those around her and not just to bina �there is absolutely nothing that would indicate that this was his tendency or preference absolutely nothing� rosa lee told me �she isn’t a woman and neither am i� added martine’s friend kate bornstein one of the founders of the transgender movement who saw a special courage in martine’s disinclination to fully embrace either gender at a time during the mid’s when �gender queer� had not yet become a familiar term gabriel rothblatt the third of martine and bina’s children remembers the day when he was  years old that martine told him about her imminent surgery they were at the mall now  gabriel is a father of four and running for congress as a democrat in florida’s eighth district with a platform whose first item is �space� �will you still be my dad� gabriel asked �i’ll still be your dad� martine answered �i’m not changing i’m only changing physically i’m going to be like a butterfly� as adults the siblings have hashed over martine’s choice gabriel says if genitalia aren’t defining then why put yourself and the people you love through such a painful process gabriel says he long ago made peace with martine’s decision �she did what she felt was right the right choice for her� but he also sees that it may have sprung as much from her lifelong determination to cross all borders as from a compulsion that was bred in the bone �sometimes it’s necessary to be a living example� gabriel told me �if the point was just rhetorical if this was just some philosophical scrabbling the message wouldn’t have been as strong� then he brings up what he calls the familiar joke about why the libertarian chicken crossed the road �the libertarian chicken dreams of the day when no one asks them why they crossed the road it’s your body it’s your choice what you choose to do with it it’s not even our place or our business to be judging them or asking them why� next �identify the corridors of indifference and

conference martine rothblatt thank you operator and good morning everybody im joined today by james edgemond our chief financial officer i will offer some brief introductory remarks and then turn over the call to questions that can be directed to james or myself this morning i would like to hit on four main topics profits products pipeline and payers first with regard to profits we are once again in the plus range gross margin on our revenues and in the past quarter those revenues hit  million that keeps us well above the  billion per year revenue run rate that was our goal for  and it keeps us right on track for our goal of  billion per year by the end of the decade profit comparisons with last year are a bit complicated by last years extraordinary gain on the sale of our fda voucher but nongaap per diluted share profits are up  this year from the matching quarter last year i do expect substantial increases in rd spending going forward as we have now grown our pipeline from one to six phase iii or registration design studies and have accelerated our drug device combination work in many ways nevertheless even with this heightened rd spending i am confident we will remain strong profitability – we will maintain strong profitability let me now turn to the second topic products our treprostinil products – remodulin tyvaso and orenitram – faired differentially from the matching quarter last year with orenitram growing  tyvaso dropping  and remodulin inching up a percent these results reflect the ability of patients to remain on one or another of the everincreasing number of oral therapies longer than in the past hence the normal  annual patient attrition that we have long experienced with tyvaso due to disease progression is no longer fully compensated for in real time with new starts from patients failing oral therapies instead patients failures on indiscernible for example of about  a year per their label they first go to uptravi and then to orenitram or vice versa before ending up on tyvaso or remodulin however the more patients who are on oral drugs for a longer period of time ultimately just means that there will be even more patients on tyvaso and remodulin the dip in tyvaso revenues is also transient because we have two phase iii trials underway that will result in a substantial growth well beyond its current level of sales and beyond what will arise from the backlog of patients now cycling through oral therapy the first phase iii trial involving tyvaso is beat which is now over  enrolled and is designed to double the average time patients are on tyvaso by combining it with tysuberprost which is the most adverse prostacyclin receptoractivating agent based on the in vitro studies the second phase iii trial is increase which is designed for the blue water market of who group  pulmonary hypertension which has some  patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis so by keeping patients on tyvaso much longer even after they fail oral therapies and by bringing tens of thousands of new patients to tyvaso we expect its peak revenues to rebound to well above current levels on top of the resources of tyvaso growth the growing backlog of tyvaso patients who are now being managed on the oral drugs will almost all eventually end up on tyvaso andor remodulin so there is a big increase in tyvaso patients coming let me also mention that the ip situation on tyvaso is very strong we have patent protection out to the late s – in fact  in particular while companies may try to attack these patents i think they will have little chance of defeating multiple patents as well as a drug approval that is tied to a particular and quite unique device of which we are the only manufacturer now let me turn to orenitram we also expect continued growth in orenitram as patients fail etra and pde therapies even before trying uptravi or after failing uptravi in addition we expect this growth to be further accelerated with each of the four upcoming events one results of the freedomev trial demonstrated morbidity mortality benefits of orenitram two results of the new indiscernible study demonstrating the benefit of orenitram above and beyond tadalafil and ambrisentan three results of the southpaw study demonstrating the benefits of orenitram for group  pulmonary hypertension patients and four results of the irons study demonstrating the benefits for orenitram for group  pulmonary hypertension patients these four orenitram acceleration events will occur at the rate of one about every  to  months for the next five years of growth and as a further bonus orenitram is protected by nine orange book patents going out to  here is an interesting little factoid the average number of patents that protect an approved drug is about three with the median being even lower about two so orenitram is about  times to  times the number of orange book patents protecting it as the average in our industry but it only takes one patent to protect you and i think of these nine orange book patents on orenitram as the nine lives of orenitram and we are still on just our first life meanwhile our nonprostacyclin product adcirca continues to grow smartly based on the results of the ambition morbiditymortality study that showed ambrisentan when combined with our drug adcirca produces the same kind of reduction of morbidity as does uptravi but at a much lower price we would expect more and more payers to require ambrisentan and adcirca therapy before permitting patients to be reimbursed on more expensive therapies this also has a temporary effect by the way of diminishing the flow of patients on to tyvaso or remodulin as mentioned earlier but as we have seen this quarter the total volume of pah patients ultimately needing tyvaso and remodulin remains the same they are just rightshifted in time as a swelling backflow of patients ultimately progress through their oral medications and the vast majority of these patients do we expect them to – see them treated with tyvaso and remodulin as there are no alternatives with anything near the market share of tyvaso and remodulin indeed with our planned tysuberprost product in phase iii and our remosynch product queued for  approval the tyvaso and remodulin alternatives and followons to oral therapies will be better than ever weve spoken quite a bit about our products now let me turn to our pipeline we now have six products in our phase iii or registration study pipeline plus several more in phase ii or earlier stages the phase iii products not discussed earlier in my intro include orenileft for who group  pulmonary hypertension specifically indiscernible orenicell for who group  pulmonary hypertension specifically pulmonary hypertension associated with sickle cell disease if our southpaw and irons studies for group  and group  pulmonary hypertension respectfully are successful these would be the first two drugs ever approved for those indications next quarter we will also commence enrollment of our sapphire study of enos gene therapy for group  pulmonary hypertension and we will commence enrollment of our accelerated approval study of dinutuximab for small cell lung cancer following on the small cell lung cancer development in our pipeline will be registration studies of dinutuximab for several other poorly treated gdexpressing cancers such as ovarian cancer and several sarcomas our pipeline also includes several novel drug device combination products such as the remosynch implantable pump systems which now has a pdufa countdown to april  of next year and the remunity disposable pump system which is on schedule for  approval we have also continued to rapidly progress our painfree transdermal remodulin prodrug system called remopro and remain on schedule to launch that product by the end of  let me wrapup the introduction with a word or two about payers while we have long given our drugs for free to anyone who could not pay for them the number of patients receiving our drugs for free does not exceed  of the total patient count we believe the reason for this is that we have excellent relations with payers and we expect this to carry over to the launch of generics in the coming years for example payers appreciate the fact that we have imposed no remodulin price increases upon them at all for over five years as compared to the generic companies that we have recently read about in the news who jack up their prices after offering initial discounts payers have been well educated by physicians that there are numerous medically important reasons to reimburse remodulin as prescribed for the fragile class iii and class iv new york heart association patients for whom it is their last resort before lung transplant hence we remain confident that remodulin tyvaso sales will continue to grow even if generic products are launched operator you may please open the phone for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from geoff meacham of barclays your line is open evan seigerman hi all this is evan seigerman on for geoff thanks for taking my question my question focuses on the remosynch with the pdufa in april is this pdufa date specifically for your drug component of the device or is it the drug device component and what have you been doing to prepare for the launch of this to make sure that patients are able to get it as soon as launched thank you martine rothblatt yes evan great question so first of all that april  pdufa date would be for that medtronic catheter which is necessary for the remosynch system to work and there are two possibilities in terms of what would be the approval date for the drug device combination which would be our nda would be a drug device combination and the fda did specifically want it to be an nda so the first possibility is during the sixmonth review period of the medtronic catheter the fda will ask us to allow us to complete the information that they requested in the complete response letter so that at the same day that they approve the medtronic catheter that at the same time we could get the approval of the nda for the remosynch drug device combination and that would be the result of discussions between the fda staff and our company i have no insight into whether that pathway would be successful or not it clearly has the advantage of simplicity reducing some drag on the fdas time and simplicity for people and the patients being able to get the implantable pump sooner than otherwise however if that pathway does not occur then what ends up happening is we after the medtronic pma is approved on their catheter then we have  days period for the fda to review our resubmitted nda with the benefit based on the approved pma for medtronic and that doesnt require a whole six months pdufa date that is a type of response im sorry i always get them mixed up whether it is type  or type  but it is one of those two type type  things that suggest a day turnaround and so like the outset of planning dates for our launch of the remosynch system is june  and it is – i would say – maybe i will push that till the end of june because if the medtronic pma is approved on april  then we would be a week or two to just wrap all that information into our resubmission of the nda of the complete response information so maybe it would be  days from the end of april but in any event it is looking stronger than ever and better than ever now for being able to launch the remosynch system in the first half of  now what we have done is weve – weve done a lot of interesting restructuring of our sales and marketing forces you may recall previously we had two differently branded sales teams a one biotechnology sales team and united therapeutics branded sales team now we just have one single united therapeutics branded sales team that provide physicians with a complete continuum of care package starting with adcirca orenitram and then tyvaso and remodulin so by creating this much more streamlined comprehensive sales force we were also able to develop a kind of early entry sales team to prepare the market for our next products which are right around the corner as you heard in my opening remarks weve got quite a number of products in our pipeline and we expect every  to  months there to be additional launches either of new labels or new products that will affect us so this team – this new team is specifically focused on preparing for rapid launches of all new products and they consist of some of the best and most experienced people we have so there will be a very rapid launch on remosynch now i myself was frankly a little bit pleasantly surprised in speaking with physicians i thought like if a patient – i thought it would be mostly like new patients going on remosynch and the ones that were already on the exvivo pump system that we have today would kind of stay with what they are because the patients are very fragile i always hear so much that nobody wants to change the therapy and anyway you dont want to touch and mess around with whats not broken however the way the physicians that i have all spoken with look at it is different for remosynch they feel that first of all its the exact same drug remodulin and the safety record on remosynch is extraordinary we beat our pvalue on safety by more than the order of magnitude so the benefits to the patients are huge in terms of their quality of life and stuff like that as i mentioned in my introductory remarks unfortunately pulmonary hypertension right now is an insidiously progressive disease were doing everything we can to come up with new cures like our gene therapy and whatnot but right now it is progressive and so when you are on your last line of therapy you want that experience to be as good as possible and the implantable experience is far and above superior to having a pump and a catheter dangling outside of your body so their attitude is actually to call patients in and offer to transition them from the exvivo system to the implantable system and in addition the newly – the patients who are newly failing the oral therapies would – i thought that they would actually – first that they would just go right to the remosynch but actually they will start on remodulin exvivo for a short period of time just to make sure that that patient has no intolerance to remodulin as a drug and then after a period of maybe anywhere from a week to two months they would be moved onto the implantable system so the exvivo remodulin system has a very important role to play as a bridge to the remosynch system i think for many years into the future next question operator our next question comes from liana moussatos of wedbush your line is open liana moussatos thank you for taking my question when we start seeing data from the new pipeline for dinutuximab and for the groups   and  pulmonary hypertension data releases start in  or  martine rothblatt yes let me pull out my pipeline chart here to give you the answer to that liana so i believe that the data on dinutuximab would start being visible in  and we would likely begin having some substudy and adapt the subgroup data available on southpaw on  so i think you are correct liana moussatos thank you martine rothblatt next question operator our next question comes from jessica fye of jpmorgan your line is open jessica fye hey there good morning thanks for taking my question i guess with lot of patients on oral prostacyclins for a longer period of time as you sort of indicated in your prepared remarks is it possible that once they progress those patients could end up skipping tyvaso and go straight on to remodulin ie is that possible that that group youre describing as the tyvaso backlog could be more of a remodulin or remosynch kind of backlog and how should we think about the timeframe within which this backlog will start kind of flowing back through the numbers thank you martine rothblatt yes very great question so its a diverse population and every patients got a diverse history with the disease i think there will be patients that will skip over on – over tyvaso and i think there will be other patients that will be – do everything they can to basically resist going on quoteunquote the indiscernible whether its implacable or otherwise the backlog is large enough that its going to forecast significant growth for both tyvaso and for remodulin historically about half of the patients have gone from oral directly to remodulin and about half of the patients have gone from oral to tyvaso so now that youve got this baloney number of patients who are cycling through the oral i think youre going to see the same experience of half of them going to one and half of them going to the other next question operator our next question comes from john scotti of evercore isi your line is open regina grebla hi good morning this is regina grebla for john so i had a question here your q now lists phase iii for treprostinil in liver transplant patients can you give us a little bit more color on this program and we know youre working on organ manufacturing so should we assume that your phase iii now ties into your organ program thank you martine rothblatt yeah very good question we do have an additional phase iii development of treprostinil in liver transplant and thats followed from phase ii study that we completed about year and half ago or so that was a single standard study up at university of pittsburgh medical center and the results were very encouraging with the role of prostacyclin being one that seems to mitigate against the reperfusion injury which is – which is frequently a cause of a worse outcome in liver transplant so our decision to move forward on rd spending on that into the phase iii is indeed as you said justified by our growing footprint in transplant i didnt mention it as one of the fixed phase iii trials upfront because we kind of break our work down to material and nonmaterial programs and because the patients who would use remodulin in a transplant setting will use it transiently maybe like a week of drugs something like that its not going to end up being a material contributor to revenues as an indication per se but what it does do is it further expands the united therapeutics footprint in the transplant groups at each of the major medical centers who are also very much the same groups that we work with for our exvivo lung perfusion products where we are able to take lungs and through our strategic investment in transmedics kidneys and hearts as well and provide marginal organs that are not immediately transplantable with a period of exvivo perfusion and then the data has shown and been peerreviewed published that with just four hours of exvivo perfusion about half the time organs that are not good enough for transplant are good enough for transplant and the one year of survival data on those patients has been indistinguishable from organs that do not go through exvivo perfusion so yes it is all part of this strategic placement of resources of united therapeutics into the transplantation stage which we would hope to be a material revenue contributor in the s next question operator our next question comes from the line of chris shibutani of cowen and company your line is open chris shibutani thank you three quick questions if i could you mentioned in your prepared remarks about rd expenses obviously we have kind of pushes and pulls with the freedomev study continuing but expected to wrap up but then many of the pipeline efforts can you give us some sense for the scale in the stepup that you are describing second question would be on the pump itself recognizing that medtronics pump business is currently under consent decree can you confirm that this consent decree would need to be released in order for the implantable pump to become commercially available or not thank you martine rothblatt okay so lets see if i got it all let me go in reverse order so first of all the consent decree does not need to be released in order for the implantable pump to be approved and for our remosynch product so unambiguous does not pretty much one thing has nothing to do with the other and it simply relates to procedures within medtronic for releasing of pumps to patients but does not affect the regulatory approval process at all i think the next question was if i could give you some kind of gauge of the increase in rd spending based on the chris shibutani magnitude and trajectory yeah the rd based upon everything you described at science day and pushes and pulls with freedomev ramping up martine rothblatt yes i appreciate the question but im going to kind of stick with my introductory remarks that rd spending is going to increase we have gone from one phase iii study to six phase iii studies and we have gone kind of from one drug device development to multiple drug device combination developments being accelerated in different ways but i am absolutely positive that the increase in rd spending will not impact upon united therapeutics being a very very profitable company next question operator our next question comes from terence flynn of goldman sachs your line is open samir siddhanti this is samir on for terence thanks very much for taking the question just one question from the q can you offer any additional details on why you think the launch of steadymeds trevyent could prevent you from launching remunity or remosynch or did we incorrectly interpret that language thanks so much martine rothblatt yeah well i think you probably read it in the risk factors where pretty much every possibility in the world is listed but there is a point of view – and i will just call it a point of view its not one that i subscribe to – that the steadymed product if approved by the fda because of its orphan drug designation status would impede our ability to offer the remunity product but so thats a point of view so we have got to disclose it in the risk factors i personally think it makes no sense that the two technologies are extremely different i mean different like day and night at the science day you heard – i think you and i met each other there you heard some of the scientific presentations on why we are very skeptical that the steadymed product will offer any relief from pain associated with the transdermal pain associated with the treprostinil molecule there is one technology that steadymed uses for their device the remunity product uses an entirely different technology the acoustic wave sensing technology is a fundamental breakthrough in continuous drug delivery technology by the genius dean kamen who has been investing in this field since autoeject in the s and the minimed technology and then the medtronic and now this next quantum leap with the acoustic wave sensing technology so i think that the therapeutic and clinical advantages of the two technologies and their side effect profile are so different – as different as night and day – that this is not at all what the orphan drug act was intended to block what the orphan drug act was intended to block is basically a generic company coming in with a copy of something that an innovator worked very hard to get approved for an orphan population and that if it did not stop somebody else coming in with a different drug even a slightly different drug even a slightly different delivered version of the same drug for that same orphan indication so the orphan drug act is a rampup its not a blockade and i think it would be very odd and highly unlikely for it to be used as a blockade in this case we have time operator for one last question operator thank you our last question comes from michael yee of rbc capital markets your line is open unidentified participant this is edwin ph on for mike thanks for taking my questions could you please share some details of the fda cio you received response on implantable remodulin anything else do you need to address other than the pump approval maybe youll respond the nda after april  is that right and similarly how about the development and timeline of deka whats the differentiation from the implantable pumps from medtronic thank you martine rothblatt thank you for your questions so the answer to the first question is that there is nothing else that will be needed for full approval and commercial launch of the remosynch product following on the april pdufa of the pma from medtronic on the catheter and then the drug device combination nda approval for united therapeutics which simply involves responding to the complete response letter the main point of which was that first they had to approve the medtronic catheter before they could approve our drug in combination with the catheter that would be a type  response which is just  days after april so pretty much the outside date we are looking at is the end of june and there is kind of a best case that we could get everything approved at the same time in middle of april but thats it no other approval is needed for remosynch with regard to the deka technology we – i mentioned in my last call that we have accelerated the number of different elements of that and without delving into sort of proprietary details i will say that we are doing everything necessary to secure a launch of that product in  and i think we have multiple parallel avenues to ensure that has the highest probability of occurring launching after  and then just so people dont get confused there has been a nextgeneration version of that deka pump with a nextgeneration version of the treprostinil molecule which we call remopro and this is a version of the treprostinil molecule that impedes the portions of the molecule that causes pain in the transdermal tissue and then those additional atoms that we wrap around parts of the molecule that blocks the pain activation they are then rapidly metabolized in the serum so once that molecule gets into the bloodstream it looks just like plain old fashioned treprostinil and we feel confident that we will be able to work that approval out on the basis of a pharmacokinetic bioequivalent just as we got approval for intravenous remodulin and the bioequivalence through compared to the subcutaneous remodulin and that program is on track for  approval so there is – drug device approvals that we are looking at every year    each one welcoming more and more patients than from this large backlog of patients we expect to be failing the oral therapies martine rothblatt all right everybody well thank you very much for participating in our conference call this morning james and i will be – next healthcare conference will be at jpmorgan and we look

entrepreneur and medical ethicist martine rothblatt discusses the future of artificial consciousness by martine rothblatt martine rothblatt is a lawyer entrepreneur medical ethicist and the author of virtually human the promiseand the perilof digital immortality author virtually human write a comment credit getty images in the book virtually human the promiseand the perilof digital immortality martine rothblatt explores the scientific and ethical consequences of artificial consciousness in the following edited excerpt she outlines how biotech companies are producing empathetic robots to take the place of human assistants biotechnology companies are well aware that over  percent of an average persons lifetime medical expenditures are spent during the very last portion of their life lives are priceless and hence we deploy the best technology we can to mechanically keep people alive medical cyberconscious mind support is the next logical step in our efforts to keep endstage patients alive the potential profits from such technology health insurance would pay for it just like any other form of medically necessary equipment are an irresistible enticement for companies to allocate top people to the effort consequently brainmapping projects are among the largest joint governmentindustry biotech projects in both europe and the united states healthcare needs for older people are also driving efforts to develop the empathetic branch of cyberconsciousness there are not enough people to provide caring attention to the growing legion of senior citizens as countries grow wealthy their people live longer their birthrates decline below the replacement rate and consequently their senior citizens compose an everlarger percentage of the population today there are five younger people to care for each older person whereas in four decades there will be just two workers to care for each older person there is a huge healthcare industry motivation to develop empathetic robots because a minority of young people actually want to take care of older people the seniors wont want to be manhandled nor will their offspring want to be guiltridden other than importing help from developing countrieswhich only postpones the issue briefly as those countries have gestating dependency ratio problems of their ownthere is no solution but for the empathetic autonomous robot grandma and grandpa needand deservean attentive caring interesting person with whom to interact the only such persons that can be summoned into existence to meet this demand are manufactured software persons with robotic bodies ie empathetic autonomous robots with a physicality that mimics a fleshandblood person companies are putting expressionfilled faces on their robots and filling their code with the art of conversation there is much debate over whether the expressionfilled faces of digital healthcare assistants should be humanlike dueling robot scientists from japan have taken opposing positions on the uncanny valley hypothesis the uncanny valley is a posited sociopsychological threshold people like expressionfilled robots until they look too human and then they freak people out masahiro mori believes that when they get too close to lifelike without attaining it what was endearing becomes repellent fast whereas hiroshi ishiguro is interested in pushing not just technological envelopes but philosophical ones as well his androids are cognitive trial balloons imperfect mirrors designed to reveal what is fundamentally human by creating ever more accurate approximations observing how we react to them and exploiting that response to fashion something even more convincing my experience leads me to believe that the uncanny valley is a myth i have not seen anyone repelled by the verisimilitude of bina the humanoid robot based on my wife bina aspen after hours of interviews the informationtechnology industry itself is working on cyberconsciousness ibm is sponsoring the blue brain project of henry markram which is using supercomputer resources to create functional digital simulacra of portions of animal and human brains the mantra of it is userfriendly and there is nothing friendlier than a person a cyberconscious house that we could speak to prepare something id like for dinner turn on a movie id like is a product people would be willing to pay a lot of money for its getting closer the nest protect is a smoke and carbonmonoxide alarm that talks to you in a calm human voice to warn of smoke or carbon dioxide in a room before sounding a loud alarm users cant talk back yet but they can wave their hand to silence the alarm if its simply a matter of burning the roast a personal digital assistant that is smart selfaware and servile will outcompete in the marketplace pdas that are deaf dumb and demanding in short it companies have immense financial incentives to make software as personable as possible they are responding to these incentives by allocating floors of programmers to the cyberconsciousness task thats one reason why in december  google hired wisely in my opinion master inventor ray kurzweil the author of how to create a mind as its director of engineering in  the company bought boston dynamics a major player in the robotics industry and in janaury  google acquired british artificialintelligence company deepmind for about  million note how rapidly programmers have arrogated into their programs the human pronoun i until cyberconsciousness began emerging no one but humans and fictional characters could call themselves i suddenly bits and building blocks of vitology are saying how may i help you im sorry youre having difficulty ill transfer you to a human operator right away the programmers will have succeeded in birthing cyberconsciousness when they figure out how to make the human operator totally unnecessary from their progress to date this seems to be the goal add to this darwinian code and conscious vitology has arrived a sixth and perhaps ultimate group devoting itself to creating conscious vitology is the maker movement a grassroots movement of people devoted to bridging the gap between software and physical objects arose in the early years of the twentyfirst century they call themselves makers and come together annually in different cities around the world at annual maker faires and related local gatherings bina attends the vermont maker faire where she is one of the most popular exhibitors conversing with all who stroll by amid a veritable sea of homemade robots and dprinted objects of every sort empowered by twentydollar computer boards called arduinos that can be simply programmed to do almost anything eg a plant can tweet via an arduino in its soil when it needs water the makers are passionate about building bridges between the virtual and real worlds dramatically dropping prices for d printers enable makers to envision printing bodies for minds and a culture of opensource software lets the makers rapidly share and improve their mindware there is nothing cooler to make than a person and nothing happens faster than when countless thousands of people crowdsource solutions it is perhaps unsurprising that the economist has called the maker movement the harbinger of a new industrial revolution not unlike the original industrial revolution grew out of
