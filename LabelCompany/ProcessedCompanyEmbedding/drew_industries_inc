industries incorporated drew and collectively with its subsidiaries the company through its whollyowned subsidiary lippert components inc and its subsidiaries collectively lippert components or lci supplies a broad array of components for the leading original equipment manufacturers oems of recreational vehicles rvs and adjacent industries including buses trailers used to haul boats livestock equipment and other cargo pontoon boats manufactured homes modular housing and factorybuilt mobile office units the company also supplies components to the related aftermarkets of these industries primarily by selling to retail dealers wholesale distributors and service centers at june   the company operated  manufacturing and distribution facilities located throughout the united states and in canada and italy the company previously had two reportable segments the recreational vehicle products segment the rv segment and the manufactured housing products segment the mh segment the company has recently increased its focus on the significant opportunities in the aftermarket for its products primarily sales to retail dealers wholesale distributors and service centers additionally over the past several years sales of components for manufactured homes have become a smaller part of the companys business largely due to the growth the company has experienced with respect to its components sold to customers for traditional recreational vehicles as well as the expanded use of its components in other nonrv applications which we refer to as adjacent industries unit growth for mh segment products has also been lower over the last decade primarily due to the current real estate credit and economic environment including the availability of site built homes at stable prices and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for sitebuilt homes and loans for manufactured homes in response to these changes in the companys business subsequent to march   the company modified its internal reporting structure reflecting a change in how its chief operating decision maker codm assesses the performance of the companys operating results and make decisions about resource allocations the companys new reportable segments are the oem segment and the aftermarket segment intersegment sales are insignificant net sales and operating profit were as follows for the

adjacent industries primarily to retail dealers wholesale distributors and service centers the aftermarket segment also includes the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims most industries where the company sells products or where its products are used historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate accordingly the companys sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter however because of fluctuations in dealer inventories the impact of international national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of rvs and other products for which the company sells its components the timing of dealer orders and the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industrywide shipments from time to time current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years additionally sale of components to the aftermarket channels of these industries tend to be counterseasonal industry background oem recreational vehicle industry an rv is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational camping travel or seasonal use rvs may be motorized motorhomes or towable travel trailers fifthwheel travel trailers folding camping trailers and truck campers rv dealers seasonally increasing inventory levels by an estimated  units in the first six months of  higher than the increase in inventory levels of  units in the first six months of  while the company measures its oem segment rv sales against industrywide wholesale shipment statistics the underlying health of the rv industry is determined by retail demand a comparison of the number of units and the yearoveryear percentage change in industrywide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailers and fifthwheel rvs as reported by statistical surveys inc as well as the resulting estimated change in dealer inventories for both the united states and canada is as follows drew industries incorporated item   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued estimated wholesale retail unit impact on units change units change dealer inventories quarter ended june        quarter ended march        quarter ended december        quarter ended september        twelve

has not been published therefore retail and dealer inventory data includes a company estimate for retail units sold in june according to the rvia industrywide wholesale shipments of motorhome rvs in the first six months of  increased  percent to  units compared to the same period of  the company estimates retail demand for motorhome rvs increased six percent in the first six months of  adjacent industries the companys portfolio of products used in rvs can also be used in other applications including buses trailers used to haul boats livestock equipment and other cargo pontoon boats manufactured homes modular housing and factorybuilt mobile office units collectively adjacent industries in many cases oem customers of the adjacent industries are affiliated with rv oems through related subsidiaries the company believes there are significant opportunities in these adjacent industries and as a result four of the last six business acquisitions completed by the company were focused in adjacent industries the estimated potential content per unit the company may supply to the adjacent industries varies by oem product and differs from rvs and motorhomes as a means to understand the potential of each of these markets management reviews the number of retail units sold the following are key target markets for adjacent industries component sales enclosed trailers according to statistical surveys approximately  and  enclosed trailers were sold in  and  respectively drew industries incorporated item   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued pontoon boats statistical surveys also reported approximately  and  pontoon boats were sold in  and  respectively school buses according to wards communications and rl polk  co there were approximately  and  school buses sold in  and  respectively manufactured housing according to the institute for building technology and safety there were approximately  and  manufactured home wholesale shipments in  and  respectively aftermarket many of the companys oem segment products are also sold through various aftermarket channels including dealerships warehouse distributors and service centers as well as direct to retail customers the company has teams dedicated to product training and marketing support for its aftermarket customers the company also supports two call centers to provide quick responses to customers for both product delivery and technical support this support is designed for a rapid response to critical repairs so customer downtime is minimized the aftermarket segment also includes the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims many of the optional upgrades and noncritical replacements are purchased outside the normal product selling seasons thereby causing aftermarket sales to be counterseasonal following the last recession approximately  million rvs have been built and sold bringing current estimated rv ownership up to nearly nine million units according to the rvia additionally as a result of a vibrant secondary market onethird of current owners purchased their rv new while the remaining twothirds purchased a previously owned rv this vibrant secondary market is a key driver for the aftermarket as the company anticipates owners of previously owned rvs will likely upgrade their units as well as replace parts and accessories which have been subjected to normal wear and tear results of operations consolidated highlights consolidated net sales in the second quarter of  increased to  million  percent higher than the  second quarter the increase in year over year net sales reflects industrywide growth in wholesale shipments of towable rvs by oems which increased by  percent in the second quarter of  enhanced by acquisitions completed by the company over the twelve months ended june   as well as the july  distribution and supply agreement for premium electronics with furrion which together added  million in net sales in the second quarter of  oem segment net sales increased  percent or  million while aftermarket segment net sales increased  percent or  million compared to the second quarter of  for the second quarter of  the companys net income increased to  million or  per diluted share up from net income of  million or  per diluted share in the second quarter of  consolidated operating profits increased to  million in the second quarter of  from  million in the second quarter of  operating profit margin increased to  percent in the second quarter of  from  percent in the second quarter of  the increased profitability is the result of several factors primarily including higher sales leading to better overhead utilization the impact of lower material costs accretive acquisitions in both  and  cost management initiatives and changes in product sales mix including growth in the aftermarket the company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure the company seeks to continuously manage its labor cost particularly indirect labor while supporting the growth of the business lean manufacturing teams continue working to reduce cost and implement processes to better utilize available floorspace the company has also reduced direct labor attrition which improves efficiency and reduces other costs associated with workforce turnover raw material costs continue to fluctuate and are expected to remain volatile in particular the cost of aluminum and steel used in certain of the companys manufactured components dropped during the second half of  and reached significant low points however certain of these prices increased in the second quarter of  from those low points experienced during  thus far in  the company completed three acquisitions all of which have been accretive to earnings project  srl  an italian manufacturer of innovative spacesaving bed lifts and retractable steps with estimated annual sales of  million us

companys net sales growth in components for travel trailer and fifthwheel rvs during the second quarter of  exceeded the increase in industrywide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifthwheel rvs during the same period this is the combined result of organic sales growth acquisitions completed in  and increased unit sales of fifthwheel travel trailers which typically contain more content per unit fifthwheel unit sales in the second quarter of  increased by  units over the second quarter of  the companys net sales growth in components for motorhomes during the second quarter of  exceeded the increase in industrywide wholesale shipments of motorhomes during the same period primarily due to market share gains and acquisitions over the past few years the company has been expanding its product line of components for motorhomes in order to increase its customer base and market penetration and further growth is expected drew industries incorporated item   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the trend in the companys average product content per rv produced is an indicator of the companys overall market share of components for new rvs the companys average product content per type of rv calculated based upon the companys net sales of components to rv oems for the different types of rvs produced for

opportunities in adjacent industries operating profit of the oem segment was  million in the second quarter of  an improvement of  million compared to the second quarter of  the operating profit margin of the oem segment in the second quarter of  was positively impacted by increasing sales to adjacent industries oems lower material costs for certain raw materials after increasing in the latter part of  steel and aluminum costs declined in the second half of  and continued into  costs for these commodities experienced some increases since the beginning of  material costs which are subject to global supply and demand forces are expected to remain volatile sales mix changes of its products including increased sales of fifthwheel products indirect labor cost savings initiated in the fourth quarter of  to reduce such costs on an annualized basis investments over the past several years to increase capacity and improve operating efficiencies further the company has implemented efficiency improvements including lean manufacturing initiatives increased use of automation and employee retention initiatives the company has also reduced direct labor attrition which improves efficiency and reduces other costs associated with workforce turnover lower group health and workers compensation claims the company actively works to manage and reduce these costs however these costs remain subject to fluctuation partially offset by fixed costs which were approximately  million higher than in the second quarter of  over the past couple of years the company made significant investments in manufacturing capacity both facilities and personnel to prepare for the expected increase in net sales in  and beyond in addition to investments in fixed costs to expand manufacturing capacity the company has made improvements in marketing human resources engineering customer service and other critical departments the company also added the teams from acquired businesses as well amortization costs of intangible assets related to those businesses while the company seeks to continuously manage its labor cost it has added staff to support the growth of the business the results

housing industries as well as other industries where the company sells products or where its products are used historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate accordingly the companys sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter however because of fluctuations in dealer inventories and the impact of international national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of rvs and other products for which the company sells its components current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years industry background recreational vehicle industry an rv is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational camping travel

association rvia industrywide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifthwheel rvs the companys primary rv markets increased  percent in the first six months of  to  units compared to the first

by an estimated  more units in the first half of  than in the first half of  in anticipation of strong retail demand drew industries incorporated item   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the annual sales cycle for the rv industry has historically started in october after the open house in elkhart indiana where rv oems display product to rv retail dealers and ended after the conclusion of the summer selling season in september between october and march industrywide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifthwheel rvs have historically exceeded retail sales and between april and september the spring and summer selling seasons retail sales of travel trailer and fifthwheel rvs have historically exceeded industrywide wholesale shipments most industry analysts report dealer inventories of travel trailer and fifthwheel rvs are inline with anticipated retail demand while the company measures its rv sales against industrywide wholesale shipment statistics the underlying health of the rv industry is determined by retail demand a comparison of the number of units and the yearoveryear percentage change in industrywide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailer and fifthwheel rvs as reported by statistical surveys inc as well as the resulting change in dealer inventories for both the united states and canada is as follows estimated wholesale retail unit impact on units change units change dealer inventories quarter ended june          quarter ended march          quarter ended december

industrywide wholesale shipments of motorhome rvs in the first six months of  increased  percent to  units compared to the same period of  the company estimates retail demand for motorhome rvs increased  percent in the first six months of  as a result of the slower than expected start to  due to severe weather conditions a spring which was slow to arrive and a shortage of drivers to deliver finished goods industrywide inventory seasonally accumulated however recent trends appear to have eased concerns surrounding dealer inventory rv oems and dealers are reporting retail sales have picked up in recent months an improvement from the relatively flat yearoveryear retail sales reported through may  due to pentup demand stemming from the prolonged winter and that inventories of rvs are in line with anticipated retail demand retail sales of rvs historically have been closely tied to general economic conditions as well as consumer confidence which was recently reported at its highest level since january  retail sales in the traditionally strong summer selling season will be a key indicator of consumer demand for rvs in  while production over the last several quarters was strong unless retail demand matches these production levels dealers could reduce the pace of their orders and our customers the oems would need to adjust their production levels in future months in may  the rvia projected an  percent increase in industrywide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifthwheel rvs for  to  the company is also encouraged that several customers are introducing new product lines as well as increasing production capacity several industry analysts also report that the rv industry may benefit in the coming years from the release of pentup demand resulting from the recession and the growing popularity of the rv lifestyle the company also remains confident in its ability to exceed industry growth rates through new product introductions market share gains acquisitions and ongoing investments in research and development engineering quality and customer service drew industries incorporated item   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued over the long term the company expects rv industry sales to be aided by positive demographics and the continued popularity of the rv lifestyle further the number of consumers between the ages of  and  will total  million by   percent higher than in  according to us census figures and one in ten vehicleowning households between the ages of  and  own at least one rv further the rvia has an advertising campaign promoting the rv lifestyle the current campaign is targeted at both parents aged  with children at home as well as couples aged  with no children at home the popularity of traveling in rvs to nascar and other sporting events more familyoriented domestic vacations and using rvs as second homes also appear to motivate consumer demand for rvs rvia studies indicate that rv vacations cost significantly less than other forms of vacation more details can be found at wwwrviacom manufactured housing industry manufactured homes are built entirely in a factory on permanent steel undercarriages or chassis to which axles and wheels are attached the homes are then transported to a manufactured housing dealer which sells and transports the home to the buyers home site the manufactured home is installed pursuant to a federal building code administered by the us department of housing and urban development hud the federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and construction methods to site and secure the home at a home site strength and durability transportability fire resistance energy efficiency and quality the hud code also sets performance standards for the heating plumbing air conditioning thermal and electrical systems it is the only federally regulated national building code manufactured homes contain one or more floors or sections which can be joined to make larger homes a typical section may range in size from  to  square feet during the first six months of  multisection homes were  percent of the total manufactured homes produced consistent with  but down from the  percent of the total manufactured homes produced between  and  multisection manufactured homes contain more of the companys products than singlesection manufactured homes the institute for building technology and safety ibts reported that for the first six months of  industrywide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes were  units an increase of  percent compared to the first six months of  for the  years prior to the subprime boom in home financing manufactured housing industrywide wholesale shipments represented  percent or more of singlefamily housing starts during the subprime years  to  when extremely low cost loans were available for financing purchases of sitebuilt homes many traditional buyers of manufactured homes were able to purchase sitebuilt homes instead of manufactured homes and manufactured housings share of the singlefamily market dropped precipitously to below  percent since the subprime bubble burst in  and  this market share has averaged about  percent despite interest rates for manufactured home loans remaining historically high relative to interest rates for sitebuilt home loans accordingly the company believes the manufactured housing industry may begin to experience a modest recovery when the economy improves and home buyers begin to look for affordable housing however because of the current real estate credit and economic environment including the availability of foreclosed site built homes at low prices fluctuating consumer confidence and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for sitebuilt homes and loans for manufactured homes the company expects industrywide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes to remain low until these conditions improve in addition certain provisions of the recently enacted doddfrank act which regulate financial transactions could make certain types of mortgages including chattel loans more difficult to obtain  in particular those historically used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes although new legislation has been introduced to address this matter and the bureau of consumer financial protection is reviewing this matter there can be no assurance of the outcome nevertheless the company believes that longterm growth prospects for manufactured housing remain positive because of i the quality and affordability of the home ii favorable demographic trends including the increasing number of retirees who in the past had represented a significant market for manufactured homes and iii pentup demand by retirees who could potentially purchase a manufactured home but have been unable or unwilling to sell their primary residence at current market prices drew industries
