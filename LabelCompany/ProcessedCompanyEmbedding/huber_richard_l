aetnafebruary  life at aetna inc certainly was not boring during the five years that the toughtalking hardcharging richard l huber was chief executivehe led the company through rapid expansion dropping and adding products and purchasing us healthcare nylcare and prudential healthcare to make aetna the nations largest managedcare company he was determined to make aetna a major international playerfor the record  correction published the tuesday editorial changing the guard at aetna was in error when it said that richard l huber was the companys chief executive for five years he became ceo in mr huber was a rarity among hartford corporate leaders in more ways than one he lived in the city and invested here by buying property he and his wife participated in the social and cultural life of the community he was accessible but he also caused sparks to fly with his attempts to unload the moneylosing civic center mall on the companys terms and against city halls wishesas aetnas chief mr huber had two things going against him his abrasive personality and the publics growing unhappiness with the health insurance industry particularly hmoshe may have been able to survive the flak that his combative style attracted as well as the assault on hmos by politicians trial lawyers and doctors among others but he could not survive the  percent plunge in aetnas stock price during the past year  due in no small part to aetnas being the target of classaction lawsuits and the poor performance of prudential healthcarelast week he resigned at the request of the companys board of directors as if any hmo company doesnt have enough public relations problems aetna had to bear the burden of mr hubers sharp tongue last year a day after a california woman won a  million judgment against aetna for delaying care for her husband before he died of cancer the aetna chief said the award was the work of a skillful ambulancechasing lawyer a politically motivated judge and a weeping widow mr huber later apologizedmr hubers departure will not solve aetnas problems which in key respects mirror the challenges faced by all health insurance companies americans insist on getting the best health care in the world but they dont want to pay for it through higher taxes and premiums in mr hubers flamboyant words if you pay for a chevy you dont get a cadillac weve accustomed ourselves to feeling that no matter what you pay you get a cadillaclongtime aetna director william h donaldson was chosen by the insurance giants board to succeed mr huber among the new chairmans impressive credentials he is the cofounder of the investment banking firm of donaldson lufkin  jenrette and was chairman and ceo of the new york stock exchangemr donaldson has the best wishes of everyone in
