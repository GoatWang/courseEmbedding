may  –  february  was a german composer theatre director polemicist and conductor who is primarily known for his operas or as some of his later works were later known music dramas unlike most opera composers wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of weber and meyerbeer wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the gesamtkunstwerk total work of art by which he sought to synthesise the poetic visual musical and dramatic arts with music subsidiary to drama he described this vision in a series of essays published between  and  wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen the ring of the nibelung his compositions particularly those of his later period are notable for their complex textures rich harmonies and orchestration and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters places ideas or plot elements his advances in musical language such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres greatly influenced the development of classical music his tristan und isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music wagner had his own opera house built the bayreuth festspielhaus which embodied many novel design features the ring and parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual bayreuth festival run by his descendants his thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works including die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg until his final years wagners life was characterised by political exile turbulent love affairs poverty and repeated flight from his creditors his controversial writings on music drama and politics have attracted extensive comment notably since the late th century where they express antisemitic sentiments the effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts throughout the th century his

family lived at no  the brühl the house of the red and white lions in the jewish quarter he was baptized at st thomas church he was the ninth child of carl friedrich wagner who was a clerk in the leipzig police service and his wife johanna rosine née paetz the daughter of a bakern  wagners father carl died of typhus six months after richards birth afterwards his mother johanna lived with carls friend the actor and playwright ludwig geyer in august  johanna and geyer probably married—although no documentation of this has been found in the leipzig church registers she and her family moved to geyers residence in dresden until he was fourteen wagner was known as wilhelm richard geyer he almost certainly thought that geyer was his biological father geyers love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson and wagner took part in his performances in his autobiography mein leben wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel in late  wagner was enrolled at pastor wetzels school at possendorf near dresden where he received some piano instruction from his latin teacher he struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear following geyers death in  richard was sent to the kreuzschule the boarding school of the dresdner kreuzchor at the expense of geyers brother at the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the gothic elements of carl maria von webers opera der freischütz which he saw weber conduct at this period wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright his first creative effort listed in the wagnerwerkverzeichnis the standard listing of wagners works as wwv  was a tragedy called leubald begun when he was in school in  the play was strongly influenced by shakespeare and goethe wagner was determined to set it to music and persuaded his family to allow him music lessonsn  by  the family had returned to leipzig wagners first lessons in harmony were taken during – with christian gottlieb müller in january  he first heard beethovens th symphony and then in march the same composers th symphony both at the gewandhaus beethoven became a major inspiration and wagner wrote a piano transcription of the th symphony he was also greatly impressed by a performance of mozarts requiem wagners early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period in  he saw a performance by dramatic soprano wilhelmine schröderdevrient and she became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera in mein leben wagner wrote when i look back across my entire life i find no event to place beside this in the impression it produced on me and claimed that the profoundly human and ecstatic performance of this incomparable artist kindled in him an almost demonic firen  in  wagner enrolled at the leipzig university where he became a member of the saxon student fraternity he took composition lessons with the thomaskantor theodor weinlig weinlig was so impressed with wagners musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons he arranged for his pupils piano sonata in bflat major which was consequently dedicated to him to be published as wagners op  a year later wagner composed his symphony in c major a beethovenesque work performed in prague in  and at the leipzig gewandhaus in  he then began to work on an opera die hochzeit the wedding which he never completed early career and marriage –edit wilhelmine minna planer  by alexander von otterstedt in  wagners brother albert managed to obtain for him a position as choir master at the theatre in würzburg in the same year at the age of  wagner composed his first complete opera die feen the fairies this work which imitated the style of weber went unproduced until half a century later when it was premiered in munich shortly after the composers death in  having returned to leipzig in  wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in magdeburg during which he wrote das liebesverbot the ban on love based on shakespeares measure for measure this was staged at magdeburg in  but closed before the second performance this together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him left the composer in bankruptcy wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at magdeburg the actress christine wilhelmine minna planer and after the disaster of das liebesverbot he followed her to königsberg where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre the two married in tragheim church on  november  in may  minna left wagner for another man and this was but only the first débâcle of a tempestuous marriage in june  wagner moved to riga then in the russian empire where he became music director of the local opera having in this capacity engaged minnas sister amalie also a singer for the theatre he presently resumed relations with minna during  by  the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled riga on the run from creditors debts would plague wagner for most of his life initially they took a stormy sea passage to london from which wagner drew the inspiration for his opera der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman with a plot based on a sketch by heinrich heine the wagners settled in paris in september  and stayed there until  wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as a pilgrimage to beethoven which sketched his growing concept of music drama and an end in paris where he depicts his own miseries as a german musician in the french metropolis he also provided arrangements of operas by other composers largely on behalf of the schlesinger publishing house during this stay he completed his third and fourth operas rienzi and der fliegende holländer dresden –edit wagner c  by ernest benedikt kietz wagner had completed rienzi in  with the strong support of giacomo meyerbeer it was accepted for performance by the dresden court theatre hofoper in the kingdom of saxony and in  wagner moved to dresden his relief at returning to germany was recorded in his autobiographic sketch of  where he wrote that en route from paris for the first time i saw the rhine—with hot tears in my eyes i poor artist swore eternal fidelity to my german fatherland rienzi was staged to considerable acclaim on  october wagner lived in dresden for the next six years eventually being appointed the royal saxon court conductor during this period he staged there der fliegende holländer  january  and tannhäuser  october  the first two of his three middleperiod operas wagner also mixed with artistic circles in dresden including the composer ferdinand hiller and the architect gottfried semper wagners involvement in leftwing politics abruptly ended his welcome in dresden wagner was active among socialist german nationalists there regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor august röckel and the russian anarchist mikhail bakunin he was also influenced by the ideas of pierrejoseph proudhon and ludwig feuerbach widespread discontent came to a head in  when the unsuccessful may uprising in dresden broke out in which wagner played a minor supporting role warrants were issued for the revolutionaries arrest wagner had to flee first visiting paris and then settling in zürichn  where he at first took refuge with a friend alexander müller in exile switzerland –edit warrant for the arrest of richard wagner issued on  may  wagner was to spend the next twelve years in exile from germany he had completed lohengrin the last of his middleperiod operas before the dresden uprising and now wrote desperately to his friend franz liszt to have it staged in his absence liszt conducted the premiere in weimar in august  nevertheless wagner was in grim personal straits isolated from the german musical world and without any regular income in  julie the wife of his friend karl ritter began to pay him a small pension which she maintained until  with help from her friend jessie laussot this was to have been augmented to an annual sum of  thalers per year but this plan was abandoned when wagner began an affair with mme laussot wagner even planned an elopement with her in  which her husband prevented meanwhile wagners wife minna who had disliked the operas he had written after rienzi was falling into a deepening depression wagner fell victim to illhealth according to ernest newman largely a matter of overwrought nerves which made it difficult for him to continue writingn  wagners primary published output during his first years in zürich was a set of essays in the artwork of the future  he described a vision of opera as gesamtkunstwerk total work of art in which the various arts such as music song dance poetry visual arts and stagecraft were unified judaism in music  was the first of wagners writings to feature antisemitic views in this polemic wagner argued frequently using traditional antisemitic abuse that jews had no connection to the german spirit and were thus capable of producing only shallow and artificial music according to him they composed music to achieve popularity and thereby financial success as opposed to creating genuine works of art in opera and drama  wagner described the aesthetics of drama that he was using to create the ring operas before leaving dresden wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen he initially wrote the libretto for a single opera siegfrieds tod siegfrieds death in  after arriving in zürich he expanded the story with the opera der junge siegfried young siegfried which explored the heros background he completed the text of the cycle by writing the libretti for die walküre the valkyrie and das rheingold the rhine gold and revising the other libretti to agree with his new concept completing them in  the concept of opera expressed in opera and drama and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written up to and including lohengrin partly in an attempt to explain his change of views wagner published in  the autobiographical a communication to my friends this contained his first public announcement of what was to become the ring cycle i shall never write an opera more as i have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works i will call them dramas  i propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas preceded by a lengthy prelude vorspiel  at a speciallyappointed festival i propose some future time to produce those three dramas with their prelude in the course of three days and a foreevening emphasis in original wagner began composing the music for das rheingold between november  and september  following it immediately with die walküre written between june  and march  he began work on the third ring opera which he now called simply siegfried probably in september  but by june  he had completed only the first two acts he decided to put the work aside to concentrate on a new idea tristan und isolde based on the arthurian love story tristan and iseult portrait of mathilde wesendonck  by karl ferdinand sohn one source of inspiration for tristan und isolde was the philosophy of arthur schopenhauer notably his the world as will and representation to which wagner had been introduced in  by his poet friend georg herwegh wagner later called this the most important event of his life his personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be schopenhauers philosophy a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition he remained an adherent of schopenhauer for the rest of his life one of schopenhauers doctrines was that music held a supreme role in the arts as a direct expression of the worlds essence namely blind impulsive will this doctrine contradicted wagners view expressed in opera and drama that the music in opera had to be subservient to the drama wagner scholars have argued that schopenhauers influence caused wagner to assign a more commanding role to music in his later operas including the latter half of the ring cycle which he had yet to composen  aspects of schopenhauerian doctrine found their way into wagners subsequent librettin  a second source of inspiration was wagners infatuation with the poetwriter mathilde wesendonck the wife of the silk merchant otto wesendonck wagner met the wesendoncks who were both great admirers of his music in zürich in  from may  onwards wesendonck made several loans to wagner to finance his household expenses in zürich and in  placed a cottage on his estate at wagners disposal which became known as the asyl asylum or place of rest during this period wagners growing passion for his patrons wife inspired him to put aside work on the ring cycle which was not resumed for the next twelve years and begin work on tristan while planning the opera wagner composed the wesendonck lieder five songs for voice and piano setting poems by mathilde two of these settings are explicitly subtitled by wagner as studies for tristan und isolde amongst the conducting engagements that wagner undertook for revenue during this period he gave several concerts in  with the london philharmonic society including one before queen victoria the queen enjoyed his tannhäuser overture and spoke with wagner after the concert writing of him in her diary that he was short very quiet wears spectacles  has a very finelydeveloped forehead a hooked nose  projecting chin in exile venice and paris –edit wagner in paris  wagners uneasy affair with mathilde collapsed in  when minna intercepted a letter to mathilde from him after the resulting confrontation with minna wagner left zürich alone bound for venice where he rented an apartment in the palazzo giustinian while minna returned to germany wagners attitude to minna had changed the editor of his correspondence with her john burk has said that she was to him an invalid to be treated with kindness and consideration but except at a distance was a menace to his peace of mind wagner continued his correspondence with mathilde and his friendship with her husband otto who maintained his financial support of the composer in an  letter to mathilde wagner wrote halfsatirically of tristan child this tristan is turning into something terrible this final act—i fear the opera will be banned  only mediocre performances can save me perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad in november  wagner once again moved to paris to oversee production of a new revision of tannhäuser staged thanks to the efforts of princess pauline von metternich whose husband was the austrian ambassador in paris the performances of the paris tannhäuser in  were a notable fiasco this was partly a consequence of the conservative tastes of the jockey club which organised demonstrations in the theatre to protest at the presentation of the ballet feature in act  instead of its traditional location in the second act but the opportunity was also exploited by those who wanted to use the occasion as a veiled political protest against the proaustrian policies of napoleon iii it was during this visit that wagner met the french poet charles baudelaire who wrote an appreciative brochure richard wagner et tannhäuser à paris the opera was withdrawn after the third performance and wagner left paris soon after he had sought a reconciliation with minna during this paris visit and although she joined him there the reunion was not successful and they again parted from each other when wagner left return and resurgence –edit the political ban that had been placed on wagner in germany after he had fled dresden was fully lifted in  the composer settled in biebrich on the rhine near wiesbaden in hesse here minna visited him for the last time they parted irrevocably though wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in dresden until her death in  portrait of ludwig ii of bavaria about the time when he first met wagner by ferdinand von piloty  in biebrich wagner at last began work on die meistersinger von nürnberg his only mature comedy wagner wrote a first draft of the libretto in  and he had resolved to develop it during a visit he had made to venice with the wesendoncks in  where he was inspired by titians painting the assumption of the virgin throughout this period – wagner sought to have tristan und isolde produced in vienna despite numerous rehearsals the opera remained unperformed and gained a reputation as being impossible to sing which added to wagners financial problems wagners fortunes took a dramatic upturn in  when king ludwig ii succeeded to the throne of bavaria at the age of  the young king an ardent admirer of wagners operas had the composer brought to munich the king who was homosexual expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composern  and wagner in his responses had no scruples about counterfeiting a similar atmospheren  ludwig settled wagners considerable debts and proposed to stage tristan die meistersinger the ring and the other operas wagner planned wagner also began to dictate his autobiography mein leben at the kings request wagner noted that his rescue by ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor but later supposed enemy giacomo meyerbeer and regretted that this operatic master who had done me so much harm should not have lived to see this day after grave difficulties in rehearsal tristan und isolde premiered at the national theatre munich on  june  the first wagner opera premiere in almost  years the premiere had been scheduled for  may but was delayed by bailiffs acting for wagners creditors and also because the isolde malvina schnorr von carolsfeld was hoarse and needed time to recover the conductor of this premiere was hans von bülow whose wife cosima had given birth in april that year to a daughter named isolde a child not of bülow but of wagner cosima was  years younger than wagner and was herself illegitimate the daughter of the countess marie dagoult who had left her husband for franz liszt liszt initially disapproved of his daughters involvement with wagner though nevertheless the two men were friends the indiscreet affair scandalised munich and wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court who were suspicious of his influence on the king in december  ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave munich he apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile but wagner quickly dissuaded him richard and cosima wagner photographed in  ludwig installed wagner at the villa tribschen beside switzerlands lake lucerne die meistersinger was completed at tribschen in  and premiered in munich on  june the following year at ludwigs insistence special previews of the first two works of the ring das rheingold and die walküre were performed at munich in  and  but wagner retained his dream first expressed in a communication to my friends to present the first complete cycle at a special festival with a new dedicated opera house minna had died of a heart attack on  january  in dresden wagner did not attend the funeraln  following minnas death cosima wrote to hans von bülow on a number of occasions asking him to grant her a divorce but bülow refused to concede this he only consented after she had two more children with wagner another daughter named eva after the heroine of meistersinger and a son siegfried named for the hero of the ring the divorce was finally sanctioned after delays in the legal process by a berlin court on  july  richard and cosimas wedding took place on  august  on christmas day of that year wagner arranged a surprise performance its premiere of the siegfried idyll for cosimas birthdayn  the marriage to cosima lasted to the end of wagners life wagner settled into his newfound domesticity turned his energies towards completing the ring cycle he had not abandoned polemics he republished his  pamphlet judaism in music originally issued under a pseudonym under his own name in  he extended the introduction and wrote a lengthy additional final section the publication led to several public protests at early performances of die meistersinger in vienna and mannheim bayreuth –edit in  wagner decided to move to bayreuth which was to be the location of his new opera house the town council donated a large plot of land—the green hill—as a site for the theatre the wagners moved to the town the following year and the foundation stone for the bayreuth festspielhaus festival theatre was laid wagner initially announced the first bayreuth festival at which for the first time the ring cycle would be presented complete for  but since ludwig had declined to finance the project the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the festival was deferred to raise funds for the construction wagner societies were formed in several cities and wagner began touring germany conducting concerts by the spring of  only a third of the required funds had been raised further pleas to ludwig were initially ignored but early in  with the project on the verge of collapse the king relented and provided a loan the full building programme included the family home wahnfried into which wagner with cosima and the children moved from their temporary accommodation on  april  the theatre was completed in  and the festival scheduled for the following year commenting on the struggle to finish the building wagner remarked to cosima each stone is red with my blood and yours the bayreuth festspielhaus photochrom print of c  for the design of the festspielhaus wagner appropriated some of the ideas of his former colleague gottfried semper which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at munich wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at bayreuth these include darkening the auditorium during performances and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience the festspielhaus finally opened on  august  with das rheingold at last taking its place as the first evening of the complete ring cycle the  bayreuth festival therefore saw the premiere of the complete cycle performed as a sequence as the composer had intended the  festival consisted of three full ring cycles under the baton of hans richter at the end critical reactions ranged between that of the norwegian composer edvard grieg who thought the work divinely composed and that of the french newspaper le figaro which called the music the dream of a lunatic amongst the disillusioned were wagners friend and disciple friedrich nietzsche who having published his eulogistic essay richard wagner in bayreuth before the festival as part of his untimely meditations was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as wagners pandering to increasingly exclusivist german nationalism his breach with wagner began at this time the festival firmly established wagner as an artist of european and indeed world importance attendees included kaiser wilhelm i the emperor pedro ii of brazil anton bruckner camille saintsaëns and pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky wagner was far from satisfied with the festival cosima recorded that months later his attitude towards the productions was never again never again moreover the festival finished with a deficit of about  marks the expenses of bayreuth and of wahnfried meant that wagner still sought additional sources of income by conducting or taking on commissions such as the centennial march for america for which he received  last years –edit following the first bayreuth festival wagner began work on parsifal his final opera the composition took four years much of which wagner spent in italy for health reasons from  to  wagner also embarked on the last of his documented emotional liaisons this time with judith gautier whom he had met at the  festival wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing parsifal and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than bayreuth he was once again assisted by the liberality of king ludwig but was still forced by his personal financial situation in  to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works including the siegfried idyll to the publisher schott the wagner grave in the wahnfried garden in  cosimas ashes were placed alongside wagners body wagner wrote a number of articles in his later years often on political topics and often reactionary in tone repudiating some of his earlier more liberal views these include religion and art  and heroism and christianity  which were printed in the journal bayreuther blätter published by his supporter hans von wolzogen wagners sudden interest in christianity at this period which infuses parsifal was contemporary with his increasing alignment with german nationalism and required on his part and the part of his associates the rewriting of some recent wagnerian history so as to represent for example the ring as a work reflecting christian ideals many of these later articles including what is german  but based on a draft written in the s repeated wagners antisemitic preoccupations wagner completed parsifal in january  and a second bayreuth festival was held for the new opera which premiered on  may wagner was by this time extremely ill having suffered a series of increasingly severe angina attacks during the sixteenth and final performance of parsifal on  august he entered the pit unseen during act  took the baton from conductor hermann levi and led the performance to its conclusion after the festival the wagner family journeyed to venice for the winter wagner died of a heart attack at the age of  on  february  at ca vendramin calergi a thcentury palazzo on the grand canal the legend that the attack was prompted by argument with cosima over wagners supposedly amorous interest in the singer carrie pringle who had been a flowermaiden in parsifal at bayreuth is without credible evidence after a funerary gondola bore wagners remains over the grand canal his body was taken to germany where it was buried in the

primary artistic legacy unlike most opera composers who generally left the task of writing the libretto the text and lyrics to others wagner wrote his own libretti which he referred to as poems from  onwards he urged a new concept of opera often referred to as music drama although he later rejected this termn  in which all musical poetic and dramatic elements were to be fused together—the

leitmotifs musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters locales and plot elements their complex interweaving and evolution illuminates the progression of the drama these operas are still despite wagners reservations referred to by many writers as music dramas early works to edit wagners earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on goethes die laune des verliebten the infatuated lovers caprice written at the age of  die hochzeit the wedding on which wagner worked in  and the singspiel männerlist größer als frauenlist men are more cunning than women – die feen the fairies  was unperformed in the composers lifetime and das liebesverbot the ban on love  was withdrawn after its first performance rienzi  was wagners first opera to be successfully staged the compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated rienzi showing the clear influence of grand opera à la spontini and meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark wagners place in musical history later in life wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his oeuvre none of them has ever been performed at the bayreuth festival and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years although the overture to rienzi is an occasional concert piece die feen das liebesverbot and rienzi were performed at both leipzig and bayreuth in  to mark the composers bicentenary romantic operas –edit opening of overture to der fliegende holländer in wagners hand and with his notes to the publisher wagners middle stage output began with der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman  followed by tannhäuser  and lohengrin  these three operas are sometimes referred to as wagners romantic operas they reinforced the reputation among the public in germany and beyond that wagner had begun to establish with rienzi although distancing himself from the style of these operas from  onwards he nevertheless reworked both der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser on several occasionsn  these three operas are considered to represent a significant developmental stage in wagners musical and operatic maturity as regards thematic handling portrayal of emotions and orchestration they are the earliest works included in the bayreuth canon the mature operas that cosima staged at the bayreuth festival after wagners death in accordance with his wishes all three including the differing versions of der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser continue to be regularly performed throughout the world and have been frequently recordedn  they were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetimen  music dramas –edit starting the ringedit main articles der ring des nibelungen der ring des nibelungen composition of the music and der ring des nibelungen composition of the poem brünnhilde the valkyrie as illustrated by arthur rackham  wagners late dramas are considered his masterpieces der ring des nibelungen commonly referred to as the ring or ring cycle is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of germanic mythology—particularly from the later norse mythology—notably the old norse poetic edda and volsunga saga and the middle high german nibelungenlied wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of stabreim highly alliterative rhyming versepairs used in old germanic poetry they were also influenced by wagners concepts of ancient greek drama in which tetralogies were a component of athenian festivals and which he had amply discussed in his essay oper und drama the first two components of the ring cycle were das rheingold the rhinegold which was completed in  and die walküre the valkyrie which was finished in  in das rheingold with its relentlessly talky realism and the absence of lyrical numbers wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his – essays die walküre which contains what is virtually a traditional aria siegmunds winterstürme in the first act and the quasichoral appearance of the valkyries themselves shows more operatic traits but has been assessed by barry millington as the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of oper und drama a thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression tristan und isolde and die meistersingeredit while composing the opera siegfried the third part of the ring cycle wagner interrupted work on it and between  and  wrote the tragic love story tristan und isolde and his only mature comedy die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon franz betz who created the role of hans sachs in die meistersinger and sang wotan in the first complete ring cycle tristan is often granted a special place in musical history many see it as the beginning of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the th century wagner felt that his musicodramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of the art of transition between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines completed in  the work was given its first performance in munich conducted by bülow in june  die meistersinger was originally conceived by wagner in  as a sort of comic pendant to tannhäuser like tristan it was premiered in munich under the baton of bülow on  june  and became an immediate success barry millington describes meistersinger as a rich perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity but because of its strong german nationalist overtones it is also cited by some as an example of wagners reactionary politics and antisemitism completing the ringedit when wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of siegfried and for götterdämmerung twilight of the gods as the final part of the ring his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as operatic than the aural world of rheingold and walküre though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs this was in part because the libretti of the four ring operas had been written in reverse order so that the book for götterdämmerung was conceived more traditionally than that of rheingold still the selfimposed strictures of the gesamtkunstwerk had become relaxed the differences also result from wagners development as a composer during the period in which he wrote tristan meistersinger and the paris version of tannhäuser from act  of siegfried onwards the ring becomes more chromatic melodically more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs wagner took  years from writing the first draft of a libretto in  until he completed götterdämmerung in  the ring takes about  hours to perform and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the worlds stages parsifaledit wagners final opera parsifal  which was his only work written especially for his bayreuth festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a bühnenweihfestspiel festival play for the consecration of the stage has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the holy grail it also carries elements of buddhist renunciation suggested by wagners readings of schopenhauer wagner described it to cosima as his last card it remains controversial because of its treatment of christianity its eroticism and its expression as perceived by some commentators of german nationalism and antisemitism despite the composers own description of the opera to king ludwig as this most christian of works ulrike kienzle has commented that wagners turn to christian mythology upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of parsifal rest is idiosyncratic and contradicts christian dogma in many ways musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composers style and barry millington describes it as a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement nonoperatic musicedit andré gill suggesting that wagners music was earsplitting cover of léclipse  april  apart from his operas wagner composed relatively few pieces of music these include a symphony in c major written at the age of  the faust overture the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject some overtures and choral and piano pieces his most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the siegfried idyll for chamber orchestra which has several motifs in common with the ring cycle the wesendonck lieder are also often performed either in the original piano version or with orchestral accompanimentn  more rarely performed are the american centennial march  and das liebesmahl der apostel the love feast of the apostles a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in  for the city of dresden after completing parsifal wagner expressed his intention to turn to the writing of symphonies and several sketches dating from the late s and early s have been identified as work towards this end the overtures and certain orchestral passages from wagners middle and latestage operas are commonly played as concert pieces for most of these wagner wrote or rewrote short passages to ensure musical coherence the bridal chorus from lohengrin is frequently played as the brides processional wedding march in englishspeaking countries prose writingsedit see also categoryessays by richard wagner and categoryautobiographical works by richard wagner wagner was an extremely prolific writer authoring numerous books poems and articles as well as voluminous correspondence his writings covered a wide range of topics including autobiography politics philosophy and detailed analyses of his own operas wagner planned for a collected edition of his publications as early as  he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims the first such edition was published between  and  but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him eg those praising meyerbeer or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce wagners own account of his progress wagners autobiography mein leben was originally published for close friends only in a very small edition – copies per volume in four volumes between  and  the first public edition with many passages suppressed by cosima appeared in  the first attempt at a full edition in german appeared in  there have been modern complete or partial editions of wagners writings including a centennial edition in german edited by dieter borchmeyer which however omitted the essay das judenthum in der musik and mein leben the english translations of wagners prose in eight volumes by w ashton ellis – are still in print and commonly used despite their deficiencies a complete edition of wagners correspondence estimated to amount to

harmony melodic process leitmotif and operatic structure notably from tristan und isolde onwards he explored the limits of the traditional tonal system which gave keys and chords their identity pointing the way to atonality in the th century some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of tristan which include the socalled tristan chord gustav mahler wagner inspired great devotion for a long period many composers were inclined to align themselves with or against wagners music anton bruckner and hugo wolf were greatly indebted to him as were césar franck henri duparc ernest chausson jules massenet richard strauss alexander von zemlinsky hans pfitzner and numerous others gustav mahler was devoted to wagner and his music aged  he sought him out on his  visit to vienna became a renowned wagner conductor and his compositions are seen by richard taruskin as extending wagners maximalization of the temporal and the sonorous in music to the world of the symphony the harmonic revolutions of claude debussy and arnold schoenberg both of whose oeuvres contain examples of tonal and atonal modernism have often been traced back to tristan and parsifal the italian form of operatic realism known as verismo owed much to the wagnerian concept of musical form wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting his essay about conducting  advanced hector berliozs technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be reinterpreted rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison he exemplified this approach in his own conducting which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of felix mendelssohn in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon such as the rewriting of scoresn  wilhelm furtwängler felt that wagner and bülow through their interpretative approach inspired a whole new generation of conductors including furtwängler himself amongst those claiming inspiration from wagners music are the german band rammstein and the electronic composer klaus schulze whose  album timewind consists of two minute tracks bayreuth return and wahnfried  joey demaio of the band manowar has described wagner as the father of heavy metal the slovenian group laibach created the  suite volkswagner using material from wagners operas phil spectors wall of sound recording technique was it has been claimed heavily influenced by wagner influence on literature philosophy and the visual artsedit friedrich nietzsche wagners influence on literature and philosophy is significant millington has commented wagners protean abundance meant that he could inspire the use of literary motif in many a novel employing interior monologue  the symbolists saw him as a mystic hierophant the decadents found many a frisson in his work friedrich nietzsche was a member of wagners inner circle during the early s and his first published work the birth of tragedy proposed wagners music as the dionysian rebirth of european culture in opposition to apollonian rationalist decadence nietzsche broke with wagner following the first bayreuth festival believing that wagners final phase represented a pandering to christian pieties and a surrender to the new german reich nietzsche expressed his displeasure with the later wagner in the case of wagner and nietzsche contra wagner charles baudelaire stéphane mallarmé and paul verlaine worshipped wagner édouard dujardin whose influential novel les lauriers sont coupés is in the form of an interior monologue inspired by wagnerian music founded a journal dedicated to wagner la revue wagnérienne to which j k huysmans and téodor de wyzewa contributed in a list of major cultural figures influenced by wagner bryan magee includes d h lawrence aubrey beardsley romain rolland gérard de nerval pierreauguste renoir rainer maria rilke and numerous others unveiling of the richard wagner monument in the tiergarten  by anton von werner in the th century w h auden once called wagner perhaps the greatest genius that ever lived while thomas mann and marcel proust were heavily influenced by him and discussed wagner in their novels he is also discussed in some of the works of james joyce wagnerian themes inhabit t s eliots the waste land which contains lines from tristan und isolde and götterdämmerung and verlaines poem on parsifal many of wagners concepts including his speculation about dreams predated their investigation by sigmund freud wagner had publicly analysed the oedipus myth before freud was born in terms of its psychological significance insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety georg groddeck considered the ring as the first manual of psychoanalysis influence on cinemaedit wagners concept of the use of leitmotifs and the integrated musical expression which they can enable has influenced many th and st century film scores the critic theodor adorno has noted that the wagnerian leitmotif leads directly to cinema music where the sole function of the leitmotif is to announce heroes or situations so as to allow the audience to orient itself more easily amongst film scores citing wagnerian themes are francis ford coppolas apocalypse now which features a version of the ride of the valkyries trevor joness soundtrack to john boormans film excalibur and the  films a dangerous method dir david cronenberg and melancholia dir lars von trier hansjürgen syberbergs  film hitler a film from germanys visual style and set design are strongly inspired by der ring des nibelungen musical excerpts from which are frequently used in the films soundtrack opponents and supportersedit eduard hanslick not all reaction to wagner was positive for a time german musical life divided into two factions supporters of wagner and supporters of johannes brahms the latter with the support of the powerful critic eduard hanslick of whom beckmesser in meistersinger is in part a caricature championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against wagnerian innovations they were supported by the conservative leanings of some german music schools including the conservatories at leipzig under ignaz moscheles and at cologne under the direction of ferdinand hiller another wagner detractor was the french composer charlesvalentin alkan who wrote to hiller after attending wagners paris concert on  january  at which wagner conducted the overtures to der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser the preludes to lohengrin and tristan und isolde and six other extracts from tannhäuser and lohengrin i had imagined that i was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of berlioz  i do not like all the music of berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects  but here he was imitated and caricatured  wagner is not a musician he is a disease even those who like debussy opposed wagner this old poisoner could not deny his influence indeed debussy was one of many composers including tchaikovsky who felt the need to break with wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming golliwoggs cakewalk from debussys childrens corner piano suite contains a deliberately tongueincheek quotation from the opening bars of tristan others who proved resistant to wagners operas included gioachino rossini who said wagner has wonderful moments and dreadful quarters of an hour in the th century wagners music was parodied by paul hindemithn  and hanns eisler among others wagners followers known as wagnerians or wagnerites have formed many societies dedicated to wagners life and work film and stage portrayalsedit main article list of films about richard wagner wagner has been the subject of many biographical films the earliest was a silent film made by carl froelich in  and featured in the title role the composer giuseppe becce who also wrote the score for the film as wagners music still in copyright was not

sons wieland and wolfgang wagner and presently two of the composers greatgranddaughters eva wagnerpasquier and katharina wagner since  the festival has been overseen by the richardwagnerstiftung richard wagner foundation the members of which include a number of wagners descendants controversiesedit main article wagner controversies wagners operas writings politics beliefs and unorthodox lifestyle made him a controversial figure during his lifetime following his death debate about his ideas and their interpretation particularly in germany during the th century has continued racism and antisemitismedit caricature of wagner by karl clic in the viennese satirical magazine humoristische blätter  the exaggerated features refer to rumours of wagners jewish ancestry wagners writings on jews including jewishness in music corresponded to some existing trends of thought in germany during the th century however despite his very public views on these themes throughout his life wagner had jewish friends colleagues and supporters there have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in wagners operas the characters of mime in the ring sixtus beckmesser in die meistersinger and klingsor in parsifal are sometimes claimed as jewish representations though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operasn  the topic of wagner and the jews is further complicated by allegations which may have been credited by wagner that he himself was of jewish ancestry via his supposed father geyer some biographers have noted that wagner in his final years developed interest in the racialist philosophy of arthur de gobineau notably gobineaus belief that western society was doomed because of miscegenation between superior and inferior races according to robert gutman this theme is reflected in the opera parsifal other biographers such as lucy beckett believe that this is not true as the original drafts of the story date back to  and wagner had completed the libretto for parsifal by  but he displayed no significant interest in gobineau until  other interpretationsedit wagners ideas are amenable to socialist interpretations many of his ideas on art were being formulated at the time of his revolutionary inclinations in the s thus for example george bernard shaw wrote in the perfect wagnerite  wagners picture of niblunghomen  under the reign of alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it was made known in germany in the middle of the th century by engelss book the condition of the working class in england leftwing interpretations of wagner also inform the writings of theodor adorno among other wagner criticsn  walter benjamin gave wagner as an example of bourgeois false consciousness alienating art from its social context the writer robert donington has produced a detailed if controversial jungian interpretation of the ring cycle described as an approach to wagner by way of his symbols which for example sees the character of the goddess fricka as part of her husband wotans inner femininity millington notes that jeanjacques nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of wagners life and works nazi appropriationedit adolf hitler was an admirer of wagners music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the german nation in a  speech he claimed that wagners works glorified the heroic teutonic nature  greatness lies in the heroic hitler visited bayreuth frequently from  onwards and attended the productions at the theatre there continues to be debate about the extent to which wagners views might have influenced nazi thinkingn  houston stewart chamberlain – who married wagners daughter eva in  but never met wagner was the author of the racist book the foundations of the nineteenth century approved by the nazi movement chamberlain met hitler on a number of occasions between  and  in bayreuth but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of wagners own views the nazis used those parts of wagners thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest while bayreuth presented a useful front for nazi culture and wagners music was used at many nazi events the nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share hitlers enthusiasm for wagners operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at hitlers insistence guido fackler has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that wagners music was used at the dachau concentration camp in – to reeducate political prisoners by exposure to national music there has been no evidence to support claims sometimes made that his music was played at nazi death camps during the second world war and pamela potter has noted that wagners music was explicitly offlimits in the campsn  because of the associations of wagner with antisemitism and nazism the performance of his music in the state of israel has been a source of controversy see alsoedit richard wagner – wikipedia book notesedit  of their children two carl gustave and maria theresia died as infants the others were wagners brothers albert and carl julius and his sisters rosalie luise clara and ottilie except for carl julius becoming a goldsmith all his siblings developed careers connected with the stage wagner also had a younger halfsister caecilie born in  to his mother and her second husband geyer see also wagner family tree  this sketch is referred to alternatively as leubald und adelaide  wagner claimed to have seen schröderdevrient in the title role of fidelio but it seems more likely that he saw her performance as romeo in bellinis i capuleti e i montecchi  röckel and bakunin failed to escape and endured long terms of imprisonment  gutman records him as suffering from constipation and shingles  the influence was noted by nietzsche in his on the genealogy of morality the fascinating position of schopenhauer on art  was apparently the reason richard wagner first moved over to schopenhauer  that shift was so great that it opened up a complete theoretical contrast between his earlier and his later aesthetic beliefs  for example the selfrenouncing cobblerpoet hans sachs in die meistersinger von nürnberg is a schopenhauerian creation schopenhauer asserted that goodness and salvation result from renunciation of the world and turning against and denying ones own will  eg my dearest beloved my beloved my most glorious friend and o holy one i worship you  wagner excused himself in  when discussing this correspondence with cosima by saying the tone wasnt good but i didnt set it  wagner claimed to be unable to travel to the funeral due to an inflamed finger  cosimas birthday was  december but she usually celebrated it on christmas day  in his  essay on

wagner ˈvɑːɡnər german ˈʁiçaʁt ˈvaːɡnɐ  may  –  february  was a german composer theatre director polemicist and conductor who is primarily known for his operas or as some of his later works were later known music dramas unlike most opera composers wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of weber and meyerbeer wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the gesamtkunstwerk total work of art by which he sought to synthesise the poetic visual musical and dramatic arts with music subsidiary to drama he described this vision in a series of essays published between  and  wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen the ring of the nibelung his compositions particularly those of his later period are notable for their complex textures rich harmonies and orchestration and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters places ideas or plot elements his advances in musical language such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres greatly influenced the development of classical music his tristan und isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music wagner had his own opera house built the bayreuth festspielhaus which embodied many novel design features the ring and parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual bayreuth festival run by his descendants his thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works including die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg until his final years wagners life was characterised by political exile turbulent love affairs poverty and repeated flight from his creditors his controversial writings on music drama and politics have attracted extensive comment notably since the late th century where they express antisemitic sentiments the effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts

family in leipzig where his family lived at no  the brühl the house of the red and white lions in the jewish quarter he was baptized at st thomas church he was the ninth child of carl friedrich wagner who was a clerk in the leipzig police service and his wife johanna rosine née paetz the daughter of a bakern  wagners father carl died of typhus six months after richards birth afterwards his mother johanna lived with carls friend the actor and playwright ludwig geyer in august  johanna and geyer probably married—although no documentation of this has been found in the leipzig church registers she and her family moved to geyers residence in dresden until he was fourteen wagner was known as wilhelm richard geyer he almost certainly thought that geyer was his biological father geyers love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson and wagner took part in his performances in his autobiography mein leben wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel in late  wagner was enrolled at pastor wetzels school at possendorf near dresden where he received some piano instruction from his latin teacher he struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear following geyers death in  richard was sent to the kreuzschule the boarding school of the dresdner kreuzchor at the expense of geyers brother at the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the gothic elements of carl maria von webers opera der freischütz which he saw weber conduct at this period wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright his first creative effort listed in the wagnerwerkverzeichnis the standard listing of wagners works as wwv  was a tragedy called leubald begun when he was in school in  the play was strongly influenced by shakespeare and goethe wagner was determined to set it to music and persuaded his family to allow him music lessonsn  by  the family had returned to leipzig wagners first lessons in harmony were taken during – with christian gottlieb müller in january  he first heard beethovens th symphony and then in march the same composers th symphony both at the gewandhaus beethoven became a major inspiration and wagner wrote a piano transcription of the th symphony he was also greatly impressed by a performance of mozarts requiem wagners early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period in  he saw a performance by dramatic soprano wilhelmine schröderdevrient and she became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera in mein leben wagner wrote when i look back across my entire life i find no event to place beside this in the impression it produced on me and claimed that the profoundly human and ecstatic performance of this incomparable artist kindled in him an almost demonic firen  in  wagner enrolled at the leipzig university where he became a member of the saxon student fraternity he took composition lessons with the thomaskantor theodor weinlig weinlig was so impressed with wagners musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons he arranged for his pupils piano sonata in bflat major which was consequently dedicated to him to be published as wagners op  a year later wagner composed his symphony in c major a beethovenesque work performed in prague in  and at the leipzig gewandhaus in  he then began to work on an opera die hochzeit the wedding which he never completed early career and marriage –edit wilhelmine minna planer  by alexander von otterstedt in  wagners brother albert managed to obtain for him a position as choir master at the theatre in würzburg in the same year at the age of  wagner composed his first complete opera die feen the fairies this work which imitated the style of weber went unproduced until half a century later when it was premiered in munich shortly after the composers death in  having returned to leipzig in  wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in magdeburg during which he wrote das liebesverbot the ban on love based on shakespeares measure for measure this was staged at magdeburg in  but closed before the second performance this together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him left the composer in bankruptcy wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at magdeburg the actress christine wilhelmine minna planer and after the disaster of das liebesverbot he followed her to königsberg where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre the two married in tragheim church on  november  in may  minna left wagner for another man and this was but only the first débâcle of a tempestuous marriage in june  wagner moved to riga then in the russian empire where he became music director of the local opera having in this capacity engaged minnas sister amalie also a singer for the theatre he presently resumed relations with minna during  by  the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled riga on the run from creditors debts would plague wagner for most of his life initially they took a stormy sea passage to london from which wagner drew the inspiration for his opera der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman with a plot based on a sketch by heinrich heine the wagners settled in paris in september  and stayed there until  wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as a pilgrimage to beethoven which sketched his growing concept of music drama and an end in paris where he depicts his own miseries as a german musician in the french metropolis he also provided arrangements of operas by other composers largely on behalf of the schlesinger publishing house during this stay he completed his third and fourth operas rienzi and der fliegende holländer dresden –edit wagner c  by ernest benedikt kietz wagner had completed rienzi in  with the strong support of giacomo meyerbeer it was accepted for performance by the dresden court theatre hofoper in the kingdom of saxony and in  wagner moved to dresden his relief at returning to germany was recorded in his autobiographic sketch of  where he wrote that en route from paris for the first time i saw the rhine—with hot tears in my eyes i poor artist swore eternal fidelity to my german fatherland rienzi was staged to considerable acclaim on  october wagner lived in dresden for the next six years eventually being appointed the royal saxon court conductor during this period he staged there der fliegende holländer  january  and tannhäuser  october  the first two of his three middleperiod operas wagner also mixed with artistic circles in dresden including the composer ferdinand hiller and the architect gottfried semper wagners involvement in leftwing politics abruptly ended his welcome in dresden wagner was active among socialist german nationalists there regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor august röckel and the russian anarchist mikhail bakunin he was also influenced by the ideas of pierrejoseph proudhon and ludwig feuerbach widespread discontent came to a head in  when the unsuccessful may uprising in dresden broke out in which wagner played a minor supporting role warrants were issued for the revolutionaries arrest wagner had to flee first visiting paris and then settling in zürichn  where he at first took refuge with a friend alexander müller in exile switzerland –edit warrant for the arrest of richard wagner issued on  may  wagner was to spend the next twelve years in exile from germany he had completed lohengrin the last of his middleperiod operas before the dresden uprising and now wrote desperately to his friend franz liszt to have it staged in his absence liszt conducted the premiere in weimar in august  nevertheless wagner was in grim personal straits isolated from the german musical world and without any regular income in  julie the wife of his friend karl ritter began to pay him a small pension which she maintained until  with help from her friend jessie laussot this was to have been augmented to an annual sum of  thalers per year but this plan was abandoned when wagner began an affair with mme laussot wagner even planned an elopement with her in  which her husband prevented meanwhile wagners wife minna who had disliked the operas he had written after rienzi was falling into a deepening depression wagner fell victim to illhealth according to ernest newman largely a matter of overwrought nerves which made it difficult for him to continue writingn  wagners primary published output during his first years in zürich was a set of essays in the artwork of the future  he described a vision of opera as gesamtkunstwerk total work of art in which the various arts such as music song dance poetry visual arts and stagecraft were unified judaism in music  was the first of wagners writings to feature antisemitic views in this polemic wagner argued frequently using traditional antisemitic abuse that jews had no connection to the german spirit and were thus capable of producing only shallow and artificial music according to him they composed music to achieve popularity and thereby financial success as opposed to creating genuine works of art in opera and drama  wagner described the aesthetics of drama that he was using to create the ring operas before leaving dresden wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen he initially wrote the libretto for a single opera siegfrieds tod siegfrieds death in  after arriving in zürich he expanded the story with the opera der junge siegfried young siegfried which explored the heros background he completed the text of the cycle by writing the libretti for die walküre the valkyrie and das rheingold the rhine gold and revising the other libretti to agree with his new concept completing them in  the concept of opera expressed in opera and drama and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written up to and including lohengrin partly in an attempt to explain his change of views wagner published in  the autobiographical a communication to my friends this contained his first public announcement of what was to become the ring cycle i shall never write an opera more as i have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works i will call them dramas  i propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas preceded by a lengthy prelude vorspiel  at a speciallyappointed festival i propose some future time to produce those three dramas with their prelude in the course of three days and a foreevening emphasis in original wagner began composing the music for das rheingold between november  and september  following it immediately with die walküre written between june  and march  he began work on the third ring opera which he now called simply siegfried probably in september  but by june  he had completed only the first two acts he decided to put the work aside to concentrate on a new idea tristan und isolde based on the arthurian love story tristan and iseult portrait of mathilde wesendonck  by karl ferdinand sohn one source of inspiration for tristan und isolde was the philosophy of arthur schopenhauer notably his the world as will and representation to which wagner had been introduced in  by his poet friend georg herwegh wagner later called this the most important event of his life his personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be schopenhauers philosophy a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition he remained an adherent of schopenhauer for the rest of his life one of schopenhauers doctrines was that music held a supreme role in the arts as a direct expression of the worlds essence namely blind impulsive will this doctrine contradicted wagners view expressed in opera and drama that the music in opera had to be subservient to the drama wagner scholars have argued that schopenhauers influence caused wagner to assign a more commanding role to music in his later operas including the latter half of the ring cycle which he had yet to

of the silk merchant otto wesendonck wagner met the wesendoncks who were both great admirers of his music in zürich in  from may  onwards wesendonck made several loans to wagner to finance his household expenses in zürich and in  placed a cottage on his estate at wagners disposal which became known as the asyl asylum or place of rest during this period wagners growing passion for his patrons wife inspired him to put aside work on the ring cycle which was not resumed for the next twelve years and begin work on tristan while planning the opera wagner composed the wesendonck lieder five songs for voice and piano setting poems by mathilde two of these settings are explicitly subtitled by wagner as studies for tristan und isolde amongst the conducting engagements that wagner undertook for revenue during this period he gave several concerts in  with the london philharmonic society including one before queen victoria the queen enjoyed his tannhäuser overture and spoke with wagner after the concert writing of him in her diary that he was short very quiet wears spectacles  has a very finelydeveloped forehead a hooked nose  projecting chin in exile venice and paris –edit wagner in paris  wagners uneasy affair with mathilde collapsed in  when minna intercepted a letter to mathilde from him after the resulting confrontation with minna wagner left zürich alone bound for venice where he rented an apartment in the palazzo giustinian while minna returned to germany wagners attitude to minna had changed the editor of his correspondence with her john burk has said that she was to him an invalid to be treated with kindness and consideration but except at a distance was a menace to his peace of mind wagner continued his correspondence with mathilde and his friendship with her husband otto who maintained his financial support of the composer in an  letter to mathilde wagner wrote halfsatirically of tristan child this tristan is turning into something terrible this final act—i fear the opera will be banned  only mediocre performances can save me perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad in november  wagner once again moved to paris to oversee production of a new revision of tannhäuser staged thanks to the efforts of princess pauline von metternich whose husband was the austrian ambassador in paris the performances of the paris tannhäuser in  were a notable fiasco this was partly a consequence of the conservative tastes of the jockey club which organised demonstrations in the theatre to protest at the presentation of the ballet feature in act  instead of its traditional location in the second act but the opportunity was also exploited by those who wanted to use the occasion as a veiled political protest against the proaustrian policies of napoleon iii it was during this visit that wagner met the french poet charles baudelaire who wrote an appreciative brochure richard wagner et tannhäuser à paris the opera was withdrawn after the third performance and wagner left paris soon after he had sought a reconciliation with minna during this paris visit and although she joined him there the reunion was not successful and they again parted from each other when wagner left return and resurgence –edit the political ban that had been placed on wagner in germany after he had fled dresden was fully lifted in  the composer settled in biebrich on the rhine near wiesbaden in hesse here minna visited him for the last time they parted irrevocably though wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in dresden until her death in  portrait of ludwig ii of bavaria about the time when he first met wagner by ferdinand von piloty  in biebrich wagner at last began work on die meistersinger von nürnberg his only mature comedy wagner wrote a first draft of the libretto in  and he had resolved to develop it during a visit he had made to venice with the wesendoncks in  where he was inspired by titians painting the assumption of the virgin throughout this period – wagner sought to have tristan und isolde produced in vienna despite numerous rehearsals the opera remained unperformed and gained a reputation as being impossible to sing which added to wagners financial problems wagners fortunes took a dramatic upturn in  when king ludwig ii succeeded to the throne of bavaria at the age of  the young king an ardent admirer of wagners operas had the composer brought to munich the king who was homosexual expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composern  and wagner in his responses had no scruples about counterfeiting a similar atmospheren  ludwig settled wagners considerable debts and proposed to stage tristan die meistersinger the ring and the other operas wagner planned wagner also began to dictate his autobiography mein leben at the kings request wagner noted that his rescue by ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor but later supposed enemy giacomo meyerbeer and regretted that this operatic master who had done me so much harm should not have lived to see this day after grave difficulties in rehearsal tristan und isolde premiered at the national theatre munich on  june  the first wagner opera premiere in almost  years the premiere had been scheduled for  may but was delayed by bailiffs acting for wagners creditors and also because the isolde malvina schnorr von carolsfeld was hoarse and needed time to recover the conductor of this premiere was hans von bülow whose wife cosima had given birth in april that year to a daughter named isolde a child not of bülow but of wagner cosima was  years younger than wagner and was herself illegitimate the daughter of the countess marie dagoult who had left her husband for franz liszt liszt initially disapproved of his daughters involvement with wagner though nevertheless the two men were friends the indiscreet affair scandalised munich and wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court who were suspicious of his influence on the king in december  ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave munich he apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile but wagner quickly dissuaded him richard and cosima wagner photographed in  ludwig installed wagner at the villa tribschen beside switzerlands lake lucerne die meistersinger was completed at tribschen in  and premiered in munich on  june the following year at ludwigs insistence special previews of the first two works of the ring das rheingold and die walküre were performed at munich in  and  but wagner retained his dream first expressed in a communication to my friends to present the first complete cycle at a special festival with a new dedicated opera house minna had died of a heart attack on  january  in dresden wagner did not attend the funeraln  following minnas death cosima wrote to hans von bülow on a number of occasions asking him to grant her a divorce but bülow refused to concede this he only consented after she had two more children with wagner another daughter named eva after the heroine of meistersinger and a son siegfried named for the hero of the ring the divorce was finally sanctioned after delays in the legal process by a berlin court on  july  richard and cosimas wedding took place on  august  on christmas day of that year wagner arranged a surprise performance its premiere of the siegfried idyll for cosimas birthdayn  the marriage to cosima lasted to the end of wagners life wagner settled into his newfound domesticity turned his energies towards completing the ring cycle he had not abandoned polemics he republished his  pamphlet judaism in music originally issued under a pseudonym under his own name in  he extended the introduction and wrote a lengthy additional final section the publication led to several public protests at early performances of die meistersinger in vienna and mannheim bayreuth –edit in  wagner decided to move to bayreuth which was to be the location of his new opera house the town council donated a large plot of land—the green hill—as a site for the theatre the wagners moved to the town the following year and the foundation stone for the bayreuth festspielhaus festival theatre was laid wagner initially announced the first bayreuth festival at which for the first time the ring cycle would be presented complete for  but since ludwig had declined to finance the project the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the festival was deferred to raise funds for the construction wagner societies were formed in several cities and wagner began touring germany conducting concerts by the spring of  only a third of the required funds had been raised further pleas to ludwig were initially ignored but early in  with the project on the verge of collapse the king relented and provided a loan the full building programme included the family home wahnfried into which wagner with cosima and the children moved from their temporary accommodation on  april  the theatre was completed in  and the festival scheduled for the following year commenting on the struggle to finish the building wagner remarked to cosima each stone is red with my blood and yours the bayreuth festspielhaus photochrom print of c  for the design of the festspielhaus wagner appropriated some of the ideas of his former colleague gottfried semper which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at munich wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at bayreuth these include darkening the auditorium during performances and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience the festspielhaus finally opened on  august  with das rheingold at last taking its place as the first evening of the complete ring cycle the  bayreuth festival therefore saw the premiere of the complete cycle performed as a sequence as the composer had intended the  festival consisted of three full ring cycles under the baton of hans richter at the end critical reactions ranged between that of the norwegian composer edvard grieg who thought the work divinely composed and that of the french newspaper le figaro which called the music the dream of a lunatic amongst the disillusioned were wagners friend and disciple friedrich nietzsche who having published his eulogistic essay richard wagner in bayreuth before the festival as part of his untimely meditations was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as wagners pandering to increasingly exclusivist german nationalism his breach with wagner began at this time the festival firmly established wagner as an artist of european and indeed world importance attendees included kaiser wilhelm i the emperor pedro ii of brazil anton bruckner camille saintsaëns and pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky wagner was far from satisfied with the festival cosima recorded that months later his attitude towards the productions was never again never again moreover the festival finished with a deficit of about  marks the expenses of bayreuth and of wahnfried meant that wagner still sought additional sources of income by conducting or taking on commissions such as the centennial march for america for which he received  last years –edit following the first bayreuth festival wagner began work on parsifal his final opera the composition took four years much of which wagner spent in italy for health reasons from  to  wagner also embarked on the last of his documented emotional liaisons this time with judith gautier whom he had met at the  festival wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing parsifal and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than bayreuth he was once again assisted by the liberality of king ludwig but was still forced by his personal financial situation in  to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works including the siegfried idyll to the publisher schott the wagner grave in the wahnfried garden in  cosimas ashes were placed alongside wagners body wagner wrote a number of articles in his later years often on political topics and often reactionary in tone repudiating some of his earlier more liberal views these include religion and art  and heroism and christianity  which were printed in the journal bayreuther blätter published by his supporter hans von wolzogen wagners sudden interest in christianity at this period which infuses parsifal was contemporary with his increasing alignment with german nationalism and required on his part and the part of his associates the rewriting of some recent wagnerian history so as to represent for example the ring as a work reflecting christian ideals many of these later articles including what is german  but based on a draft written in the s repeated wagners antisemitic preoccupations wagner completed parsifal in january  and a second bayreuth festival was held for the new opera which premiered on  may wagner was by this time extremely ill having suffered a series of increasingly severe angina attacks during the sixteenth and final performance of parsifal on  august he entered the pit unseen during act  took the baton from conductor hermann levi and led the performance to its conclusion after the festival the wagner family journeyed to venice for the winter wagner died of a heart attack at the age of  on  february  at ca vendramin calergi a thcentury palazzo on the grand canal the legend that the attack was prompted by argument with cosima over wagners supposedly amorous interest in the singer carrie pringle who had been a flowermaiden in parsifal at bayreuth is without credible evidence after a funerary gondola bore wagners remains

of the hero of wagners opera siegfried wagners operatic works are his primary artistic legacy unlike most opera composers who generally left the task of writing the libretto the text and lyrics to others wagner wrote his own libretti which he referred to as poems from  onwards he urged a new concept of opera often referred to as music drama although he later rejected this termn  in which all musical poetic and dramatic elements were to be fused together—the gesamtkunstwerk wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers the orchestras dramatic role in the later operas includes the use of leitmotifs musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters locales and plot elements their complex interweaving and evolution illuminates the progression of the drama these operas are still despite wagners reservations referred to by many writers as music dramas early works to edit wagners earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on goethes die laune des verliebten the infatuated lovers caprice written at the age of  die hochzeit the wedding on which wagner worked in  and the singspiel männerlist größer als frauenlist men are more cunning than women – die feen the fairies  was unperformed in the composers lifetime and das liebesverbot the ban on love  was withdrawn after its first performance rienzi  was wagners first opera to be successfully staged the compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated rienzi showing the clear influence of grand opera à la spontini and meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark wagners place in musical history later in life wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his oeuvre none of them has ever been performed at the bayreuth festival and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years although the overture to rienzi is an occasional concert piece die feen das liebesverbot and rienzi were performed at both leipzig and bayreuth in  to mark the composers bicentenary romantic operas –edit opening of overture to der fliegende holländer in wagners hand and with his notes to the publisher wagners middle stage output began with der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman  followed by tannhäuser  and lohengrin  these three operas are sometimes referred to as wagners romantic operas they reinforced the reputation among the public in germany and beyond that wagner had begun to establish with rienzi although distancing himself from the style of these operas from  onwards he nevertheless reworked both der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser on several occasionsn  these three operas are considered to represent a significant developmental stage in wagners musical and operatic maturity as regards thematic handling portrayal of emotions and orchestration they are the earliest works included in the bayreuth canon the mature operas that cosima staged at the bayreuth festival after wagners death in accordance with his wishes all three including the differing versions of der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser continue to be regularly performed throughout the world and have been frequently recordedn  they were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetimen  music dramas –edit starting the ringedit main articles der ring des nibelungen der ring des nibelungen composition of the music and der ring des nibelungen composition of the poem brünnhilde the valkyrie as illustrated by arthur rackham  wagners late dramas are considered his masterpieces der ring des nibelungen commonly referred to as the ring or ring cycle is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of germanic mythology—particularly from the later norse mythology—notably the old norse poetic edda and volsunga saga and the middle high german nibelungenlied wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of stabreim highly alliterative rhyming versepairs used in old germanic poetry they were also influenced by wagners concepts of ancient greek drama in which tetralogies were a component of athenian festivals and which he had amply discussed in his essay oper und drama the first two components of the ring cycle were das rheingold the rhinegold which was completed in  and die walküre the valkyrie which was finished in  in das rheingold with its relentlessly talky realism and the absence of lyrical numbers wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his – essays die walküre which contains what is virtually a traditional aria siegmunds winterstürme in the first act and the quasichoral appearance of the valkyries themselves shows more operatic traits but has been assessed by barry millington as the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of oper und drama a thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression tristan und isolde and die meistersingeredit while composing the opera siegfried the third part of the ring cycle wagner interrupted work on it and between  and  wrote the tragic love story tristan und isolde and his only mature comedy die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon franz betz who created the role of hans sachs in die meistersinger and sang wotan in the first complete ring cycle tristan is often granted a special place in musical history many see it as the beginning of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the th century wagner felt that his musicodramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of the art of transition between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines completed in  the work was given its first performance in munich conducted by bülow in june  die meistersinger was originally conceived by wagner in  as a sort of comic pendant to tannhäuser like tristan it was premiered in munich under the baton of bülow on  june  and became an immediate success barry millington describes meistersinger as a rich perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity but because of its strong german nationalist overtones it is also cited by some as an example of wagners reactionary politics and antisemitism completing the ringedit when wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of siegfried and for götterdämmerung twilight of the gods as the final part of the ring his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as operatic than the aural world of rheingold and walküre though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs this was in part because the libretti of the four ring operas had been written in reverse order so that the book for götterdämmerung was conceived more traditionally than that of rheingold still the selfimposed strictures of the gesamtkunstwerk had become relaxed the differences also result from wagners development as a composer during the period in which he wrote tristan meistersinger and the paris version of tannhäuser from act  of siegfried onwards the ring becomes more chromatic melodically more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs wagner took  years from writing the first draft of a libretto in  until he completed götterdämmerung in  the ring takes about  hours to perform and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the worlds stages parsifaledit wagners final opera parsifal  which was his only work written especially for his bayreuth festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a bühnenweihfestspiel festival play for the consecration of the stage has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the holy grail it also carries elements of buddhist renunciation suggested by wagners readings of schopenhauer wagner described it to cosima as his last card it remains controversial because of its treatment of christianity its eroticism and its expression as perceived by some commentators of german nationalism and antisemitism despite the composers own description of the opera to king ludwig as this most christian of works ulrike kienzle has commented that wagners turn to christian mythology upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of parsifal rest is idiosyncratic and contradicts christian dogma in many ways musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composers style and barry millington describes it as a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement nonoperatic musicedit andré gill suggesting that wagners music was earsplitting cover of léclipse  april  apart from his operas wagner composed relatively few pieces of music these include a symphony in c major written at the age of

accompanimentn  more rarely performed are the american centennial march  and das liebesmahl der apostel the love feast of the apostles a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in  for the city of dresden after completing parsifal wagner expressed his intention to turn to the writing of symphonies and several sketches dating from the late s and early s have been identified as work towards this end the overtures and certain orchestral passages from wagners middle and latestage operas are commonly played as concert pieces for most of these wagner wrote or rewrote short passages to ensure

wagners maximalization of the temporal and the sonorous in music to the world of the symphony the harmonic revolutions of claude debussy and arnold schoenberg both of whose oeuvres contain examples of tonal and atonal modernism have often been traced back to tristan and parsifal the italian form of operatic realism known as verismo owed much to the wagnerian concept of musical form wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting his essay about conducting  advanced hector berliozs technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be reinterpreted rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison he exemplified this approach in his own conducting which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of felix mendelssohn in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon such as the rewriting of scoresn  wilhelm furtwängler felt that wagner and bülow through their

cinemaedit wagners concept of the use of leitmotifs and the integrated musical expression which they can enable has influenced many th and st century film scores the critic theodor adorno has noted

musical life divided into two factions supporters of wagner and supporters of johannes brahms the latter with the support of the powerful critic eduard hanslick of whom beckmesser in meistersinger is in part a caricature championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against wagnerian innovations they were supported by the conservative leanings of some german music schools including the conservatories at leipzig under ignaz moscheles and at cologne under the direction of ferdinand hiller another wagner detractor was the french composer charlesvalentin alkan who wrote to hiller after attending wagners paris concert on  january  at which wagner conducted the overtures to der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser the preludes to lohengrin and tristan und isolde and six other extracts from tannhäuser and lohengrin i had imagined that i was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of berlioz  i do not like all the music of berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects  but here he was imitated and caricatured  wagner is not a musician he is a disease even those who like debussy opposed wagner this old poisoner could not deny his influence indeed debussy was one of many composers including tchaikovsky who felt the need to break with wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming golliwoggs cakewalk from debussys childrens corner piano suite contains a deliberately tongueincheek quotation from the opening bars of tristan others who proved

particularly in germany during the th century has continued racism and antisemitismedit caricature of wagner by karl clic in the viennese satirical magazine humoristische blätter  the exaggerated features refer to rumours of wagners jewish ancestry wagners writings on jews including jewishness in music corresponded to some existing trends of thought in germany during the th century however despite his very public views on these themes throughout his life wagner had jewish friends colleagues and supporters there have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in wagners operas the characters of mime in the ring sixtus beckmesser in die meistersinger and klingsor in parsifal are sometimes claimed as jewish representations though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operasn  the topic of wagner and the jews is further complicated by allegations which may have been credited by wagner that he himself was of jewish ancestry via his supposed father geyer some biographers have noted that wagner in his final years developed interest in the racialist philosophy of arthur de gobineau notably gobineaus belief that western society was doomed because of miscegenation between superior and inferior races according to robert gutman this theme is reflected in the opera parsifal other biographers such as lucy beckett believe that this is not true as the original drafts of the story date back to  and wagner had completed the libretto for parsifal by  but he displayed no significant interest in gobineau until  other interpretationsedit

wagner as an example of bourgeois false consciousness alienating art from its social context the writer robert donington has produced a detailed if controversial jungian interpretation of the ring

jeanjacques nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of wagners life and works nazi appropriationedit adolf hitler was an admirer of wagners music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the german nation in a  speech he claimed that wagners works glorified the heroic teutonic nature  greatness lies in the heroic hitler visited bayreuth frequently from

wagners daughter eva in  but never met wagner was the author of the racist book the foundations of the nineteenth century approved by the nazi movement chamberlain met hitler on a number of occasions between  and  in bayreuth but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of wagners own views the nazis used those parts of wagners thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest while bayreuth presented a useful front for nazi culture and wagners music was used at many nazi events the nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share hitlers enthusiasm for wagners operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at hitlers insistence guido fackler has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that wagners music was used at the dachau concentration camp in – to reeducate political prisoners by exposure to national music there has been no evidence to support claims sometimes made that his music was played at nazi death camps during the second world war and pamela potter has noted that wagners music was explicitly offlimits in the campsn  because of the associations of wagner with antisemitism and nazism the performance of his music in the state of israel has been a source of controversy see alsoedit richard wagner – wikipedia book notesedit  of their children two carl gustave and maria theresia died as infants the others were wagners brothers albert and carl julius and his sisters rosalie luise clara and ottilie except for carl julius becoming a goldsmith all his siblings developed careers connected with the stage wagner also had a younger halfsister caecilie born in  to his mother and her second husband geyer see also wagner family tree  this sketch is referred to alternatively as leubald und adelaide  wagner claimed to have seen schröderdevrient in the title role of fidelio but it seems more likely that he saw her performance as romeo in bellinis i capuleti e i montecchi  röckel and bakunin failed to escape and endured long terms of imprisonment  gutman records him as suffering from constipation and shingles  the influence was noted by nietzsche in his on the genealogy of morality the fascinating position of schopenhauer on art  was apparently the reason richard wagner first moved over to schopenhauer  that shift was so great that it opened up a complete theoretical contrast between his earlier and his later aesthetic beliefs  for example the selfrenouncing cobblerpoet hans sachs in die meistersinger von nürnberg is a schopenhauerian creation schopenhauer asserted that goodness and salvation result from renunciation of the world and turning against and denying ones own will  eg my dearest beloved my beloved my most glorious friend and o holy one i worship you  wagner excused himself in  when discussing this correspondence with cosima by saying the tone wasnt good but i didnt set it  wagner claimed to be unable to travel to the funeral due to an inflamed finger  cosimas birthday was  december but she usually celebrated it on christmas day  in his  essay on the designation music drama he criticises the term music drama suggesting instead the phrase deeds of music made visible  for the reworking of der fliegende holländer see deathridge    for that of tannhäuser see millington  – which further cites wagners comment to cosima three weeks before his death that he still owes the world tannhäuser see also the articles on these operas in wikipedia  see performance listings by opera in operabase and the wikipedia articles the flying dutchman discography tannhäuser discography and lohengrin discography  for example der fliegende holländer dutchman was first performed in london in  and in the us philadelphia in  tannhäuser in new york in  and in london in  lohengrin in new york in  and london in  for detailed performance histories including other countries see stanford university wagner site under each opera  normally the orchestration by felix mottl is used score available at imslp website although wagner arranged one of the songs for chamber orchestra  see for example wagners proposals for the rescoring of beethovens ninth symphony in his essay on that work  see overture to the flying dutchman as sightread by a bad spa orchestra at  in the morning by the well  weiner  gives very detailed allegations of antisemitism in wagners music and characterisations  shaws anglicization of nibelheim the empire of alberich in the ring cycle  see žižek  viii in this book for the first time the marxist reading of a musical work of art  was combined with the highest musicological analysis  the claim that hitler in his maturity commented that it ie his political career all began after seeing a performance of rienzi in his youth has been disproved  see eg john  for a detailed essay on music in the nazi death camps which nowhere mentions wagner see also potter   we know from testimonies that concentration camp orchestras played all sorts of music  but that wagner was explicitly offlimits however after the war unsubstantiated claims that wagners music accompanied jews to their death took on momentum referencesedit citationsedit

known music dramas unlike most opera composers wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic

family in leipzig where his family lived at no  the brühl the house of the red and white lions in the jewish quarter he was baptized at st thomas church he was the ninth child of carl friedrich wagner who was a clerk in the leipzig police service and his wife johanna rosine née paetz the daughter of a bakern  wagners father carl died of typhus six months after richards birth afterwards his mother johanna lived with carls friend the actor and playwright ludwig geyer in august  johanna and geyer probably married—although no documentation of this has been found in the leipzig church registers she and her family moved to geyers residence in dresden until he was fourteen wagner was known as wilhelm richard geyer he almost certainly thought that geyer was his biological father geyers love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson and wagner took part in his performances in his autobiography mein leben wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel in late  wagner was enrolled at pastor wetzels school at possendorf near dresden where he received some piano instruction from his latin teacher he struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear following geyers death in  richard was sent to the kreuzschule the boarding school of the dresdner kreuzchor at the expense of geyers brother at the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the gothic elements of carl maria von webers opera der freischütz which he saw weber conduct at this period wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright his first creative effort listed in the wagnerwerkverzeichnis the standard listing of wagners works as wwv  was a tragedy called leubald begun when he was in school in  the play was strongly influenced by shakespeare and goethe wagner was determined to set it to music and persuaded his family to allow him music lessonsn  by  the family had returned to leipzig wagners first lessons in harmony were taken during – with christian gottlieb müller in january  he first heard beethovens th symphony and then in march the same composers th symphony both at the gewandhaus beethoven became a major inspiration and wagner wrote a piano transcription of the th symphony he was also greatly impressed by a performance of mozarts requiem wagners early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period in  he saw a performance by dramatic soprano wilhelmine schröderdevrient and she became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera in mein leben wagner wrote when i look back across my entire life i find no event to place beside this in the impression it produced on me and claimed that the profoundly human and ecstatic performance of this incomparable artist kindled in him an almost demonic firen  in  wagner enrolled at the leipzig university where he became a member of the saxon student fraternity he took composition lessons with the thomaskantor theodor weinlig weinlig was so impressed with wagners musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons he arranged for his pupils piano sonata in bflat major which was consequently dedicated to him to be published as wagners op  a year later wagner composed his symphony in c major a beethovenesque work performed in prague in  and at the leipzig gewandhaus in  he then began to work on an opera die hochzeit the wedding which he never completed early career and marriage –edit wilhelmine minna planer  by alexander von otterstedt in  wagners brother albert managed to obtain for him a position as choir master at the theatre in würzburg in the same year at the age of  wagner composed his first complete opera die feen the fairies this work which imitated the style of weber went unproduced until half a century later when it was premiered in munich shortly after the composers death in  having returned to leipzig in  wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in magdeburg during which he wrote das liebesverbot the ban on love based on shakespeares measure for measure this was staged at magdeburg in  but closed before the second performance this together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him left the composer in bankruptcy wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at magdeburg the actress christine wilhelmine minna planer and after the disaster of das liebesverbot he followed her to königsberg where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre the two married in tragheim church on  november  in may  minna left wagner for another man and this was but only the first débâcle of a tempestuous marriage in june  wagner moved to riga then in the russian empire where he became music director of the local opera having in this capacity engaged minnas sister amalie also a singer for the theatre he presently resumed relations with minna during  by  the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled riga on the run from creditors debts would plague wagner for most of his life initially they took a stormy sea passage to london from which wagner drew the inspiration for his opera der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman with a plot based on a sketch by heinrich heine the wagners settled in paris in september  and stayed there until  wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as a pilgrimage to beethoven which sketched his growing concept of music drama and an end in paris where he depicts his own miseries as a german musician in the french metropolis he also provided arrangements of operas by other composers largely on behalf of the schlesinger publishing house during this stay he completed his third and fourth operas rienzi and der fliegende holländer dresden –edit wagner c  by ernest benedikt kietz wagner had completed rienzi in  with the strong support of giacomo meyerbeer it was accepted for performance by the dresden court theatre hofoper in the kingdom of saxony and in  wagner moved to dresden his relief at returning to germany was recorded in his autobiographic sketch of  where he wrote that en route from paris for the first time i saw the rhine—with hot tears in my eyes i poor artist swore eternal fidelity to my german fatherland rienzi was staged to considerable acclaim on  october wagner lived in dresden for the next six years eventually being appointed the royal saxon court conductor during this period he staged there der fliegende holländer  january  and tannhäuser  october  the first two of his three middleperiod operas wagner also mixed with artistic circles in dresden including the composer ferdinand hiller and the architect gottfried semper wagners involvement in leftwing politics abruptly ended his welcome in dresden wagner was active among socialist german nationalists there regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor august röckel and the russian anarchist mikhail bakunin he was also influenced by the ideas of pierrejoseph proudhon and ludwig feuerbach widespread discontent came to a head in  when the unsuccessful may uprising in dresden broke out in which wagner played a minor supporting role warrants were issued for the revolutionaries arrest wagner had to flee first visiting paris and then settling in zürichn  where he at first took refuge with a friend alexander müller in exile switzerland –edit warrant for the arrest of richard wagner issued on  may  wagner was to spend the next twelve years in exile from germany he had completed lohengrin the last of his middleperiod operas before the dresden uprising and now wrote desperately to his friend franz liszt to have it staged in his absence liszt conducted the premiere in weimar in august  nevertheless wagner was in grim personal straits isolated from the german musical world and without any regular income in  julie the wife of his friend karl ritter began to pay him a small pension which she maintained until  with help from her friend jessie laussot this was to have been augmented to an annual sum of  thalers per year but this plan was abandoned when wagner began an affair with mme laussot wagner even planned an elopement with her in  which her husband prevented meanwhile wagners wife minna who had disliked the operas he had written after rienzi was falling into a deepening depression wagner fell victim to illhealth according to ernest newman largely a matter of overwrought nerves which made it difficult for him to continue writingn  wagners primary published output during his first years in zürich was a set of essays in the artwork of the future  he described a vision of opera as gesamtkunstwerk total work of art in which the various arts such as music song dance poetry visual arts and stagecraft were unified judaism in music  was the first of wagners writings to feature antisemitic views in this polemic wagner argued frequently using traditional antisemitic abuse that jews had no connection to the german spirit and were thus capable of producing only shallow and artificial music according to him they composed music to achieve popularity and thereby financial success as opposed to creating genuine works of art in opera and drama  wagner described the aesthetics of drama that he was using to create the ring operas before leaving dresden wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen he initially wrote the libretto for a single opera siegfrieds tod siegfrieds death in  after arriving in zürich he expanded the story with the opera der junge siegfried young siegfried which explored the heros background he completed the text of the cycle by writing the libretti for die walküre the valkyrie and das rheingold the rhine gold and revising the other libretti to agree with his new concept completing them in  the concept of opera expressed in opera and drama and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written up to and including lohengrin partly in an attempt to explain his change of views wagner published in  the autobiographical a communication to my friends this contained his first public announcement of what was to become the ring cycle i shall never write an opera more as i have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works i will call them dramas  i propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas preceded by a lengthy prelude vorspiel  at a speciallyappointed festival i propose some future time to produce those three dramas with their prelude in the course of three days and a foreevening emphasis in original wagner began composing the music for das rheingold between november  and september  following it immediately with die walküre written between june  and march  he began work on the third ring opera which he now called simply siegfried probably in september  but by june  he had completed only the first two acts he decided to put the work aside to concentrate on a new idea tristan und isolde based on the arthurian love story tristan and iseult portrait of mathilde wesendonck  by karl ferdinand sohn one source of inspiration for tristan und isolde was the philosophy of arthur schopenhauer notably his the world as will and representation to which wagner had been introduced in  by his poet friend georg herwegh wagner later called this the most important event of his life his personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be schopenhauers philosophy a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition he remained an adherent of schopenhauer for the rest of his life one of schopenhauers doctrines was that music held a supreme role in the arts as a direct expression of the worlds essence namely blind impulsive will this doctrine contradicted wagners view expressed in opera and drama that the music in opera had to be subservient to the drama wagner scholars have argued that schopenhauers influence caused wagner to assign a more commanding role to music in his later operas including the latter half of the ring cycle which he had yet to composen  aspects of schopenhauerian doctrine found their way into wagners subsequent librettin  a second source of inspiration was wagners infatuation with the poetwriter mathilde wesendonck the wife of the silk merchant otto wesendonck wagner met the wesendoncks who were both great admirers of his music in zürich in  from may  onwards wesendonck made several loans to wagner to finance his household expenses in zürich and in  placed a cottage on his estate at wagners disposal which became known as the asyl asylum or place of rest during this period wagners growing passion for his patrons wife inspired him to put aside work on the ring cycle which was not resumed for the next twelve years and begin work on tristan while planning the opera wagner composed the wesendonck lieder five songs for voice and piano setting poems by mathilde two of these settings are explicitly subtitled by wagner as studies for tristan und isolde amongst the conducting engagements that wagner undertook for revenue during this period he gave several concerts in  with the london philharmonic society including one before queen victoria the queen enjoyed his tannhäuser overture and spoke with wagner after the concert writing of him in her diary that he was short very quiet wears spectacles  has a very finelydeveloped forehead a hooked nose  projecting chin in exile venice and paris –edit wagner in paris  wagners uneasy affair with mathilde collapsed in  when minna intercepted a letter to mathilde from him after the resulting confrontation with minna wagner left zürich alone bound for venice where he rented an apartment in the palazzo giustinian while minna returned to germany wagners attitude to minna had changed the editor of his correspondence with her john burk has said that she was to him an invalid to be treated with kindness and consideration but except at a distance was a menace to his peace of mind wagner continued his correspondence with mathilde and his friendship with her husband otto who maintained his financial support of the composer in an  letter to mathilde wagner wrote halfsatirically of tristan child this tristan is turning into something terrible this final act—i fear the opera will be banned  only mediocre performances can save me perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad in november  wagner once again moved to paris to oversee production of a new revision of tannhäuser staged thanks to the efforts of princess pauline von metternich whose husband was the austrian ambassador in paris the performances of the paris tannhäuser in  were a notable fiasco this was partly a consequence of the conservative tastes of the jockey club which organised demonstrations in the theatre to protest at the presentation of the ballet feature in act  instead of its traditional location in the second act but the opportunity was also exploited by those who wanted to use the occasion as a veiled political protest against the proaustrian policies of napoleon iii it was during this visit that wagner met the french poet charles baudelaire who wrote an appreciative brochure richard wagner et tannhäuser à paris the opera was withdrawn after the third performance and wagner left paris soon after he had sought a reconciliation with minna during this paris visit and although she joined him there the reunion was not successful and they again parted from each other when wagner left return and resurgence –edit the political ban that had been placed on wagner in germany after he had fled dresden was fully lifted in  the composer settled in biebrich on the rhine near wiesbaden in hesse here minna visited him for the last time they parted irrevocably though wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in dresden until her death in  portrait of ludwig ii of bavaria about the time when he first met wagner by ferdinand von piloty  in biebrich wagner at last began work on die meistersinger von nürnberg his only mature comedy wagner wrote a first draft of the libretto in  and he had resolved to develop it during a visit he had made to venice with the wesendoncks in  where he was inspired by titians painting the assumption of the virgin throughout this period – wagner sought to have tristan und isolde produced in vienna despite numerous rehearsals the opera remained unperformed and gained a reputation as being impossible to sing which added to wagners financial problems wagners fortunes took a dramatic upturn in  when king ludwig ii succeeded to the throne of bavaria at the age of  the young king an ardent admirer of wagners operas had the composer brought to munich the king who was homosexual expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composern  and wagner in his responses had no scruples about counterfeiting a similar atmospheren  ludwig settled wagners considerable debts and proposed to stage tristan die meistersinger the ring and the other operas wagner planned wagner also began to dictate his autobiography mein leben at the kings request wagner noted that his rescue by ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor but later supposed enemy giacomo meyerbeer and regretted that this operatic master who had done me so much harm should not have lived to see this day after grave difficulties in rehearsal tristan und isolde premiered at the national theatre munich on  june  the first wagner opera premiere in almost  years the premiere had been scheduled for  may but was delayed by bailiffs acting for wagners creditors and also because the isolde malvina schnorr von carolsfeld was hoarse and needed time to recover the conductor of this premiere was hans von bülow whose wife cosima had given birth in april that year to a daughter named isolde a child not of bülow but of wagner cosima was  years younger than wagner and was herself illegitimate the daughter of the countess marie dagoult who had left her husband for franz liszt liszt initially disapproved of his daughters involvement with wagner though nevertheless the two men were friends the indiscreet affair scandalised munich and wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court who were suspicious of his influence on the king in december  ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave munich he apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile but wagner quickly dissuaded him richard and cosima wagner photographed in  ludwig installed wagner at the villa tribschen beside switzerlands lake lucerne die meistersinger was completed at tribschen in  and premiered in munich on  june the following year at ludwigs insistence special previews of the first two works of the ring das rheingold and die walküre were performed at munich in  and  but wagner retained his dream first expressed in a communication to my friends to present the first complete cycle at a special festival with a new dedicated opera house minna had died of a heart attack on  january  in dresden wagner did not attend the funeraln  following minnas death cosima wrote to hans von bülow on a number of occasions asking him to grant her a divorce but bülow refused to concede this he only consented after she had two more children with wagner another daughter named eva after the heroine of meistersinger and a son siegfried named for the hero of the ring the divorce was finally sanctioned after delays in the legal process by a berlin court on  july  richard and cosimas wedding took place on  august  on christmas day of that year wagner arranged a surprise performance its premiere of the siegfried idyll for cosimas birthdayn  the marriage to cosima lasted to the end of wagners life wagner settled into his newfound domesticity turned his energies towards completing the ring cycle he had not abandoned polemics he republished his  pamphlet judaism in music originally issued under a pseudonym under his own name in  he extended the introduction and wrote a lengthy additional final section the publication led to several public protests at early performances of die meistersinger in vienna and mannheim bayreuth –edit in  wagner decided to move to bayreuth which was to be the location of his new opera house the town council donated a large plot of land—the green hill—as a site for the theatre the wagners moved to the town the following year and the foundation stone for the bayreuth festspielhaus festival theatre was laid wagner initially announced the first bayreuth festival at which for the first time the ring cycle would be presented complete for  but since ludwig had declined to finance the project the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the festival was deferred to raise funds for the construction wagner societies were formed in several cities and wagner began touring germany conducting concerts by the spring of  only a third of the required funds had been raised further pleas to ludwig were initially ignored but early in  with the project on the verge of collapse the king relented and provided a loan the full building programme included the family home wahnfried into which wagner with cosima and the children moved from their temporary accommodation on  april  the theatre was completed in  and the festival scheduled for the following year commenting on the struggle to finish the building wagner remarked to cosima each stone is red with my blood and yours the bayreuth festspielhaus photochrom print of c  for the design of the festspielhaus wagner appropriated some of the ideas of his former colleague gottfried semper which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at munich wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at bayreuth these include darkening the auditorium during performances and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience the festspielhaus finally opened on  august  with das rheingold at last taking its place as the first evening of the complete ring cycle the  bayreuth festival therefore saw the premiere of the complete cycle performed as a sequence as the composer had intended the  festival consisted of three full ring cycles under the baton of hans richter at the end critical reactions ranged between that of the norwegian composer edvard grieg who thought the work divinely composed and that of the french newspaper le figaro which called the music the dream of a lunatic amongst the disillusioned were wagners friend and disciple friedrich nietzsche who having published his eulogistic essay richard wagner in bayreuth before the festival as part of his untimely meditations was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as wagners pandering to increasingly exclusivist german nationalism his breach with wagner began at this time the festival firmly established wagner as an artist of european and indeed world importance attendees included kaiser wilhelm i the emperor pedro ii of brazil anton bruckner camille saintsaëns and pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky wagner was far from satisfied with the festival cosima recorded that months later his attitude towards the productions was never again never again moreover the festival finished with a deficit of about  marks the expenses of bayreuth and of wahnfried meant that wagner still sought additional sources of income by conducting or taking on commissions such as the centennial march for america for which he received  last years –edit following the first bayreuth festival wagner began work on parsifal his final opera the composition took four years much of which wagner spent in italy for health reasons from  to  wagner also embarked on the last of his documented emotional liaisons this time with judith gautier whom he had met at the  festival wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing parsifal and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than bayreuth he was once again assisted by the liberality of king ludwig but was still forced by his personal financial situation in  to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works including the siegfried idyll to the publisher schott the wagner grave in the wahnfried garden in  cosimas ashes were placed alongside wagners body wagner wrote a number of articles in his later years often on political topics and often reactionary in tone repudiating some of his earlier more liberal views these include religion and art  and heroism and christianity  which were printed in the journal bayreuther blätter published by his supporter hans von wolzogen wagners sudden interest in christianity at this period which infuses parsifal was contemporary with his increasing alignment with german nationalism and required on his part and the part of his associates the rewriting of some recent wagnerian history so as to represent for example the ring as a work reflecting christian ideals many of these later articles including what is german  but based on a draft written in the s repeated wagners antisemitic preoccupations wagner completed parsifal in january  and a second bayreuth festival was held for the new opera which premiered on  may wagner was by this time extremely ill having suffered a series of increasingly severe angina attacks during the sixteenth and final performance of parsifal on  august he entered the pit unseen during act  took the baton from conductor hermann levi and led the performance to its conclusion after the festival the wagner family journeyed to venice for the winter wagner died of a heart attack at the age of  on  february  at ca vendramin calergi a thcentury palazzo on the grand canal the legend that the attack was prompted by argument with cosima over wagners supposedly amorous interest in the singer carrie pringle who had been a flowermaiden in parsifal at bayreuth is without credible evidence after a funerary gondola bore wagners remains

of the hero of wagners opera siegfried wagners operatic works are his primary artistic legacy unlike most opera composers who generally left the task of writing the libretto the text and lyrics to others wagner wrote his own libretti which he referred to as poems from  onwards he urged a new concept of opera often referred to as music drama although he later rejected this termn  in which all musical poetic and dramatic elements were to be fused together—the gesamtkunstwerk wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers the orchestras dramatic role in the later operas includes the use of leitmotifs musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters locales and plot elements their complex interweaving and evolution illuminates the progression of the drama these operas are still despite wagners reservations referred to by many writers as music dramas early works to edit wagners earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on goethes die laune des verliebten the infatuated lovers caprice written at the age of  die hochzeit the wedding on which wagner worked in  and the singspiel männerlist größer als frauenlist men are more cunning than women – die feen the fairies  was unperformed in the composers lifetime and das liebesverbot the ban on love  was withdrawn after its first performance rienzi  was wagners first opera to be successfully staged the compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated rienzi showing the clear influence of grand opera à la spontini and meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark wagners place in musical history later in life wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his oeuvre none of them has ever been performed at the bayreuth festival and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years although the overture to rienzi is an occasional concert piece die feen das liebesverbot and rienzi were performed at both leipzig and bayreuth in  to mark the composers bicentenary romantic operas –edit opening of overture to der fliegende holländer in wagners hand and with his notes to the publisher wagners middle stage output began with der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman  followed by tannhäuser  and lohengrin  these three operas are sometimes referred to as wagners romantic operas they reinforced the reputation among the public in germany and beyond that wagner had begun to establish with rienzi although distancing himself from the style of these operas from  onwards he nevertheless reworked both der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser on several occasionsn  these three operas are considered to represent a significant developmental stage in wagners musical and operatic maturity as regards thematic handling portrayal of emotions and orchestration they are the earliest works included in the bayreuth canon the mature operas that cosima staged at the bayreuth festival after wagners death in accordance with his wishes all three including the differing versions of der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser continue to be regularly performed throughout the world and have been frequently recordedn  they were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetimen  music dramas –edit starting the ringedit main articles der ring des nibelungen der ring des nibelungen composition of the music and der ring des nibelungen composition of the poem brünnhilde the valkyrie as illustrated by arthur rackham  wagners late dramas are considered his masterpieces der ring des nibelungen commonly referred to as the ring or ring cycle is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of germanic mythology—particularly from the later norse mythology—notably the old norse poetic edda and volsunga saga and the middle high german nibelungenlied wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of stabreim highly alliterative rhyming versepairs used in old germanic poetry they were also influenced by wagners concepts of ancient greek drama in which tetralogies were a component of athenian festivals and which he had amply discussed in his essay oper und drama the first two components of the ring cycle were das rheingold the rhinegold which was completed in  and die walküre the valkyrie which was finished in  in das rheingold with its relentlessly talky realism and the absence of lyrical numbers wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his – essays die walküre which contains what is virtually a traditional aria siegmunds winterstürme in the first act and the quasichoral appearance of the valkyries themselves shows more operatic traits but has been assessed by barry millington as the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of oper und drama a thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression tristan und isolde and die meistersingeredit while composing the opera siegfried the third part of the ring cycle wagner interrupted work on it and between  and  wrote the tragic love story tristan und isolde and his only mature comedy die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon franz betz who created the role of hans sachs in die meistersinger and sang wotan in the first complete ring cycle tristan is often granted a special place in musical history many see it as the beginning of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the th century wagner felt that his musicodramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of the art of transition between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines completed in  the work was given its first performance in munich conducted by bülow in june  die meistersinger was originally conceived by wagner in  as a sort of comic pendant to tannhäuser like tristan it was premiered in munich under the baton of bülow on  june  and became an immediate success barry millington describes meistersinger as a rich perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity but because of its strong german nationalist overtones it is also cited by some as an example of wagners reactionary politics and antisemitism completing the ringedit when wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of siegfried and for götterdämmerung twilight of the gods as the final part of the ring his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as operatic than the aural world of rheingold and walküre though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs this was in part because the libretti of the four ring operas had been written in reverse order so that the book for götterdämmerung was conceived more traditionally than that of rheingold still the selfimposed strictures of the gesamtkunstwerk had become relaxed the differences also result from wagners development as a composer during the period in which he wrote tristan meistersinger and the paris version of tannhäuser from act  of siegfried onwards the ring becomes more chromatic melodically more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs wagner took  years from writing the first draft of a libretto in  until he completed götterdämmerung in  the ring takes about  hours to perform and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the worlds stages parsifaledit wagners final opera parsifal  which was his only work written especially for his bayreuth festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a bühnenweihfestspiel festival play for the consecration of the stage has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the holy grail it also carries elements of buddhist renunciation suggested by wagners readings of schopenhauer wagner described it to cosima as his last card it remains controversial because of its treatment of christianity its eroticism and its expression as perceived by some commentators of german nationalism and antisemitism despite the composers own description of the opera to king ludwig as this most christian of works ulrike kienzle has commented that wagners turn to christian mythology upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of parsifal rest is idiosyncratic and contradicts christian dogma in many ways musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composers style and barry millington describes it as a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement nonoperatic musicedit andré gill suggesting that wagners music was earsplitting cover of léclipse  april  apart from his operas wagner composed relatively few pieces of music these include a symphony in c major written at the age of  the faust overture the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject some overtures and choral and piano pieces his most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the siegfried idyll for chamber orchestra which has several motifs in common with the ring cycle the wesendonck lieder are also often performed either in the original piano version or with orchestral accompanimentn  more rarely performed are the american centennial march  and das liebesmahl der apostel the love feast of the apostles a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in  for the city of dresden after completing parsifal wagner expressed his intention to turn to the writing of symphonies and several sketches dating from the late s and early s have been identified as work towards this end the overtures and certain orchestral passages from wagners middle and latestage operas are commonly played as concert pieces for most of these wagner wrote or rewrote short passages to ensure musical coherence the bridal chorus from lohengrin is frequently played as the brides processional wedding march in englishspeaking countries prose writingsedit see also categoryessays by richard

that were an embarrassment to him eg those praising meyerbeer or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce wagners own account of his progress wagners autobiography mein leben was originally published for close friends only in a very small edition – copies per volume in four volumes between  and  the first public edition with many passages suppressed by cosima appeared in  the first attempt at a full edition in german appeared in  there have been modern complete or partial editions of wagners writings including a centennial edition in german edited by dieter borchmeyer which however omitted the essay das judenthum in der musik and mein leben the english translations of wagners prose in eight volumes by w ashton ellis – are still in print and commonly used despite their deficiencies a complete edition of wagners correspondence estimated to amount to between  and  items is still under way under the supervision of the institute for music research at the university of würzburg as of november   volumes have appeared covering the period to  influence and legacyedit influence on musicedit the opening of tristan und isolde featuring the tristan chord problems playing this file see media help wagners later musical style introduced new ideas in harmony melodic process leitmotif and operatic structure notably from tristan und isolde onwards he explored the limits of the traditional tonal system which gave keys and chords their identity pointing the way to atonality in the th century some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of tristan which include the socalled tristan chord gustav mahler wagner inspired great devotion for a long period many composers were inclined to align themselves with or against wagners music anton bruckner and hugo wolf were greatly indebted to him as were césar franck henri duparc ernest chausson jules massenet richard strauss alexander von zemlinsky hans pfitzner and numerous others gustav mahler was devoted to wagner and his music aged  he sought him out on his  visit to vienna became a renowned wagner conductor and his compositions are seen by richard taruskin as extending wagners maximalization of the temporal and the sonorous in music to the world of the symphony the harmonic revolutions of claude debussy and arnold schoenberg both of whose oeuvres contain examples of tonal and atonal modernism have often been traced back to tristan and parsifal the italian form of operatic realism known as verismo owed much to the wagnerian concept of musical form wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting his essay about conducting  advanced hector berliozs technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be reinterpreted rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison he exemplified this approach in his own conducting which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of felix mendelssohn in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon such as the rewriting of scoresn  wilhelm furtwängler felt that wagner and bülow through their interpretative approach inspired a whole new generation of conductors including furtwängler himself amongst those claiming inspiration from wagners music are the german band rammstein and the electronic composer klaus schulze whose  album timewind consists of two minute tracks bayreuth return and wahnfried  joey demaio of the band manowar has described wagner as the father of heavy metal the slovenian group laibach created the  suite volkswagner using material from wagners operas phil spectors wall of sound recording technique was it has been claimed heavily influenced by wagner influence on literature philosophy and the visual artsedit friedrich nietzsche wagners influence on literature and philosophy is significant millington has commented wagners protean abundance meant that he could inspire the use of literary motif in many a novel employing interior monologue  the symbolists saw him as a mystic hierophant the decadents found many a frisson in his work friedrich nietzsche was a member of wagners inner circle during the early s and his first published work the birth of tragedy proposed wagners music as the dionysian rebirth of european culture in opposition to apollonian rationalist decadence nietzsche broke with wagner following the first bayreuth festival believing that wagners final phase represented a pandering to christian pieties and a surrender to the new german reich nietzsche expressed his displeasure with the later wagner in the case of wagner and nietzsche contra wagner charles baudelaire stéphane mallarmé and paul verlaine worshipped wagner édouard dujardin whose influential novel les lauriers sont coupés is in the form of an interior monologue inspired by wagnerian music founded a journal dedicated to wagner la revue wagnérienne to which j k huysmans and téodor de wyzewa contributed in a list of major cultural figures influenced by wagner bryan magee includes d h lawrence aubrey beardsley romain rolland gérard de nerval pierreauguste renoir rainer maria rilke and numerous others unveiling of the richard wagner monument in the tiergarten  by anton von werner in the th century w h auden once called wagner perhaps the greatest genius that ever lived while thomas mann and marcel proust were heavily influenced by him and discussed wagner in their novels he is also discussed in some of the works of james joyce wagnerian themes inhabit t s eliots the waste land which contains lines from tristan und isolde and götterdämmerung and verlaines poem on parsifal many of wagners concepts including his speculation about dreams predated their investigation by sigmund freud wagner had publicly analysed the oedipus myth before freud was born in terms of its psychological significance insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety georg groddeck considered the ring as the first manual of psychoanalysis influence on cinemaedit wagners concept of the use of leitmotifs and the integrated musical expression which they can enable has influenced many th and st century film scores the critic theodor adorno has noted that the wagnerian leitmotif leads directly to cinema music where the sole function of the leitmotif is to announce heroes or situations so as to allow the audience to orient itself more easily amongst film scores citing wagnerian themes are francis ford coppolas apocalypse now which features a version of the ride of the valkyries trevor joness soundtrack to john boormans film excalibur and the  films a dangerous method dir david cronenberg and melancholia dir lars von trier hansjürgen syberbergs  film hitler a film from germanys visual style and set design are strongly inspired by der ring des nibelungen musical excerpts from which are frequently used in the films soundtrack opponents and supportersedit eduard hanslick not all reaction to wagner was positive for a time german musical life divided into two factions supporters of wagner and supporters of johannes brahms the latter with the support of the powerful critic eduard hanslick of whom beckmesser in meistersinger is in part a caricature championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against wagnerian innovations they were supported by the conservative leanings of some german music schools including the conservatories at leipzig under ignaz moscheles and at cologne under the direction of ferdinand hiller another wagner detractor was the french composer charlesvalentin alkan who wrote to hiller after attending wagners paris concert on  january  at which wagner conducted the overtures to der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser the preludes to lohengrin and tristan und isolde and six other extracts from tannhäuser and lohengrin i had imagined that i was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of berlioz  i do not like all the music of berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects  but here he was imitated and caricatured  wagner is not a musician he is a disease even those who like debussy opposed wagner this old poisoner could not deny his influence indeed debussy was one of many composers including tchaikovsky who felt the need to break with wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming golliwoggs cakewalk from debussys childrens corner piano suite contains a deliberately tongueincheek quotation from the opening bars of tristan others who proved resistant to wagners operas included gioachino rossini who said wagner has wonderful moments and dreadful quarters of an hour in the th century wagners music was parodied by paul hindemithn  and hanns eisler among others wagners followers known as wagnerians or wagnerites have formed many societies dedicated to wagners life and work film and stage portrayalsedit main article list of films about richard wagner wagner has been the subject of many biographical films the earliest was a silent film made by carl froelich in  and featured in the title role the composer giuseppe becce who also wrote the score for the film as wagners music still in copyright was not available amongst other film portrayals of wagner are alan badel in magic fire  lyndon brook in song without end  trevor howard in ludwig  paul nicholas in lisztomania  and richard burton in wagner  jonathan harveys opera wagner dream  intertwines the events surrounding wagners death with the story of wagners uncompleted opera outline die sieger the victors bayreuth festivaledit main article bayreuth festival since wagners death the bayreuth festival which has become an annual event has been successively directed by his widow his son siegfried the latters widow winifred wagner their two sons wieland and wolfgang wagner and presently two of the composers greatgranddaughters eva wagnerpasquier and katharina wagner since  the festival has been overseen by the richardwagnerstiftung richard wagner foundation the members of which include a number of wagners descendants controversiesedit main article wagner controversies wagners operas writings politics beliefs and unorthodox lifestyle made him a controversial figure during his lifetime following his death debate about his ideas and their interpretation particularly in germany during the th century has continued racism and antisemitismedit caricature of wagner by karl clic in the viennese satirical magazine humoristische blätter  the exaggerated features refer to rumours of wagners jewish ancestry wagners writings on jews including jewishness in music corresponded to some existing trends of thought in germany during the th century however despite his very public views on these themes throughout his life wagner had jewish friends colleagues and supporters there have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in wagners operas the characters of mime in the ring sixtus beckmesser in die meistersinger and klingsor in parsifal are sometimes claimed as jewish representations though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operasn  the topic of wagner and the jews is further complicated by allegations which may have been credited by wagner that he himself was of jewish ancestry via his supposed father geyer some biographers have noted that wagner in his final years developed interest in the racialist philosophy of arthur de gobineau notably gobineaus belief that western society was doomed because of miscegenation between superior and inferior races according to robert gutman this theme is reflected in the opera parsifal other biographers such as lucy beckett believe that this is not true as the original drafts of the story date back to  and wagner had completed the libretto for parsifal by  but he displayed no significant interest in gobineau until  other interpretationsedit wagners ideas are amenable to socialist interpretations many of his ideas on art were being formulated at the time of his revolutionary inclinations in the s thus for example george bernard shaw wrote in the perfect wagnerite  wagners picture of niblunghomen  under the reign of alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it was made known in germany in the middle of the th century by engelss book the condition of the working class in england leftwing interpretations of wagner also inform the writings of theodor adorno among other wagner criticsn  walter benjamin gave wagner as an example of bourgeois false consciousness alienating art from its social context the writer robert donington has produced a detailed if controversial jungian interpretation of the ring cycle described as an approach to wagner by way of his symbols which for example sees the character of the goddess fricka as part of her husband wotans inner femininity millington notes that jeanjacques nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of wagners life and works nazi appropriationedit adolf hitler was an admirer of wagners music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the german nation in a  speech he claimed that wagners works glorified the heroic teutonic nature  greatness lies in the heroic hitler visited bayreuth frequently from  onwards and attended the productions at the theatre there continues to be debate about the extent to which wagners views might have influenced nazi thinkingn  houston stewart chamberlain – who married wagners daughter eva in  but never met wagner was the author of the racist book the foundations of the nineteenth century approved by the nazi movement chamberlain met hitler on a number of occasions between  and  in bayreuth but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of wagners own views the nazis used those parts of wagners thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest while bayreuth presented a useful front for nazi culture and wagners music was used at many nazi events the nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share hitlers enthusiasm for wagners operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at hitlers insistence guido fackler has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that wagners music was used at the dachau concentration camp in – to reeducate political prisoners by exposure to national music there has been no evidence to support claims sometimes made that his music was played at nazi death camps during the second world war and pamela potter has noted that wagners music was explicitly offlimits in the campsn  because of the associations of wagner with antisemitism and nazism the performance of his music in the state of israel has been a source of controversy see alsoedit richard wagner – wikipedia book notesedit  of their children two carl gustave and maria theresia died as infants the others were wagners brothers albert and carl julius and his sisters rosalie luise clara and ottilie except for carl julius becoming a goldsmith all his siblings developed careers connected with the stage wagner also had a younger halfsister caecilie born in  to his mother and her second husband geyer see also wagner family tree  this sketch is referred to alternatively as leubald und adelaide  wagner claimed to have seen schröderdevrient in the title role of fidelio but it seems more likely that he saw her performance as romeo in bellinis i capuleti e i montecchi  röckel and bakunin failed to escape and endured long terms of imprisonment  gutman records him as suffering from constipation and shingles  the influence was noted by nietzsche in his on the genealogy of morality the fascinating position of schopenhauer on art  was apparently the reason richard wagner first moved over to schopenhauer  that shift was so great that it opened up a complete theoretical contrast between his earlier and his later aesthetic beliefs  for example the selfrenouncing cobblerpoet hans sachs in die meistersinger von nürnberg is a schopenhauerian creation schopenhauer asserted that goodness and salvation result from renunciation of the world and turning against and denying ones own will  eg my dearest beloved my beloved my most glorious friend and o holy one i worship you  wagner excused himself in  when discussing this correspondence with cosima by saying the tone wasnt good but i didnt set it  wagner claimed to be unable to travel to the funeral due to an inflamed finger  cosimas birthday was  december but she usually celebrated it on christmas day  in his  essay on the designation music drama he criticises the term music drama suggesting instead the phrase deeds of music made visible  for the reworking of der fliegende holländer see deathridge    for that of tannhäuser see millington  – which further cites wagners comment to cosima three weeks before his death that he still owes the world tannhäuser see also the articles on these operas in wikipedia  see performance listings by opera in operabase and the wikipedia articles the flying dutchman discography tannhäuser discography and lohengrin discography  for example der fliegende holländer dutchman was first performed in london in  and in the us philadelphia in  tannhäuser in new york in  and in london in  lohengrin in new york in  and london in  for detailed performance histories including other countries see stanford university wagner site under each opera  normally the orchestration by felix mottl is used score available at imslp website although wagner arranged one of the songs for chamber orchestra  see for example wagners proposals for the rescoring of beethovens ninth symphony in his essay on that work  see overture to the flying dutchman as sightread by a bad spa orchestra at  in the morning by the well  weiner  gives very detailed allegations of antisemitism in wagners music and characterisations  shaws anglicization of nibelheim the empire of alberich in the ring cycle  see žižek  viii in this book for the first time the marxist reading of a musical work of art  was combined with the highest musicological analysis  the claim that hitler in his maturity commented that it ie his political career all began after seeing a performance of rienzi in his youth has been disproved  see eg john  for a detailed essay on music in the nazi death camps which nowhere mentions wagner see also potter   we know from testimonies that concentration camp orchestras played all sorts of music  but that wagner was explicitly offlimits however after the war unsubstantiated claims that wagners music accompanied jews to their death took on momentum referencesedit citationsedit

wagner ˈvɑːɡnər german ˈʁiçaʁt ˈvaːɡnɐ  may  –  february  was a german composer theatre director polemicist and conductor who is primarily known for his operas or as some of his later works were later known music dramas unlike most opera composers wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of weber and meyerbeer wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the gesamtkunstwerk total work of art by which he sought to synthesise the poetic visual musical and dramatic arts with music subsidiary to drama he described this vision in a series of essays published between  and  wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen the ring of the nibelung his compositions particularly those of his later period are notable for their complex textures rich harmonies and orchestration and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters places ideas or plot elements his advances in musical language such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres greatly influenced the development of classical music his tristan und isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music wagner had his own opera house built the bayreuth festspielhaus which embodied many novel design features the ring and parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual bayreuth festival run by his descendants his thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works including die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg until his final years wagners life was characterised by political exile turbulent love affairs poverty and repeated flight from his creditors his controversial writings on music drama and politics have attracted extensive comment notably since the late th century where they express antisemitic sentiments the effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts

family in leipzig where his family lived at no  the brühl the house of the red and white lions in the jewish quarter he was baptized at st thomas church he was the ninth child of carl friedrich wagner who was a clerk in the leipzig police service and his wife johanna rosine née paetz the daughter of a bakern  wagners father carl died of typhus six months after richards birth afterwards his mother johanna lived with carls friend the actor and playwright ludwig geyer in august  johanna and geyer probably married—although no documentation of this has been found in the leipzig church registers she and her family moved to geyers residence in dresden until he was fourteen wagner was known as wilhelm richard geyer he almost certainly thought that geyer was his biological father geyers love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson and wagner took part in his performances in his autobiography mein leben wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel in late  wagner was enrolled at pastor wetzels school at possendorf near dresden where he received some piano instruction from his latin teacher he struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear following geyers death in  richard was sent to the kreuzschule the boarding school of the dresdner kreuzchor at the expense of geyers brother at the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the gothic elements of carl maria von webers opera der freischütz which he saw weber conduct at this period wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright his first creative effort listed in the wagnerwerkverzeichnis the standard listing of wagners works as wwv  was a tragedy called leubald begun when he was in school in  the play was strongly influenced by shakespeare and goethe wagner was determined to set it to music and persuaded his family to allow him music lessonsn  by  the family had returned to leipzig wagners first lessons in harmony were taken during – with christian gottlieb müller in january  he first heard beethovens th symphony and then in march the same composers th symphony both at the gewandhaus beethoven became a major inspiration and wagner wrote a piano transcription of the th symphony he was also greatly impressed by a performance of mozarts requiem wagners early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period in  he saw a performance by dramatic soprano wilhelmine schröderdevrient and she became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera in mein leben wagner wrote when i look back across my entire life i find no event to place beside this in the impression it produced on me and claimed that the profoundly human and ecstatic performance of this incomparable artist kindled in him an almost demonic firen  in  wagner enrolled at the leipzig university where he became a member of the saxon student fraternity he took composition lessons with the thomaskantor theodor weinlig weinlig was so impressed with wagners musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons he arranged for his pupils piano sonata in bflat major which was consequently dedicated to him to be published as wagners op  a year later wagner composed his symphony in c major a beethovenesque work performed in prague in  and at the leipzig gewandhaus in  he then began to work on an opera die hochzeit the wedding which he never completed early career and marriage –edit wilhelmine minna planer  by alexander von otterstedt in  wagners brother albert managed to obtain for him a position as choir master at the theatre in würzburg in the same year at the age of  wagner composed his first complete opera die feen the fairies this work which imitated the style of weber went unproduced until half a century later when it was premiered in munich shortly after the composers death in  having returned to leipzig in  wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in magdeburg during which he wrote das liebesverbot the ban on love based on shakespeares measure for measure this was staged at magdeburg in  but closed before the second performance this together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him left the composer in bankruptcy wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at magdeburg the actress christine wilhelmine minna planer and after the disaster of das liebesverbot he followed her to königsberg where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre the two married in tragheim church on  november  in may  minna left wagner for another man and this was but only the first débâcle of a tempestuous marriage in june  wagner moved to riga then in the russian empire where he became music director of the local opera having in this capacity engaged minnas sister amalie also a singer for the theatre he presently resumed relations with minna during  by  the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled riga on the run from creditors debts would plague wagner for most of his life initially they took a stormy sea passage to london from which wagner drew the inspiration for his opera der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman with a plot based on a sketch by heinrich heine the wagners settled in paris in september  and stayed there until  wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as a pilgrimage to beethoven which sketched his growing concept of music drama and an end in paris where he depicts his own miseries as a german musician in the french metropolis he also provided arrangements of operas by other composers largely on behalf of the schlesinger publishing house during this stay he completed his third and fourth operas rienzi and der fliegende holländer dresden –edit wagner c  by ernest benedikt kietz wagner had completed rienzi in  with the strong support of giacomo meyerbeer it was accepted for performance by the dresden court theatre hofoper in the kingdom of saxony and in  wagner moved to dresden his relief at returning to germany was recorded in his autobiographic sketch of  where he wrote that en route from paris for the first time i saw the rhine—with hot tears in my eyes i poor artist swore eternal fidelity to my german fatherland rienzi was staged to considerable acclaim on  october wagner lived in dresden for the next six years eventually being appointed the royal saxon court conductor during this period he staged there der fliegende holländer  january  and tannhäuser  october  the first two of his three middleperiod operas wagner also mixed with artistic circles in dresden including the composer ferdinand hiller and the architect gottfried semper wagners involvement in leftwing politics abruptly ended his welcome in dresden wagner was active among socialist german nationalists there regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor august röckel and the russian anarchist mikhail bakunin he was also influenced by the ideas of pierrejoseph proudhon and ludwig feuerbach widespread discontent came to a head in  when the unsuccessful may uprising in dresden broke out in which wagner played a minor supporting role warrants were issued for the revolutionaries arrest wagner had to flee first visiting paris and then settling in zürichn  where he at first took refuge with a friend alexander müller in exile switzerland –edit warrant for the arrest of richard wagner issued on  may  wagner was to spend the next twelve years in exile from germany he had completed lohengrin the last of his middleperiod operas before the dresden uprising and now wrote desperately to his friend franz liszt to have it staged in his absence liszt conducted the premiere in weimar in august  nevertheless wagner was in grim personal straits isolated from the german musical world and without any regular income in  julie the wife of his friend karl ritter began to pay him a small pension which she maintained until  with help from her friend jessie laussot this was to have been augmented to an annual sum of  thalers per year but this plan was abandoned when wagner began an affair with mme laussot wagner even planned an elopement with her in  which her husband prevented meanwhile wagners wife minna who had disliked the operas he had written after rienzi was falling into a deepening depression wagner fell victim to illhealth according to ernest newman largely a matter of overwrought nerves which made it difficult for him to continue writingn  wagners primary published output during his first years in zürich was a set of essays in the artwork of the future  he described a vision of opera as gesamtkunstwerk total work of art in which the various arts such as music song dance poetry visual arts and stagecraft were unified judaism in music  was the first of wagners writings to feature antisemitic views in this polemic wagner argued frequently using traditional antisemitic abuse that jews had no connection to the german spirit and were thus capable of producing only shallow and artificial music according to him they composed music to achieve popularity and thereby financial success as opposed to creating genuine works of art in opera and drama  wagner described the aesthetics of drama that he was using to create the ring operas before leaving dresden wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen he initially wrote the libretto for a single opera siegfrieds tod siegfrieds death in  after arriving in zürich he expanded the story with the opera der junge siegfried young siegfried which explored the heros background he completed the text of the cycle by writing the libretti for die walküre the valkyrie and das rheingold the rhine gold and revising the other libretti to agree with his new concept completing them in  the concept of opera expressed in opera and drama and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written up to and including lohengrin partly in an attempt to explain his change of views wagner published in  the autobiographical a communication to my friends this contained his first public announcement of what was to become the ring cycle i shall never write an opera more as i have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works i will call them dramas  i propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas preceded by a lengthy prelude vorspiel  at a speciallyappointed festival i propose some future time to produce those three dramas with their prelude in the course of three days and a foreevening emphasis in original wagner began composing the music for das rheingold between november  and september  following it immediately with die walküre written between june  and march  he began work on the third ring opera which he now called simply siegfried probably in september  but by june  he had completed only the first two acts he decided to put the work aside to concentrate on a new idea tristan und isolde based on the arthurian love story tristan and iseult portrait of mathilde wesendonck  by karl ferdinand sohn one source of inspiration for tristan und isolde was the philosophy of arthur schopenhauer notably his the world as will and representation to which wagner had been introduced in  by his poet friend georg herwegh wagner later called this the most important event of his life his personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be schopenhauers philosophy a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition he remained an adherent of schopenhauer for the rest of his life one of schopenhauers doctrines was that music held a supreme role in the arts as a direct expression of the worlds essence namely blind impulsive will this doctrine contradicted wagners view expressed in opera and drama that the music in opera had to be subservient to the drama wagner scholars have argued that schopenhauers influence caused wagner to assign a more commanding role to music in his later operas including the latter half of the ring cycle which he had yet to composen  aspects of schopenhauerian doctrine found their way into wagners subsequent librettin  a second source of inspiration was wagners infatuation with the poetwriter mathilde wesendonck the wife of the silk merchant otto wesendonck wagner met the wesendoncks who were both great admirers of his music in zürich in  from may  onwards wesendonck made several loans to wagner to finance his household expenses in zürich and in  placed a cottage on his estate at wagners disposal which became known as the asyl asylum or place of rest during this period wagners growing passion for his patrons wife inspired him to put aside work on the ring cycle which was not resumed for the next twelve years and begin work on tristan while planning the opera wagner composed the wesendonck lieder five songs for voice and piano setting poems by mathilde two of these settings are explicitly subtitled by wagner as studies for tristan und isolde amongst the conducting engagements that wagner undertook for revenue during this period he gave several concerts in  with the london philharmonic society including one before queen victoria the queen enjoyed his tannhäuser overture and spoke with wagner after the concert writing of him in her diary that he was short very quiet wears spectacles  has a very finelydeveloped forehead a hooked nose  projecting chin in exile venice and paris –edit wagner in paris  wagners uneasy affair with mathilde collapsed in  when minna intercepted a letter to mathilde from him after the resulting confrontation with minna wagner left zürich alone bound for venice where he rented an apartment in the palazzo giustinian while minna returned to germany wagners attitude to minna had changed the editor of his correspondence with her john burk has said that she was to him an invalid to be treated with kindness and consideration but except at a distance was a menace to his peace of mind wagner continued his correspondence with mathilde and his friendship with her husband otto who maintained his financial support of the composer in an  letter to mathilde wagner wrote halfsatirically of tristan child this tristan is turning into something terrible this final act—i fear the opera will be banned  only mediocre performances can save me perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad in november  wagner once again moved to paris to oversee production of a new revision of tannhäuser staged thanks to the efforts of princess pauline von metternich whose husband was the austrian ambassador in paris the performances of the paris tannhäuser in  were a notable fiasco this was partly a consequence of the conservative tastes of the jockey club which organised demonstrations in the theatre to protest at the presentation of the ballet feature in act  instead of its traditional location in the second act but the opportunity was also exploited by those who wanted to use the occasion as a veiled political protest against the proaustrian policies of napoleon iii it was during this visit that wagner met the french poet charles baudelaire who wrote an appreciative brochure richard wagner et tannhäuser à paris the opera was withdrawn after the third performance and wagner left paris soon after he had sought a reconciliation with minna during this paris visit and although she joined him there the reunion was not successful and they again parted from each other when wagner left return and resurgence –edit the political ban that had been placed on wagner in germany after he had fled dresden was fully lifted in  the composer settled in biebrich on the rhine near wiesbaden in hesse here minna visited him for the last time they parted irrevocably though wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in dresden until her death in  portrait of ludwig ii of bavaria about the time when he first met wagner by ferdinand von piloty  in biebrich wagner at last began work on die meistersinger von nürnberg his only mature comedy wagner wrote a first draft of the libretto in  and he had resolved to develop it during a visit he had made to venice with the wesendoncks in  where he was inspired by titians painting the assumption of the virgin throughout this period – wagner sought to have tristan und isolde produced in vienna despite numerous rehearsals the opera remained unperformed and gained a reputation as being impossible to sing which added to wagners financial problems wagners fortunes took a dramatic upturn in  when king ludwig ii succeeded to the throne of bavaria at the age of  the young king an ardent admirer of wagners operas had the composer brought to munich the king who was homosexual expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composern  and wagner in his responses had no scruples about counterfeiting a similar atmospheren  ludwig settled wagners considerable debts and proposed to stage tristan die meistersinger the ring and the other operas wagner planned wagner also began to dictate his autobiography mein leben at the kings request wagner noted that his rescue by ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor but later supposed enemy giacomo meyerbeer and regretted that this operatic master who had done me so much harm should not have lived to see this day after grave difficulties in rehearsal tristan und isolde premiered at the national theatre munich on  june  the first wagner opera premiere in almost  years the premiere had been scheduled for  may but was delayed by bailiffs acting for wagners creditors and also because the isolde malvina schnorr von carolsfeld was hoarse and needed time to recover the conductor of this premiere was hans von bülow whose wife cosima had given birth in april that year to a daughter named isolde a child not of bülow but of wagner cosima was  years younger than wagner and was herself illegitimate the daughter of the countess marie dagoult who had left her husband for franz liszt liszt initially disapproved of his daughters involvement with wagner though nevertheless the two men were friends the indiscreet affair scandalised munich and wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court who were suspicious of his influence on the king in december  ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave munich he apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile but wagner quickly dissuaded him richard and cosima wagner photographed in  ludwig installed wagner at the villa tribschen beside switzerlands lake lucerne die meistersinger was completed at tribschen in  and premiered in munich on  june the following year at ludwigs insistence special previews of the first two works of the ring das rheingold and die walküre were performed at munich in  and  but wagner retained his dream first expressed in a communication to my friends to present the first complete cycle at a special festival with a new dedicated opera house minna had died of a heart attack on  january  in dresden wagner did not attend the funeraln  following minnas death cosima wrote to hans von bülow on a number of occasions asking him to grant her a divorce but bülow refused to concede this he only consented after she had two more children with wagner another daughter named eva after the heroine of meistersinger and a son siegfried named for the hero of the ring the divorce was finally sanctioned after delays in the legal process by a berlin court on  july  richard and cosimas wedding took place on  august  on christmas day of that year wagner arranged a surprise performance its premiere of the siegfried idyll for cosimas birthdayn  the marriage to cosima lasted to the end of wagners life wagner settled into his newfound domesticity turned his energies towards completing the ring cycle he had not abandoned polemics he republished his  pamphlet judaism in music originally issued under a pseudonym under his own name in  he extended the introduction and wrote a lengthy additional final section the publication led to several public protests at early performances of die meistersinger in vienna and mannheim bayreuth –edit in  wagner decided to move to bayreuth which was to be the location of his new opera house the town council donated a large plot of land—the green hill—as a site for the theatre the wagners moved to the town the following year and the foundation stone for the bayreuth festspielhaus festival theatre was laid wagner initially announced the first bayreuth festival at which for the first time the ring cycle would be presented complete for  but since ludwig had declined to finance the project the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the festival was deferred to raise funds for the construction wagner societies were formed in several cities and wagner began touring germany conducting concerts by the spring of  only a third of the required funds had been raised further pleas to ludwig were initially ignored but early in  with the project on the verge of collapse the king relented and provided a loan the full building programme included the family home wahnfried into which wagner with cosima and the children moved from their temporary accommodation on  april  the theatre was completed in  and the festival scheduled for the following year commenting on the struggle to finish the building wagner remarked to cosima each stone is red with my blood and yours the bayreuth festspielhaus photochrom print of c  for the design of the festspielhaus wagner appropriated some of the ideas of his former colleague gottfried semper which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at munich wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at bayreuth these include darkening the auditorium during performances and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience the festspielhaus finally opened on  august  with das rheingold at last taking its place as the first evening of the complete ring cycle the  bayreuth festival therefore saw the premiere of the complete cycle performed as a sequence as the composer had intended the  festival consisted of three full ring cycles under the baton of hans richter at the end critical reactions ranged between that of the norwegian composer edvard grieg who thought the work divinely composed and that of the french newspaper le figaro which called the music the dream of a lunatic amongst the disillusioned were wagners friend and disciple friedrich nietzsche who having published his eulogistic essay richard wagner in bayreuth before the festival as part of his untimely meditations was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as wagners pandering to increasingly exclusivist german nationalism his breach with wagner began at this time the festival firmly established wagner as an artist of european and indeed world importance attendees included kaiser wilhelm i the emperor pedro ii of brazil anton bruckner camille saintsaëns and pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky wagner was far from satisfied with the festival cosima recorded that months later his attitude towards the productions was never again never again moreover the festival finished with a deficit of about  marks the expenses of bayreuth and of wahnfried meant that wagner still sought additional sources of income by conducting or taking on commissions such as the centennial march for america for which he received  last years –edit following the first bayreuth festival wagner began work on parsifal his final opera the composition took four years much of which wagner spent in italy for health reasons from  to  wagner also embarked on the last of his documented emotional liaisons this time with judith gautier whom he had met at the  festival wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing parsifal and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than bayreuth he was once again assisted by the liberality of king ludwig but was still forced by his personal financial situation in  to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works including the siegfried idyll to the publisher schott the wagner grave in the wahnfried garden in  cosimas ashes were placed alongside wagners body wagner wrote a number of articles in his later years often on political topics and often reactionary in tone repudiating some of his earlier more liberal views these include religion and art  and heroism and christianity  which were printed in the journal bayreuther blätter published by his supporter hans von wolzogen wagners sudden interest in christianity at this period which infuses parsifal was contemporary with his increasing alignment with german nationalism and required on his part and the part of his associates the rewriting of some recent wagnerian history so as to represent for example the ring as a work reflecting christian ideals many of these later articles including what is german  but based on a draft written in the s repeated wagners antisemitic preoccupations wagner completed parsifal in january  and a second bayreuth festival was held for the new opera which premiered on  may wagner was by this time extremely ill having suffered a series of increasingly severe angina attacks during the sixteenth and final performance of parsifal on  august he entered the pit unseen during act  took the baton from conductor hermann levi and led the performance to its conclusion after the festival the wagner family journeyed to venice for the winter wagner died of a heart attack at the age of  on  february  at ca vendramin calergi a thcentury palazzo on the grand canal the legend that the attack was prompted by argument with cosima over wagners supposedly amorous interest in the singer carrie pringle who had been a flowermaiden in parsifal at bayreuth is without credible evidence after a funerary gondola bore wagners remains

of the hero of wagners opera siegfried wagners operatic works are his primary artistic legacy unlike most opera composers who generally left the task of writing the libretto the text and lyrics to others wagner wrote his own libretti which he referred to as poems from  onwards he urged a new concept of opera often referred to as music drama although he later rejected this termn  in which all musical poetic and dramatic elements were to be fused together—the gesamtkunstwerk wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers the orchestras dramatic role in the later operas includes the use of leitmotifs musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters locales and plot elements their complex interweaving and evolution illuminates the progression of the drama these operas are still despite wagners reservations referred to by many writers as music dramas early works to edit wagners earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on goethes die laune des verliebten the infatuated lovers caprice written at the age of  die hochzeit the wedding on which wagner worked in  and the singspiel männerlist größer als frauenlist men are more cunning than women – die feen the fairies  was unperformed in the composers lifetime and das liebesverbot the ban on love  was withdrawn after its first performance rienzi  was wagners first opera to be successfully staged the compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated rienzi showing the clear influence of grand opera à la spontini and meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark wagners place in musical history later in life wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his oeuvre none of them has ever been performed at the bayreuth festival and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years although the overture to rienzi is an occasional concert piece die feen das liebesverbot and rienzi were performed at both leipzig and bayreuth in  to mark the composers bicentenary romantic operas –edit opening of overture to der fliegende holländer in wagners hand and with his notes to the publisher wagners middle stage output began with der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman  followed by tannhäuser  and lohengrin  these three operas are sometimes referred to as wagners romantic operas they reinforced the reputation among the public in germany and beyond that wagner had begun to establish with rienzi although distancing himself from the style of these operas from  onwards he nevertheless reworked both der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser on several occasionsn  these three operas are considered to represent a significant developmental stage in wagners musical and operatic maturity as regards thematic handling portrayal of emotions and orchestration they are the earliest works included in the bayreuth canon the mature operas that cosima staged at the bayreuth festival after wagners death in accordance with his wishes all three including the differing versions of der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser continue to be regularly performed throughout the world and have been frequently recordedn  they were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetimen  music dramas –edit starting the ringedit main articles der ring des nibelungen der ring des nibelungen composition of the music and der ring des nibelungen composition of the poem brünnhilde the valkyrie as illustrated by arthur rackham  wagners late dramas are considered his masterpieces der ring des nibelungen commonly referred to as the ring or ring cycle is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of germanic mythology—particularly from the later norse mythology—notably the old norse poetic edda and volsunga saga and the middle high german nibelungenlied wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of stabreim highly alliterative rhyming versepairs used in old germanic poetry they were also influenced by wagners concepts of ancient greek drama in which tetralogies were a component of athenian festivals and which he had amply discussed in his essay oper und drama the first two components of the ring cycle were das rheingold the rhinegold which was completed in  and die walküre the valkyrie which was finished in  in das rheingold with its relentlessly talky realism and the absence of lyrical numbers wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his – essays die walküre which contains what is virtually a traditional aria siegmunds winterstürme in the first act and the quasichoral appearance of the valkyries themselves shows more operatic traits but has been assessed by barry millington as the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of oper und drama a thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression tristan und isolde and die meistersingeredit while composing the opera siegfried the third part of the ring cycle wagner interrupted work on it and between  and  wrote the tragic love story tristan und isolde and his only mature comedy die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon franz betz who created the role of hans sachs in die meistersinger and sang wotan in the first complete ring cycle tristan is often granted a special place in musical history many see it as the beginning of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the th century wagner felt that his musicodramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of the art of transition between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines completed in  the work was given its first performance in munich conducted by bülow in june  die meistersinger was originally conceived by wagner in  as a sort of comic pendant to tannhäuser like tristan it was premiered in munich under the baton of bülow on  june  and became an immediate success barry millington describes meistersinger as a rich perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity but because of its strong german nationalist overtones it is also cited by some as an example of wagners reactionary politics and antisemitism completing the ringedit when wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of siegfried and for götterdämmerung twilight of the gods as the final part of the ring his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as operatic than the aural world of rheingold and walküre though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs this was in part because the libretti of the four ring operas had been written in reverse order so that the book for götterdämmerung was conceived more traditionally than that of rheingold still the selfimposed strictures of the gesamtkunstwerk had become relaxed the differences also result from wagners development as a composer during the period in which he wrote tristan meistersinger and the paris version of tannhäuser from act  of siegfried onwards the ring becomes more chromatic melodically more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs wagner took  years from writing the first draft of a libretto in  until he completed götterdämmerung in  the ring takes about  hours to perform and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the worlds stages parsifaledit wagners final opera parsifal  which was his only work written especially for his bayreuth festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a bühnenweihfestspiel festival play for the consecration of the stage has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the holy grail it also carries elements of buddhist renunciation suggested by wagners readings of schopenhauer wagner described it to cosima as his last card it remains controversial because of its treatment of christianity its eroticism and its expression as perceived by some commentators of german nationalism and antisemitism despite the composers own description of the opera to king ludwig as this most christian of works ulrike kienzle has commented that wagners turn to christian mythology upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of parsifal rest is idiosyncratic and contradicts christian dogma in many ways musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composers style and barry millington describes it as a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement nonoperatic musicedit andré gill suggesting that wagners music was earsplitting cover of léclipse  april  apart from his operas wagner composed relatively few pieces of music these include a symphony in c major written at the age of  the faust overture the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject some overtures and choral and piano pieces his most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the siegfried idyll for chamber orchestra which has several motifs in common with the ring cycle the wesendonck lieder are also often performed either in the original piano version or with orchestral accompanimentn  more rarely performed are the american centennial march  and das liebesmahl der apostel the love feast of the apostles a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in  for the city of dresden after completing parsifal wagner expressed his intention to turn to the writing of symphonies and several sketches dating from the late s and early s have been identified as work towards this end the overtures and certain orchestral passages from wagners middle and latestage operas are commonly played as concert pieces for most of these wagner wrote or rewrote short passages to ensure musical coherence the bridal chorus from lohengrin is frequently played as the brides processional wedding march in englishspeaking countries prose writingsedit see also categoryessays by richard

that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims the first such edition was published between  and  but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him eg those praising meyerbeer or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce wagners own account of his progress wagners autobiography mein leben was originally

gustav mahler was devoted to wagner and his music aged  he sought him out on his  visit to vienna became a renowned wagner conductor and his compositions are seen by richard taruskin as extending wagners maximalization of the temporal and the sonorous in music to the world of the symphony the harmonic revolutions of claude debussy and arnold schoenberg both of whose oeuvres contain examples of tonal and atonal modernism have often been traced back to tristan and parsifal the italian form of operatic realism known as verismo owed much to the wagnerian concept of musical form wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting his essay about conducting  advanced hector berliozs technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be reinterpreted rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison he exemplified this approach in his own conducting which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of felix mendelssohn in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon such as the rewriting of scoresn  wilhelm furtwängler felt that wagner and bülow through their interpretative approach inspired a whole new generation of conductors including furtwängler himself amongst those claiming inspiration from wagners music are the german band rammstein and the

nietzsche was a member of wagners inner circle during the early s and his first published work the birth of tragedy proposed wagners music as the dionysian rebirth of european culture in opposition to apollonian rationalist decadence nietzsche broke with wagner following the first bayreuth festival believing that wagners final phase represented a pandering to christian pieties and a surrender to the new german reich nietzsche expressed his displeasure with the later wagner in the case of wagner and nietzsche contra wagner charles baudelaire stéphane mallarmé and paul verlaine worshipped

wagnerian themes inhabit t s eliots the waste land which contains lines from tristan und isolde and götterdämmerung and verlaines poem on parsifal many of wagners concepts including his speculation about dreams predated their investigation by sigmund freud wagner had publicly analysed the oedipus myth before freud was born in terms of its psychological significance insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety georg groddeck considered the ring as the first manual of psychoanalysis influence on cinemaedit wagners concept of the use of leitmotifs and the integrated musical expression which they can enable has influenced many th and st century film scores the critic theodor adorno has noted that the wagnerian leitmotif leads directly to cinema music where the sole function of the leitmotif is to announce heroes or situations so as to allow the audience to orient itself more easily

musical life divided into two factions supporters of wagner and supporters of johannes brahms the latter with the support of the powerful critic eduard hanslick of whom beckmesser in meistersinger is in part a caricature championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against wagnerian innovations they were supported by the conservative leanings of some german music schools including the conservatories at leipzig under ignaz moscheles and at cologne under the direction of ferdinand hiller another wagner detractor was the french composer charlesvalentin alkan who wrote to hiller after attending wagners paris concert on  january  at which wagner conducted the overtures to der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser the preludes to lohengrin and tristan und isolde and six other extracts from tannhäuser and lohengrin i had imagined that i was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of berlioz  i do not like all the music of berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects  but here he was imitated and caricatured  wagner is not a musician he is a disease even those who like debussy opposed wagner this old poisoner could not deny his influence indeed debussy was one of many composers including tchaikovsky who felt the need to break with wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming golliwoggs cakewalk from debussys childrens corner piano suite contains a deliberately tongueincheek quotation from the opening bars of tristan others who proved resistant to wagners operas included gioachino rossini who said wagner has wonderful moments and dreadful quarters of an hour in the th century wagners music was parodied by paul hindemithn  and hanns

controversies wagners operas writings politics beliefs and unorthodox lifestyle made him a controversial figure during his lifetime following his death debate about his ideas and their interpretation particularly in germany during the th century has continued racism and antisemitismedit caricature of wagner by karl clic in the viennese satirical magazine humoristische blätter  the exaggerated features refer to rumours of wagners jewish ancestry wagners writings on jews including jewishness in music corresponded to some existing trends of thought in germany during the th century however despite his very public views on these themes throughout his life wagner had jewish friends colleagues and supporters there have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in wagners operas the characters of mime in the ring sixtus beckmesser in die meistersinger and klingsor in parsifal are sometimes claimed as jewish representations though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operasn  the topic of wagner and the jews is further complicated by allegations which may have been credited by wagner that he himself was of jewish ancestry via his supposed father geyer some biographers have noted that wagner in his final years developed interest in the racialist philosophy of arthur de gobineau notably gobineaus belief that western society was doomed because of miscegenation between superior and inferior races according to robert gutman this theme is reflected in the opera parsifal other biographers such as lucy beckett believe that this is not true as the original drafts of the story date back to  and wagner had completed the libretto for parsifal by  but he displayed no significant interest in gobineau until  other interpretationsedit wagners ideas are amenable to socialist interpretations many of his ideas on art were being formulated at the time of his revolutionary inclinations in the s thus for example george bernard shaw wrote in the perfect wagnerite  wagners picture of niblunghomen  under the reign of alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it was made known in germany in the middle of the th century by engelss book the condition of the working class in england leftwing interpretations of wagner also inform the writings of theodor adorno among other wagner criticsn  walter benjamin gave wagner as an example of bourgeois false consciousness alienating art from its social context the writer robert donington has produced a detailed if controversial jungian interpretation of the ring cycle described as an approach to wagner by way of his symbols which for example sees the character of the goddess fricka as part of her husband wotans inner femininity millington notes that jeanjacques nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of wagners life and works nazi appropriationedit adolf hitler was an admirer of wagners music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the german nation in a  speech he claimed that wagners works glorified the heroic teutonic nature  greatness lies in the heroic hitler visited bayreuth frequently from  onwards and attended the productions at the theatre there continues to be debate about the extent to which wagners views might have influenced nazi thinkingn  houston stewart chamberlain – who married wagners daughter eva in  but never met wagner was the author of the racist book the foundations of the nineteenth century approved by the nazi movement chamberlain met hitler on a number of occasions between  and  in bayreuth but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of wagners own views the nazis used those parts of wagners thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest while bayreuth presented a useful front for nazi culture and wagners music was used at many nazi events the nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share hitlers enthusiasm for wagners operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at hitlers insistence guido fackler has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that wagners music was used at the dachau concentration camp in – to reeducate political prisoners by exposure to national music there has been no evidence to support claims sometimes made that his music was played at nazi death camps during the second world war and pamela potter has noted that wagners music was explicitly offlimits in the campsn  because of the associations of wagner with antisemitism and nazism the performance of his music in the state of israel has been a source of controversy see alsoedit richard wagner – wikipedia book notesedit  of their children two carl gustave and maria theresia died as infants the others were wagners brothers

halfsister caecilie born in  to his mother and her second husband geyer see also wagner family tree  this sketch is referred to alternatively as leubald und adelaide  wagner claimed to have seen schröderdevrient in the title role of fidelio but it seems more likely that he saw her performance as romeo in bellinis i capuleti e i montecchi  röckel and bakunin failed to escape and endured long terms of imprisonment  gutman records him as suffering from constipation and shingles  the influence was noted by nietzsche in his on the genealogy of morality the fascinating position of schopenhauer on art  was apparently the reason richard wagner first moved over to schopenhauer  that shift was so great that it opened up a complete theoretical contrast between his earlier and his later aesthetic beliefs  for example the selfrenouncing cobblerpoet hans sachs in die meistersinger von nürnberg is a schopenhauerian creation schopenhauer asserted that goodness and salvation result from renunciation of the world and turning against and denying ones own will  eg my dearest beloved my beloved my most glorious friend and o holy one i worship you  wagner excused himself in  when discussing this correspondence with cosima by saying the tone wasnt good but i didnt set it  wagner claimed to be unable to travel to the funeral due to an inflamed finger  cosimas birthday was

wagner ˈvɑːɡnər german ˈʁiçaʁt ˈvaːɡnɐ  may  –  february  was a german composer theatre director polemicist and conductor who is primarily known for his operas or as some of his later works were later known music dramas unlike most opera composers wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of weber and meyerbeer wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the gesamtkunstwerk total work of art by which he sought to synthesise the poetic visual musical and dramatic arts with music subsidiary to drama he described this vision in a series of essays published between  and  wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen the ring of the nibelung his compositions particularly those of his later period are notable for their complex textures rich harmonies and orchestration and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters places ideas or plot elements his advances in musical language such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres greatly influenced the development of classical music his tristan und isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music wagner had his own opera house built the bayreuth festspielhaus which embodied many novel design features the ring and parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual bayreuth festival run by his descendants his thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works including die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg until his final years wagners life was characterised by political exile turbulent love affairs poverty and repeated flight from his creditors his controversial writings on music drama and politics have attracted extensive comment notably since the late th century where they express antisemitic sentiments the effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts

family in leipzig where his family lived at no  the brühl the house of the red and white lions in the jewish quarter he was baptized at st thomas church he was the ninth child of carl friedrich wagner who was a clerk in the leipzig police service and his wife johanna rosine née paetz the daughter of a bakern  wagners father carl died of typhus six months after richards birth afterwards his mother johanna lived with carls friend the actor and playwright ludwig geyer in august  johanna and geyer probably married—although no documentation of this has been found in the leipzig church registers she and her family moved to geyers residence in dresden until he was fourteen wagner was known as wilhelm richard geyer he almost certainly thought that geyer was his biological father geyers love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson and wagner took part in his performances in his autobiography mein leben wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel in late  wagner was enrolled at pastor wetzels school at possendorf near dresden where he received some piano instruction from his latin teacher he struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear following geyers death in  richard was sent to the kreuzschule the boarding school of the dresdner kreuzchor at the expense of geyers brother at the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the gothic elements of carl maria von webers opera der freischütz which he saw weber conduct at this period wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright his first creative effort listed in the wagnerwerkverzeichnis the standard listing of wagners works as wwv  was a tragedy called leubald begun when he was in school in  the play was strongly influenced by shakespeare and goethe wagner was determined to set it to music and persuaded his family to allow him music lessonsn  by  the family had returned to leipzig wagners first lessons in harmony were taken during – with christian gottlieb müller in january  he first heard beethovens th symphony and then in march the same composers th symphony both at the gewandhaus beethoven became a major inspiration and wagner wrote a piano transcription of the th symphony he was also greatly impressed by a performance of mozarts requiem wagners early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period in  he saw a performance by dramatic soprano wilhelmine schröderdevrient and she became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera in mein leben wagner wrote when i look back across my entire life i find no event to place beside this in the impression it produced on me and claimed that the profoundly human and ecstatic performance of this incomparable artist kindled in him an almost demonic firen  in  wagner enrolled at the leipzig university where he became a member of the saxon student fraternity he took composition lessons with the thomaskantor theodor weinlig weinlig was so impressed with wagners musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons he arranged for his pupils piano sonata in bflat major which was consequently dedicated to him to be published as wagners op  a year later wagner composed his symphony in c major a beethovenesque work performed in prague in  and at the leipzig gewandhaus in  he then began to work on an opera die hochzeit the wedding which he never completed early career and marriage –edit wilhelmine minna planer  by alexander von otterstedt in  wagners brother albert managed to obtain for him a position as choir master at the theatre in würzburg in the same year at the age of  wagner composed his first complete opera die feen the fairies this work which imitated the style of weber went unproduced until half a century later when it was premiered in munich shortly after the composers death in  having returned to leipzig in  wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in magdeburg during which he wrote das liebesverbot the ban on love based on shakespeares measure for measure this was staged at magdeburg in  but closed before the second performance this together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him left the composer in bankruptcy wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at magdeburg the actress christine wilhelmine minna planer and after the disaster of das liebesverbot he followed her to königsberg where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre the two married in tragheim church on  november  in may  minna left wagner for another man and this was but only the first débâcle of a tempestuous marriage in june  wagner moved to riga then in the russian empire where he became music director of the local opera having in this capacity engaged minnas sister amalie also a singer for the theatre he presently resumed relations with minna during  by  the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled riga on the run from creditors debts would plague wagner for most of his life initially they took a stormy sea passage to london from which wagner drew the inspiration for his opera der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman with a plot based on a sketch by heinrich heine the wagners settled in paris in september  and stayed there until  wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as a pilgrimage to beethoven which sketched his growing concept of music drama and an end in paris where he depicts his own miseries as a german musician in the french metropolis he also provided arrangements of operas by other composers largely on behalf of the schlesinger publishing house during this stay he completed his third and fourth operas rienzi and der fliegende holländer dresden –edit wagner c  by ernest benedikt kietz wagner had completed rienzi in  with the strong support of giacomo meyerbeer it was accepted for performance by the dresden court theatre hofoper in the kingdom of saxony and in  wagner moved to dresden his relief at returning to germany was recorded in his autobiographic sketch of  where he wrote that en route from paris for the first time i saw the rhine—with hot tears in my eyes i poor artist swore eternal fidelity to my german fatherland rienzi was staged to considerable acclaim on  october wagner lived in dresden for the next six years eventually being appointed the royal saxon court conductor during this period he staged there der fliegende holländer  january  and tannhäuser  october  the first two of his three middleperiod operas wagner also mixed with artistic circles in dresden including the composer ferdinand hiller and the architect gottfried semper wagners involvement in leftwing politics abruptly ended his welcome in dresden wagner was active among socialist german nationalists there regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor august röckel and the russian anarchist mikhail bakunin he was also influenced by the ideas of pierrejoseph proudhon and ludwig feuerbach widespread discontent came to a head in  when the unsuccessful may uprising in dresden broke out in which wagner played a minor supporting role warrants were issued for the revolutionaries arrest wagner had to flee first visiting paris and then settling in zürichn  where he at first took refuge with a friend alexander müller in exile switzerland –edit warrant for the arrest of richard wagner issued on  may  wagner was to spend the next twelve years in exile from germany he had completed lohengrin the last of his middleperiod operas before the dresden uprising and now wrote desperately to his friend franz liszt to have it staged in his absence liszt conducted the premiere in weimar in august  nevertheless wagner was in grim personal straits isolated from the german musical world and without any regular income in  julie the wife of his friend karl ritter began to pay him a small pension which she maintained until  with help from her friend jessie laussot this was to have been augmented to an annual sum of  thalers per year but this plan was abandoned when wagner began an affair with mme laussot wagner even planned an elopement with her in  which her husband prevented meanwhile wagners wife minna who had disliked the operas he had written after rienzi was falling into a deepening depression wagner fell victim to illhealth according to ernest newman largely a matter of overwrought nerves which made it difficult for him to continue writingn  wagners primary published output during his first years in zürich was a set of essays in the artwork of the future  he described a vision of opera as gesamtkunstwerk total work of art in which the various arts such as music song dance poetry visual arts and stagecraft were unified judaism in music  was the first of wagners writings to feature antisemitic views in this polemic wagner argued frequently using traditional antisemitic abuse that jews had no connection to the german spirit and were thus capable of producing only shallow and artificial music according to him they composed music to achieve popularity and thereby financial success as opposed to creating genuine works of art in opera and drama  wagner described the aesthetics of drama that he was using to create the ring operas before leaving dresden wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen he initially wrote the libretto for a single opera siegfrieds tod siegfrieds death in  after arriving in zürich he expanded the story with the opera der junge siegfried young siegfried which explored the heros background he completed the text of the cycle by writing the libretti for die walküre the valkyrie and das rheingold the rhine gold and revising the other libretti to agree with his new concept completing them in  the concept of opera expressed in opera and drama and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written up to and including lohengrin partly in an attempt to explain his change of views wagner published in  the autobiographical a communication to my friends this contained his first public announcement of what was to become the ring cycle i shall never write an opera more as i have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works i will call them dramas  i propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas preceded by a lengthy prelude vorspiel  at a speciallyappointed festival i propose some future time to produce those three dramas with their prelude in the course of three days and a foreevening emphasis in original wagner began composing the music for das rheingold between november  and september  following it immediately with die walküre written between june  and march  he began work on the third ring opera which he now called simply siegfried probably in september  but by june  he had completed only the first two acts he decided to put the work aside to concentrate on a new idea tristan und isolde based on the arthurian love story tristan and iseult portrait of mathilde wesendonck  by karl ferdinand sohn one source of inspiration for tristan und isolde was the philosophy of arthur schopenhauer notably his the world as will and representation to which wagner had been introduced in  by his poet friend georg herwegh wagner later called this the most important event of his life his personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be schopenhauers philosophy a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition he remained an adherent of schopenhauer for the rest of his life one of schopenhauers doctrines was that music held a supreme role in the arts as a direct expression of the worlds essence namely blind impulsive will this doctrine contradicted wagners view expressed in opera and drama that the music in opera had to be subservient to the drama wagner scholars have argued that schopenhauers influence caused wagner to assign a more commanding role to music in his later operas including the latter half of the ring cycle which he had yet to composen  aspects of schopenhauerian doctrine found their way into wagners subsequent librettin  a second source of inspiration was wagners infatuation with the poetwriter mathilde wesendonck the wife of the silk merchant otto wesendonck wagner met the wesendoncks who were both great admirers of his music in zürich in  from may  onwards wesendonck made several loans to wagner to finance his household expenses in zürich and in  placed a cottage on his estate at wagners disposal which became known as the asyl asylum or place of rest during this period wagners growing passion for his patrons wife inspired him to put aside work on the ring cycle which was not resumed for the next twelve years and begin work on tristan while planning the opera wagner composed the wesendonck lieder five songs for voice and piano setting poems by mathilde two of these settings are explicitly subtitled by wagner as studies for tristan und isolde amongst the conducting engagements that wagner undertook for revenue during this period he gave several concerts in  with the london philharmonic society including one before queen victoria the queen enjoyed his tannhäuser overture and spoke with wagner after the concert writing of him in her diary that he was short very quiet wears spectacles  has a very finelydeveloped forehead a hooked nose  projecting chin in exile venice and paris –edit wagner in paris  wagners uneasy affair with mathilde collapsed in  when minna intercepted a letter to mathilde from him after the resulting confrontation with minna wagner left zürich alone bound for venice where he rented an apartment in the palazzo giustinian while minna returned to germany wagners attitude to minna had changed the editor of his correspondence with her john burk has said that she was to him an invalid to be treated with kindness and consideration but except at a distance was a menace to his peace of mind wagner continued his correspondence with mathilde and his friendship with her husband otto who maintained his financial support of the composer in an  letter to mathilde wagner wrote halfsatirically of tristan child this tristan is turning into something terrible this final act—i fear the opera will be banned  only mediocre performances can save me perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad in november  wagner once again moved to paris to oversee production of a new revision of tannhäuser staged thanks to the efforts of princess pauline von metternich whose husband was the austrian ambassador in paris the performances of the paris tannhäuser in  were a notable fiasco this was partly a consequence of the conservative tastes of the jockey club which organised demonstrations in the theatre to protest at the presentation of the ballet feature in act  instead of its traditional location in the second act but the opportunity was also exploited by those who wanted to use the occasion as a veiled political protest against the proaustrian policies of napoleon iii it was during this visit that wagner met the french poet charles baudelaire who wrote an appreciative brochure richard wagner et tannhäuser à paris the opera was withdrawn after the third performance and wagner left paris soon after he had sought a reconciliation with minna during this paris visit and although she joined him there the reunion was not successful and they again parted from each other when wagner left return and resurgence –edit the political ban that had been placed on wagner in germany after he had fled dresden was fully lifted in  the composer settled in biebrich on the rhine near wiesbaden in hesse here minna visited him for the last time they parted irrevocably though wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in dresden until her death in  portrait of ludwig ii of bavaria about the time when he first met wagner by ferdinand von piloty  in biebrich wagner at last began work on die meistersinger von nürnberg his only mature comedy wagner wrote a first draft of the libretto in  and he had resolved to develop it during a visit he had made to venice with the wesendoncks in  where he was inspired by titians painting the assumption of the virgin throughout this period – wagner sought to have tristan und isolde produced in vienna despite numerous rehearsals the opera remained unperformed and gained a reputation as being impossible to sing which added to wagners financial problems wagners fortunes took a dramatic upturn in  when king ludwig ii succeeded to the throne of bavaria at the age of  the young king an ardent admirer of wagners operas had the composer brought to munich the king who was homosexual expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composern  and wagner in his responses had no scruples about counterfeiting a similar atmospheren  ludwig settled wagners considerable debts and proposed to stage tristan die meistersinger the ring and the other operas wagner planned wagner also began to dictate his autobiography mein leben at the kings request wagner noted that his rescue by ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor but later supposed enemy giacomo meyerbeer and regretted that this operatic master who had done me so much harm should not have lived to see this day after grave difficulties in rehearsal tristan und isolde premiered at the national theatre munich on  june  the first wagner opera premiere in almost  years the premiere had been scheduled for  may but was delayed by bailiffs acting for wagners creditors and also because the isolde malvina schnorr von carolsfeld was hoarse and needed time to recover the conductor of this premiere was hans von bülow whose wife cosima had given birth in april that year to a daughter named isolde a child not of bülow but of wagner cosima was  years younger than wagner and was herself illegitimate the daughter of the countess marie dagoult who had left her husband for franz liszt liszt initially disapproved of his daughters involvement with wagner though nevertheless the two men were friends the indiscreet affair scandalised munich and wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court who were suspicious of his influence on the king in december  ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave munich he apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile but wagner quickly dissuaded him richard and cosima wagner photographed in  ludwig installed wagner at the villa tribschen beside switzerlands lake lucerne die meistersinger was completed at tribschen in  and premiered in munich on  june the following year at ludwigs insistence special previews of the first two works of the ring das rheingold and die walküre were performed at munich in  and  but wagner retained his dream first expressed in a communication to my friends to present the first complete cycle at a special festival with a new dedicated opera house minna had died of a heart attack on  january  in dresden wagner did not attend the funeraln  following minnas death cosima wrote to hans von bülow on a number of occasions asking him to grant her a divorce but bülow refused to concede this he only consented after she had two more children with wagner another daughter named eva after the heroine of meistersinger and a son siegfried named for the hero of the ring the divorce was finally sanctioned after delays in the legal process by a berlin court on  july  richard and cosimas wedding took place on  august  on christmas day of that year wagner arranged a surprise performance its premiere of the siegfried idyll for cosimas birthdayn  the marriage to cosima lasted to the end of wagners life wagner settled into his newfound domesticity turned his energies towards completing the ring cycle he had not abandoned polemics he republished his  pamphlet judaism in music originally issued under a pseudonym under his own name in  he extended the introduction and wrote a lengthy additional final section the publication led to several public protests at early performances of die meistersinger in vienna and mannheim bayreuth –edit in  wagner decided to move to bayreuth which was to be the location of his new opera house the town council donated a large plot of land—the green hill—as a site for the theatre the wagners moved to the town the following year and the foundation stone for the bayreuth festspielhaus festival theatre was laid wagner initially announced the first bayreuth festival at which for the first time the ring cycle would be presented complete for  but since ludwig had declined to finance the project the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the festival was deferred to raise funds for the construction wagner societies were formed in several cities and wagner began touring germany conducting concerts by the spring of  only a third of the required funds had been raised further pleas to ludwig were initially ignored but early in  with the project on the verge of collapse the king relented and provided a loan the full building programme included the family home wahnfried into which wagner with cosima and the children moved from their temporary accommodation on  april  the theatre was completed in  and the festival scheduled for the following year commenting on the struggle to finish the building wagner remarked to cosima each stone is red with my blood and yours the bayreuth festspielhaus photochrom print of c  for the design of the festspielhaus wagner appropriated some of the ideas of his former colleague gottfried semper which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at munich wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at bayreuth these include darkening the auditorium during performances and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience the festspielhaus finally opened on  august  with das rheingold at last taking its place as the first evening of the complete ring cycle the  bayreuth festival therefore saw the premiere of the complete cycle performed as a sequence as the composer had intended the  festival consisted of three full ring cycles under the baton of hans richter at the end critical reactions ranged between that of the norwegian composer edvard grieg who thought the work divinely composed and that of the french newspaper le figaro which called the music the dream of a lunatic amongst the disillusioned were wagners friend and disciple friedrich nietzsche who having published his eulogistic essay richard wagner in bayreuth before the festival as part of his untimely meditations was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as wagners pandering to increasingly exclusivist german nationalism his breach with wagner began at this time the festival firmly established wagner as an artist of european and indeed world importance attendees included kaiser wilhelm i the emperor pedro ii of brazil anton bruckner camille saintsaëns and pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky wagner was far from satisfied with the festival cosima recorded that months later his attitude towards the productions was never again never again moreover the festival finished with a deficit of about  marks the expenses of bayreuth and of wahnfried meant that wagner still sought additional sources of income by conducting or taking on commissions such as the centennial march for america for which he received  last years –edit following the first bayreuth festival wagner began work on parsifal his final opera the composition took four years much of which wagner spent in italy for health reasons from  to  wagner also embarked on the last of his documented emotional liaisons this time with judith gautier whom he had met at the  festival wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing parsifal and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than bayreuth he was once again assisted by the liberality of king ludwig but was still forced by his personal financial situation in  to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works including the siegfried idyll to the publisher schott the wagner grave in the wahnfried garden in  cosimas ashes were placed alongside wagners body wagner wrote a number of articles in his later years often on political topics and often reactionary in tone repudiating some of his earlier more liberal views these include religion and art  and heroism and christianity  which were printed in the journal bayreuther blätter published by his supporter hans von wolzogen wagners sudden interest in christianity at this period which infuses parsifal was contemporary with his increasing alignment with german nationalism and required on his part and the part of his associates the rewriting of some recent wagnerian history so as to represent for example the ring as a work reflecting christian ideals many of these later articles including what is german  but based on a draft written in the s repeated wagners antisemitic preoccupations wagner completed parsifal in january  and a second bayreuth festival was held for the new opera which premiered on  may wagner was by this time extremely ill having suffered a series of increasingly severe angina attacks during the sixteenth and final performance of parsifal on  august he entered the pit unseen during act  took the baton from conductor hermann levi and led the performance to its conclusion after the festival the wagner family journeyed to venice for the winter wagner died of a heart attack at the age of  on  february  at ca vendramin calergi a thcentury palazzo on the grand canal the legend that the attack was prompted by argument with cosima over wagners supposedly amorous interest in the singer carrie pringle who had been a flowermaiden in parsifal at bayreuth is without credible evidence after a funerary gondola bore wagners remains

of the hero of wagners opera siegfried wagners operatic works are his primary artistic legacy unlike most opera composers who generally left the task of writing the libretto the text and lyrics to others wagner wrote his own libretti which he referred to as poems from  onwards he urged a new concept of opera often referred to as music drama although he later rejected this termn  in which all musical poetic and dramatic elements were to be fused together—the gesamtkunstwerk wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers the orchestras dramatic role in the later operas includes the use of leitmotifs musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters locales and plot elements their complex interweaving and evolution illuminates the progression of the drama these operas are still despite wagners reservations referred to by many writers as music dramas early works to edit wagners earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on goethes die laune des verliebten the infatuated lovers caprice written at the age of  die hochzeit the wedding on which wagner worked in  and the singspiel männerlist größer als frauenlist men are more cunning than women – die feen the fairies  was unperformed in the composers lifetime and das liebesverbot the ban on love  was withdrawn after its first performance rienzi  was wagners first opera to be successfully staged the compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated rienzi showing the clear influence of grand opera à la spontini and meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark wagners place in musical history later in life wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his oeuvre none of them has ever been performed at the bayreuth festival and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years although the overture to rienzi is an occasional concert piece die feen das liebesverbot and rienzi were performed at both leipzig and bayreuth in  to mark the composers bicentenary romantic operas –edit opening of overture to der fliegende holländer in wagners hand and with his notes to the publisher wagners middle stage output began with der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman  followed by tannhäuser  and lohengrin  these three operas are sometimes referred to as wagners romantic operas they reinforced the reputation among the public in germany and beyond that wagner had begun to establish with rienzi although distancing himself from the style of these operas from  onwards he nevertheless reworked both der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser on several occasionsn  these three operas are considered to represent a significant developmental stage in wagners musical and operatic maturity as regards thematic handling portrayal of emotions and orchestration they are the earliest works included in the bayreuth canon the mature operas that cosima staged at the bayreuth festival after wagners death in accordance with his wishes all three including the differing versions of der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser continue to be regularly performed throughout the world and have been frequently recordedn  they were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetimen  music dramas –edit starting the ringedit main articles der ring des nibelungen der ring des nibelungen composition of the music and der ring des nibelungen composition of the poem brünnhilde the valkyrie as illustrated by arthur rackham  wagners late dramas are considered his masterpieces der ring des nibelungen commonly referred to as the ring or ring cycle is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of germanic mythology—particularly from the later norse mythology—notably the old norse poetic edda and volsunga saga and the middle high german nibelungenlied wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of stabreim highly alliterative rhyming versepairs used in old germanic poetry they were also influenced by wagners concepts of ancient greek drama in which tetralogies were a component of athenian festivals and which he had amply discussed in his essay oper und drama the first two components of the ring cycle were das rheingold the rhinegold which was completed in  and die walküre the valkyrie which was finished in  in das rheingold with its relentlessly talky realism and the absence of lyrical numbers wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his – essays die walküre which contains what is virtually a traditional aria siegmunds winterstürme in the first act and the quasichoral appearance of the valkyries themselves shows more operatic traits but has been assessed by barry millington as the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of oper und drama a thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression tristan und isolde and die meistersingeredit while composing the opera siegfried the third part of the ring cycle wagner interrupted work on it and between  and  wrote the tragic love story tristan und isolde and his only mature comedy die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon franz betz who created the role of hans sachs in die meistersinger and sang wotan in the first complete ring cycle tristan is often granted a special place in musical history many see it as the beginning of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the th century wagner felt that his musicodramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of the art of transition between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines completed in  the work was given its first performance in munich conducted by bülow in june  die meistersinger was originally conceived by wagner in  as a sort of comic pendant to tannhäuser like tristan it was premiered in munich under the baton of bülow on  june  and became an immediate success barry millington describes meistersinger as a rich perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity but because of its strong german nationalist overtones it is also cited by some as an example of wagners reactionary politics and antisemitism completing the ringedit when wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of siegfried and for götterdämmerung twilight of the gods as the final part of the ring his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as operatic than the aural world of rheingold and walküre though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs this was in part because the libretti of the four ring operas had been written in reverse order so that the book for götterdämmerung was conceived more traditionally than that of rheingold still the selfimposed strictures of the gesamtkunstwerk had become relaxed the differences also result from wagners development as a composer during the period in which he wrote tristan meistersinger and the paris version of tannhäuser from act  of siegfried onwards the ring becomes more chromatic melodically more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs wagner took  years from writing the first draft of a libretto in  until he completed götterdämmerung in  the ring takes about  hours to perform and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the worlds stages parsifaledit wagners final opera parsifal  which was his only work written especially for his bayreuth festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a bühnenweihfestspiel festival play for the consecration of the stage has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the holy grail it also carries elements of buddhist renunciation suggested by wagners readings of schopenhauer wagner described it to cosima as his last card it remains controversial because of its treatment of christianity its eroticism and its expression as perceived by some commentators of german nationalism and antisemitism despite the composers own description of the opera to king ludwig as this most christian of works ulrike kienzle has commented that wagners turn to christian mythology upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of parsifal rest is idiosyncratic and contradicts christian dogma in many ways musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composers style and barry millington describes it as a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement nonoperatic musicedit andré gill suggesting that wagners music was earsplitting cover of léclipse  april  apart from his operas wagner composed relatively few pieces of music these include a symphony in c major written at the age of

accompanimentn  more rarely performed are the american centennial march  and das liebesmahl der apostel the love feast of the apostles a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in  for the city of dresden after completing parsifal wagner expressed his intention to turn to the writing of symphonies and several sketches dating from the late s and early s have been identified as work towards this end the overtures and certain orchestral passages from wagners middle and latestage operas are commonly played as concert pieces for most of these wagner wrote or rewrote short passages to ensure

wagners maximalization of the temporal and the sonorous in music to the world of the symphony the harmonic revolutions of claude debussy and arnold schoenberg both of whose oeuvres contain examples of tonal and atonal modernism have often been traced back to tristan and parsifal the italian form of operatic realism known as verismo owed much to the wagnerian concept of musical form wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting his essay about conducting  advanced hector berliozs technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be reinterpreted rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison he exemplified this approach in his own conducting which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of felix mendelssohn in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon such as the rewriting of scoresn  wilhelm furtwängler felt that wagner and bülow through their

the conservatories at leipzig under ignaz moscheles and at cologne under the direction of ferdinand hiller another wagner detractor was the french composer charlesvalentin alkan who wrote to hiller

the score for the film as wagners music still in copyright was not available amongst other film portrayals of wagner are alan badel in magic fire  lyndon brook in song without end  trevor howard in ludwig  paul nicholas in lisztomania  and richard burton in wagner  jonathan harveys opera wagner dream  intertwines the events surrounding wagners death with the story of wagners uncompleted opera outline die sieger the victors bayreuth festivaledit main article bayreuth festival since wagners death the bayreuth festival which has become an annual event has been successively directed by his widow his son siegfried the latters widow winifred wagner their two sons wieland and wolfgang wagner and presently two of the composers greatgranddaughters eva wagnerpasquier and katharina wagner since  the festival has been overseen by the richardwagnerstiftung richard wagner foundation the members of which include a number of wagners descendants controversiesedit main article wagner controversies wagners operas writings politics beliefs and unorthodox lifestyle made him a controversial figure during his lifetime following his death debate about his ideas and their interpretation particularly in germany during the th century has continued racism and antisemitismedit caricature of wagner by karl clic in the viennese satirical magazine humoristische blätter  the exaggerated features refer to rumours of wagners jewish ancestry wagners writings on jews including jewishness in music corresponded to some existing trends of thought in germany during the th century however despite his very public views on these themes throughout his life wagner had jewish friends colleagues and supporters there have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in wagners operas the characters of mime in the ring sixtus beckmesser in die meistersinger and klingsor in parsifal are sometimes claimed as jewish representations though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operasn  the topic of wagner and the jews is further complicated by allegations which may have been credited by wagner that he himself was of jewish ancestry via his supposed father geyer some biographers have noted that wagner in his final years developed interest in the racialist philosophy of arthur de gobineau notably gobineaus belief that western society was doomed because of miscegenation between superior and inferior races according to robert gutman this theme is reflected in the opera parsifal other biographers such as lucy beckett believe that this is not true as the original drafts of the story date back to  and wagner had completed the libretto for parsifal by  but he displayed no significant interest in gobineau until  other interpretationsedit wagners ideas are amenable to socialist interpretations many of his ideas on art were being formulated at the time of his revolutionary inclinations in the s thus for example george bernard shaw wrote in the perfect wagnerite  wagners picture of niblunghomen  under the reign of alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it was made known in germany in the middle of the th century by engelss book the condition of the working class in england leftwing interpretations of wagner also inform the writings of theodor adorno among other wagner criticsn  walter benjamin gave wagner as an example of bourgeois false consciousness alienating art from its social context the writer robert donington has produced a detailed if controversial jungian interpretation of the ring cycle described as an approach to wagner by way of his symbols which for example sees the character of the goddess fricka as part of her husband wotans inner femininity millington notes that jeanjacques nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of wagners life and works nazi appropriationedit adolf hitler was an admirer of wagners music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the german nation in a  speech he claimed that wagners works glorified the heroic teutonic nature  greatness lies in the heroic hitler visited bayreuth frequently from  onwards and attended the productions at the theatre there continues to be debate about the extent to which wagners views might have influenced nazi thinkingn  houston stewart chamberlain – who married wagners daughter eva in  but never met wagner was the author of the racist book the foundations of the nineteenth century approved by the nazi movement chamberlain met hitler on a number of occasions between  and  in bayreuth but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of wagners own views the nazis used those parts of wagners thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest while bayreuth presented a useful front for nazi culture and wagners music was used at many nazi events the nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share hitlers enthusiasm for wagners operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at hitlers insistence guido fackler has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that wagners music was used at the dachau concentration camp in – to reeducate political prisoners by exposure to national music there has been no evidence to support claims sometimes made that his music was played at nazi death camps during the second world war and pamela potter has noted that wagners music was explicitly offlimits in the campsn  because of the associations of wagner with antisemitism and nazism the performance of his music in the state of israel has been a source of controversy see alsoedit richard wagner – wikipedia book notesedit  of their children two carl gustave and maria theresia died as infants the others were wagners brothers albert and carl julius and his sisters rosalie luise clara and ottilie except for carl julius becoming a goldsmith all his siblings developed careers connected with the stage wagner also had a younger halfsister caecilie born in  to his mother and her second husband geyer see also wagner family tree  this sketch is referred to alternatively as leubald und adelaide  wagner claimed to have seen schröderdevrient in the title role of fidelio but it seems more likely that he saw her performance as romeo in bellinis i capuleti e i montecchi  röckel and bakunin failed to escape and endured long terms of imprisonment  gutman records him as suffering from constipation and shingles  the influence was noted by nietzsche in his on the genealogy of morality the fascinating position of schopenhauer on art  was apparently the reason richard wagner first moved over to schopenhauer  that shift was so great that it opened up a complete theoretical contrast between his earlier and his later aesthetic beliefs  for example the selfrenouncing cobblerpoet hans sachs in die meistersinger von nürnberg is a schopenhauerian creation schopenhauer asserted that goodness and salvation result from renunciation of the world and turning against and denying ones own will  eg my dearest beloved my beloved my most glorious friend and o holy one i worship you  wagner excused himself in  when discussing this correspondence with cosima by saying the tone wasnt good but i didnt set it  wagner claimed to be unable to travel to the funeral due to an inflamed finger  cosimas birthday was  december but she usually celebrated it on christmas day  in his  essay on the designation music drama he criticises the term music drama suggesting instead the phrase deeds of music made visible  for the reworking of der fliegende holländer see deathridge    for that of tannhäuser see millington  – which further cites wagners comment to cosima three weeks before his death that he still owes the world tannhäuser see also the articles on these operas in wikipedia  see performance listings by opera in operabase and the wikipedia articles the flying dutchman discography tannhäuser discography and lohengrin discography  for example der fliegende holländer dutchman was first performed in london in  and in the us philadelphia in  tannhäuser in new york in  and in london in  lohengrin in new york in  and london in  for detailed performance histories including other countries see stanford university wagner site under each opera  normally the orchestration by felix mottl is used score available at imslp website although wagner arranged one of the songs for chamber orchestra  see for example wagners proposals for the rescoring of beethovens ninth symphony in his essay on that work  see overture to the flying dutchman as sightread by a bad spa orchestra at  in the morning by the well  weiner  gives very detailed allegations of antisemitism in wagners music and characterisations  shaws anglicization of nibelheim the empire of alberich in the ring cycle  see žižek  viii in this book for the first time the marxist reading of a musical work of art  was combined with the highest musicological analysis  the claim that hitler in his maturity commented that it ie his political career all began after seeing a performance of rienzi in his youth has been disproved  see eg john  for a detailed essay on music in the nazi death camps which nowhere mentions wagner see also potter   we know from testimonies that concentration camp orchestras played all sorts of music  but that wagner was explicitly offlimits however after the war unsubstantiated claims that wagners music accompanied jews to their death took on momentum referencesedit citationsedit

known music dramas unlike most opera composers wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of weber and meyerbeer wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the gesamtkunstwerk total work of art by which he sought to synthesise the poetic visual musical and dramatic arts with music subsidiary to drama he described this vision in a series of essays published between  and  wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen the ring of the nibelung his compositions particularly those of his later period are notable for their complex textures rich harmonies and orchestration and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters places ideas or plot elements his advances in musical language such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres greatly influenced the development of classical music his tristan und isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music wagner had his own opera house built the bayreuth festspielhaus which embodied many novel design features the ring and parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual bayreuth festival run by his descendants his thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works including die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg until his final years wagners life was characterised by political exile turbulent love affairs poverty and repeated flight from his creditors his controversial writings on music drama and politics have attracted extensive comment notably since the late th century where they express antisemitic sentiments the effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts

family in leipzig where his family lived at no  the brühl the house of the red and white lions in the jewish quarter he was baptized at st thomas church he was the ninth child of carl friedrich wagner who was a clerk in the leipzig police service and his wife johanna rosine née paetz the daughter of a bakern  wagners father carl died of typhus six months after richards birth afterwards his mother johanna lived with carls friend the actor and playwright ludwig geyer in august  johanna and geyer probably married—although no documentation of this has been found in the leipzig church registers she and her family moved to geyers residence in dresden until he was fourteen wagner was known as wilhelm richard geyer he almost certainly thought that geyer was his biological father geyers love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson and wagner took part in his performances in his autobiography mein leben wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel in late  wagner was enrolled at pastor wetzels school at possendorf near dresden where he received some piano instruction from his latin teacher he struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear following geyers death in  richard was sent to the kreuzschule the boarding school of the dresdner kreuzchor at the expense of geyers brother at the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the gothic elements of carl maria von webers opera der freischütz which he saw weber conduct at this period wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright his first creative effort listed in the wagnerwerkverzeichnis the standard listing of wagners works as wwv  was a tragedy called leubald begun when he was in school in  the play was strongly influenced by shakespeare and goethe wagner was determined to set it to music and persuaded his family to allow him music lessonsn  by  the family had returned to leipzig wagners first lessons in harmony were taken during – with christian gottlieb müller in january  he first heard beethovens th symphony and then in march the same composers th symphony both at the gewandhaus beethoven became a major inspiration and wagner wrote a piano transcription of the th symphony he was also greatly impressed by a performance of mozarts requiem wagners early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period in  he saw a performance by dramatic soprano wilhelmine schröderdevrient and she became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera in mein leben wagner wrote when i look back across my entire life i find no event to place beside this in the impression it produced on me and claimed that the profoundly human and ecstatic performance of this incomparable artist kindled in him an almost demonic firen  in  wagner enrolled at the leipzig university where he became a member of the saxon student fraternity he took composition lessons with the thomaskantor theodor weinlig weinlig was so impressed with wagners musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons he arranged for his pupils piano sonata in bflat major which was consequently dedicated to him to be published as wagners op  a year later wagner composed his symphony in c major a beethovenesque work performed in prague in  and at the leipzig gewandhaus in  he then began to work on an opera die hochzeit the wedding which he never completed early career and marriage –edit wilhelmine minna planer  by alexander von otterstedt in  wagners brother albert managed to obtain for him a position as choir master at the theatre in würzburg in the same year at the age of  wagner composed his first complete opera die feen the fairies this work which imitated the style of weber went unproduced until half a century later when it was premiered in munich shortly after the composers death in  having returned to leipzig in  wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in magdeburg during which he wrote das liebesverbot the ban on love based on shakespeares measure for measure this was staged at magdeburg in  but closed before the second performance this together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him left the composer in bankruptcy wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at magdeburg the actress christine wilhelmine minna planer and after the disaster of das liebesverbot he followed her to königsberg where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre the two married in tragheim church on  november  in may  minna left wagner for another man and this was but only the first débâcle of a tempestuous marriage in june  wagner moved to riga then in the russian empire where he became music director of the local opera having in this capacity engaged minnas sister amalie also a singer for the theatre he presently resumed relations with minna during  by  the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled riga on the run from creditors debts would plague wagner for most of his life initially they took a stormy sea passage to london from which wagner drew the inspiration for his opera der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman with a plot based on a sketch by heinrich heine the wagners settled in paris in september  and stayed there until  wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as a pilgrimage to beethoven which sketched his growing concept of music drama and an end in paris where he depicts his own miseries as a german musician in the french metropolis he also provided arrangements of operas by other composers largely on behalf of the schlesinger publishing house during this stay he completed his third and fourth operas rienzi and der fliegende holländer dresden –edit wagner c  by ernest benedikt kietz wagner had completed rienzi in  with the strong support of giacomo meyerbeer it was accepted for performance by the dresden court theatre hofoper in the kingdom of saxony and in  wagner moved to dresden his relief at returning to germany was recorded in his autobiographic sketch of  where he wrote that en route from paris for the first time i saw the rhine—with hot tears in my eyes i poor artist swore eternal fidelity to my german fatherland rienzi was staged to considerable acclaim on  october wagner lived in dresden for the next six years eventually being appointed the royal saxon court conductor during this period he staged there der fliegende holländer  january  and tannhäuser  october  the first two of his three middleperiod operas wagner also mixed with artistic circles in dresden including the composer ferdinand hiller and the architect gottfried semper wagners involvement in leftwing politics abruptly ended his welcome in dresden wagner was active among socialist german nationalists there regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor august röckel and the russian anarchist mikhail bakunin he was also influenced by the ideas of pierrejoseph proudhon and ludwig feuerbach widespread discontent came to a head in  when the unsuccessful may uprising in dresden broke out in which wagner played a minor supporting role warrants were issued for the revolutionaries arrest wagner had to flee first visiting paris and then settling in zürichn  where he at first took refuge with a friend alexander müller in exile switzerland –edit warrant for the arrest of richard wagner issued on  may  wagner was to spend the next twelve years in exile from germany he had completed lohengrin the last of his middleperiod operas before the dresden uprising and now wrote desperately to his friend franz liszt to have it staged in his absence liszt conducted the premiere in weimar in august  nevertheless wagner was in grim personal straits isolated from the german musical world and without any regular income in  julie the wife of his friend karl ritter began to pay him a small pension which she maintained until  with help from her friend jessie laussot this was to have been augmented to an annual sum of  thalers per year but this plan was abandoned when wagner began an affair with mme laussot wagner even planned an elopement with her in  which her husband prevented meanwhile wagners wife minna who had disliked the operas he had written after rienzi was falling into a deepening depression wagner fell victim to illhealth according to ernest newman largely a matter of overwrought nerves which made it difficult for him to continue writingn  wagners primary published output during his first years in zürich was a set of essays in the artwork of the future  he described a vision of opera as gesamtkunstwerk total work of art in which the various arts such as music song dance poetry visual arts and stagecraft were unified judaism in music  was the first of wagners writings to feature antisemitic views in this polemic wagner argued frequently using traditional antisemitic abuse that jews had no connection to the german spirit and were thus capable of producing only shallow and artificial music according to him they composed music to achieve popularity and thereby financial success as opposed to creating genuine works of art in opera and drama  wagner described the aesthetics of drama that he was using to create the ring operas before leaving dresden wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the fouropera cycle der ring des nibelungen he initially wrote the libretto for a single opera siegfrieds tod siegfrieds death in  after arriving in zürich he expanded the story with the opera der junge siegfried young siegfried which explored the heros background he completed the text of the cycle by writing the libretti for die walküre the valkyrie and das rheingold the rhine gold and revising the other libretti to agree with his new concept completing them in  the concept of opera expressed in opera and drama and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written up to and including lohengrin partly in an attempt to explain his change of views wagner published in  the autobiographical a communication to my friends this contained his first public announcement of what was to become the ring cycle i shall never write an opera more as i have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works i will call them dramas  i propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas preceded by a lengthy prelude vorspiel  at a speciallyappointed festival i propose some future time to produce those three dramas with their prelude in the course of three days and a foreevening emphasis in original wagner began composing the music for das rheingold between november  and september  following it immediately with die walküre written between june  and march  he began work on the third ring opera which he now called simply siegfried probably in september  but by june  he had completed only the first two acts he decided to put the work aside to concentrate on a new idea tristan und isolde based on the arthurian love story tristan and iseult portrait of mathilde wesendonck  by karl ferdinand sohn one source of inspiration for tristan und isolde was the philosophy of arthur schopenhauer notably his the world as will and representation to which wagner had been introduced in  by his poet friend georg herwegh wagner later called this the most important event of his life his personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be schopenhauers philosophy a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition he remained an adherent of schopenhauer for the rest of his life one of schopenhauers doctrines was that music held a supreme role in the arts as a direct expression of the worlds essence namely blind impulsive will this doctrine contradicted wagners view expressed in opera and drama that the music in opera had to be subservient to the drama wagner scholars have argued that schopenhauers influence caused wagner to assign a more commanding role to music in his later operas including the latter half of the ring cycle which he had yet to composen  aspects of schopenhauerian doctrine found their way into wagners subsequent librettin  a second source of inspiration was wagners infatuation with the poetwriter mathilde wesendonck the wife of the silk merchant otto wesendonck wagner met the wesendoncks who were both great admirers of his music in zürich in  from may  onwards wesendonck made several loans to wagner to finance his household expenses in zürich and in  placed a cottage on his estate at wagners disposal which became known as the asyl asylum or place of rest during this period wagners growing passion for his patrons wife inspired him to put aside work on the ring cycle which was not resumed for the next twelve years and begin work on tristan while planning the opera wagner composed the wesendonck lieder five songs for voice and piano setting poems by mathilde two of these settings are explicitly subtitled by wagner as studies for tristan und isolde amongst the conducting engagements that wagner undertook for revenue during this period he gave several concerts in  with the london philharmonic society including one before queen victoria the queen enjoyed his tannhäuser overture and spoke with wagner after the concert writing of him in her diary that he was short very quiet wears spectacles  has a very finelydeveloped forehead a hooked nose  projecting chin in exile venice and paris –edit wagner in paris  wagners uneasy affair with mathilde collapsed in  when minna intercepted a letter to mathilde from him after the resulting confrontation with minna wagner left zürich alone bound for venice where he rented an apartment in the palazzo giustinian while minna returned to germany wagners attitude to minna had changed the editor of his correspondence with her john burk has said that she was to him an invalid to be treated with kindness and consideration but except at a distance was a menace to his peace of mind wagner continued his correspondence with mathilde and his friendship with her husband otto who maintained his financial support of the composer in an  letter to mathilde wagner wrote halfsatirically of tristan child this tristan is turning into something terrible this final act—i fear the opera will be banned  only mediocre performances can save me perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad in november  wagner once again moved to paris to oversee production of a new revision of tannhäuser staged thanks to the efforts of princess pauline von metternich whose husband was the austrian ambassador in paris the performances of the paris tannhäuser in  were a notable fiasco this was partly a consequence of the conservative tastes of the jockey club which organised demonstrations in the theatre to protest at the presentation of the ballet feature in act  instead of its traditional location in the second act but the opportunity was also exploited by those who wanted to use the occasion as a veiled political protest against the proaustrian policies of napoleon iii it was during this visit that wagner met the french poet charles baudelaire who wrote an appreciative brochure richard wagner et tannhäuser à paris the opera was withdrawn after the third performance and wagner left paris soon after he had sought a reconciliation with minna during this paris visit and although she joined him there the reunion was not successful and they again parted from each other when wagner left return and resurgence –edit the political ban that had been placed on wagner in germany after he had fled dresden was fully lifted in  the composer settled in biebrich on the rhine near wiesbaden in hesse here minna visited him for the last time they parted irrevocably though wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in dresden until her death in  portrait of ludwig ii of bavaria about the time when he first met wagner by ferdinand von piloty  in biebrich wagner at last began work on die meistersinger von nürnberg his only mature comedy wagner wrote a first draft of the libretto in  and he had resolved to develop it during a visit he had made to venice with the wesendoncks in  where he was inspired by titians painting the assumption of the virgin throughout this period – wagner sought to have tristan und isolde produced in vienna despite numerous rehearsals the opera remained unperformed and gained a reputation as being impossible to sing which added to wagners financial problems wagners fortunes took a dramatic upturn in  when king ludwig ii succeeded to the throne of bavaria at the age of  the young king an ardent admirer of wagners operas had the composer brought to munich the king who was homosexual expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composern  and wagner in his responses had no scruples about counterfeiting a similar atmospheren  ludwig settled wagners considerable debts and proposed to stage tristan die meistersinger the ring and the other operas wagner planned wagner also began to dictate his autobiography mein leben at the kings request wagner noted that his rescue by ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor but later supposed enemy giacomo meyerbeer and regretted that this operatic master who had done me so much harm should not have lived to see this day after grave difficulties in rehearsal tristan und isolde premiered at the national theatre munich on  june  the first wagner opera premiere in almost  years the premiere had been scheduled for  may but was delayed by bailiffs acting for wagners creditors and also because the isolde malvina schnorr von carolsfeld was hoarse and needed time to recover the conductor of this premiere was hans von bülow whose wife cosima had given birth in april that year to a daughter named isolde a child not of bülow but of wagner cosima was  years younger than wagner and was herself illegitimate the daughter of the countess marie dagoult who had left her husband for franz liszt liszt initially disapproved of his daughters involvement with wagner though nevertheless the two men were friends the indiscreet affair scandalised munich and wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court who were suspicious of his influence on the king in december  ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave munich he apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile but wagner quickly dissuaded him richard and cosima wagner photographed in  ludwig installed wagner at the villa tribschen beside switzerlands lake lucerne die meistersinger was completed at tribschen in  and premiered in munich on  june the following year at ludwigs insistence special previews of the first two works of the ring das rheingold and die walküre were performed at munich in  and  but wagner retained his dream first expressed in a communication to my friends to present the first complete cycle at a special festival with a new dedicated opera house minna had died of a heart attack on  january  in dresden wagner did not attend the funeraln  following minnas death cosima wrote to hans von bülow on a number of occasions asking him to grant her a divorce but bülow refused to concede this he only consented after she had two more children with wagner another daughter named eva after the heroine of meistersinger and a son siegfried named for the hero of the ring the divorce was finally sanctioned after delays in the legal process by a berlin court on  july  richard and cosimas wedding took place on  august  on christmas day of that year wagner arranged a surprise performance its premiere of the siegfried idyll for cosimas birthdayn  the marriage to cosima lasted to the end of wagners life wagner settled into his newfound domesticity turned his energies towards completing the ring cycle he had not abandoned polemics he republished his  pamphlet judaism in music originally issued under a pseudonym under his own name in  he extended the introduction and wrote a lengthy additional final section the publication led to several public protests at early performances of die meistersinger in vienna and mannheim bayreuth –edit in  wagner decided to move to bayreuth which was to be the location of his new opera house the town council donated a large plot of land—the green hill—as a site for the theatre the wagners moved to the town the following year and the foundation stone for the bayreuth festspielhaus festival theatre was laid wagner initially announced the first bayreuth festival at which for the first time the ring cycle would be presented complete for  but since ludwig had declined to finance the project the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the festival was deferred to raise funds for the construction wagner societies were formed in several cities and wagner began touring germany conducting concerts by the spring of  only a third of the required funds had been raised further pleas to ludwig were initially ignored but early in  with the project on the verge of collapse the king relented and provided a loan the full building programme included the family home wahnfried into which wagner with cosima and the children moved from their temporary accommodation on  april  the theatre was completed in  and the festival scheduled for the following year commenting on the struggle to finish the building wagner remarked to cosima each stone is red with my blood and yours the bayreuth festspielhaus photochrom print of c  for the design of the festspielhaus wagner appropriated some of the ideas of his former colleague gottfried semper which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at munich wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at bayreuth these include darkening the auditorium during performances and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience the festspielhaus finally opened on  august  with das rheingold at last taking its place as the first evening of the complete ring cycle the  bayreuth festival therefore saw the premiere of the complete cycle performed as a sequence as the composer had intended the  festival consisted of three full ring cycles under the baton of hans richter at the end critical reactions ranged between that of the norwegian composer edvard grieg who thought the work divinely composed and that of the french newspaper le figaro which called the music the dream of a lunatic amongst the disillusioned were wagners friend and disciple friedrich nietzsche who having published his eulogistic essay richard wagner in bayreuth before the festival as part of his untimely meditations was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as wagners pandering to increasingly exclusivist german nationalism his breach with wagner began at this time the festival firmly established wagner as an artist of european and indeed world importance attendees included kaiser wilhelm i the emperor pedro ii of brazil anton bruckner camille saintsaëns and pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky wagner was far from satisfied with the festival cosima recorded that months later his attitude towards the productions was never again never again moreover the festival finished with a deficit of about  marks the expenses of bayreuth and of wahnfried meant that wagner still sought additional sources of income by conducting or taking on commissions such as the centennial march for america for which he received  last years –edit following the first bayreuth festival wagner began work on parsifal his final opera the composition took four years much of which wagner spent in italy for health reasons from  to  wagner also embarked on the last of his documented emotional liaisons this time with judith gautier whom he had met at the  festival wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing parsifal and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than bayreuth he was once again assisted by the liberality of king ludwig but was still forced by his personal financial situation in  to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works including the siegfried idyll to the publisher schott the wagner grave in the wahnfried garden in  cosimas ashes were placed alongside wagners body wagner wrote a number of articles in his later years often on political topics and often reactionary in tone repudiating some of his earlier more liberal views these include religion and art  and heroism and christianity  which were printed in the journal bayreuther blätter published by his supporter hans von wolzogen wagners sudden interest in christianity at this period which infuses parsifal was contemporary with his increasing alignment with german nationalism and required on his part and the part of his associates the rewriting of some recent wagnerian history so as to represent for example the ring as a work reflecting christian ideals many of these later articles including what is german  but based on a draft written in the s repeated wagners antisemitic preoccupations wagner completed parsifal in january  and a second bayreuth festival was held for the new opera which premiered on  may wagner was by this time extremely ill having suffered a series of increasingly severe angina attacks during the sixteenth and final performance of parsifal on  august he entered the pit unseen during act  took the baton from conductor hermann levi and led the performance to its conclusion after the festival the wagner family journeyed to venice for the winter wagner died of a heart attack at the age of  on  february  at ca vendramin calergi a thcentury palazzo on the grand canal the legend that the attack was prompted by argument with cosima over wagners supposedly amorous interest in the singer carrie pringle who had been a flowermaiden in parsifal at bayreuth is without credible evidence after a funerary gondola bore wagners remains over the grand canal his body was taken to germany where it was buried in the garden of the villa wahnfried in bayreuth worksedit see also list of works for the stage by wagner and list of compositions by richard wagner wagners musical output is listed by the wagnerwerkverzeichnis wwv as comprising  works including fragments and projects operasedit leitmotif associated with the horncall of the hero of wagners opera siegfried wagners operatic works are his primary artistic legacy unlike most opera composers who generally left the task of writing the libretto the text and lyrics to others wagner wrote his own libretti which he referred to as poems from  onwards he urged a new concept of opera often referred to as music drama although he later rejected this termn  in which all musical poetic and dramatic elements were to be fused together—the gesamtkunstwerk wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers the orchestras dramatic role in the later operas includes the use of leitmotifs musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters locales and plot elements their complex interweaving and evolution illuminates the progression of the drama these operas are still despite wagners reservations referred to by many writers as music dramas early works to edit wagners earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on goethes die laune des verliebten the infatuated lovers caprice written at the age of  die hochzeit the wedding on which wagner worked in  and the singspiel männerlist größer als frauenlist men are more cunning than women – die feen the fairies  was unperformed in the composers lifetime and das liebesverbot the ban on love  was withdrawn after its first performance rienzi  was wagners first opera to be successfully staged the compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated rienzi showing the clear influence of grand opera à la spontini and meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark wagners place in musical history later in life wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his oeuvre none of them has ever been performed at the bayreuth festival and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years although the overture to rienzi is an occasional concert piece die feen das liebesverbot and rienzi were performed at both leipzig and bayreuth in  to mark the composers bicentenary romantic operas –edit opening of overture to der fliegende holländer in wagners hand and with his notes to the publisher wagners middle stage output began with der fliegende holländer the flying dutchman  followed by tannhäuser  and lohengrin  these three operas are sometimes referred to as wagners romantic operas they reinforced the reputation among the public in germany and beyond that wagner had begun to establish with rienzi although distancing himself from the style of these operas from  onwards he nevertheless reworked both der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser on several occasionsn  these three operas are considered to represent a significant developmental stage in wagners musical and operatic maturity as regards thematic handling portrayal of emotions and orchestration they are the earliest works included in the bayreuth canon the mature operas that cosima staged at the bayreuth festival after wagners death in accordance with his wishes all three including the differing versions of der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser continue to be regularly performed throughout the world and have been frequently recordedn  they were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetimen  music dramas –edit starting the ringedit main articles der ring des nibelungen der ring des nibelungen composition of the music and der ring des nibelungen composition of the poem brünnhilde the valkyrie as illustrated by arthur rackham  wagners late dramas are considered his masterpieces der ring des nibelungen commonly referred to as the ring or ring cycle is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of germanic mythology—particularly from the later norse mythology—notably the old norse poetic edda and volsunga saga and the middle high german nibelungenlied wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of stabreim highly alliterative rhyming versepairs used in old germanic poetry they were also influenced by wagners concepts of ancient greek drama in which tetralogies were a component of athenian festivals and which he had amply discussed in his essay oper und drama the first two components of the ring cycle were das rheingold the rhinegold which was completed in  and die walküre the valkyrie which was finished in  in das rheingold with its relentlessly talky realism and the absence of lyrical numbers wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his – essays die walküre which contains what is virtually a traditional aria siegmunds winterstürme in the first act and the quasichoral appearance of the valkyries themselves shows more operatic traits but has been assessed by barry millington as the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of oper und drama a thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression tristan und isolde and die meistersingeredit while composing the opera siegfried the third part of the ring cycle wagner interrupted work on it and between  and  wrote the tragic love story tristan und isolde and his only mature comedy die meistersinger von nürnberg the mastersingers of nuremberg two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon franz betz who created the role of hans sachs in die meistersinger and sang wotan in the first complete ring cycle tristan is often granted a special place in musical history many see it as the beginning of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the th century wagner felt that his musicodramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of the art of transition between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines completed in  the work was given its first performance in munich conducted by bülow in june  die meistersinger was originally conceived by wagner in  as a sort of comic pendant to tannhäuser like tristan it was premiered in munich under the baton of bülow on  june  and became an immediate success barry millington describes meistersinger as a rich perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity but because of its strong german nationalist overtones it is also cited by some as an example of wagners reactionary politics and antisemitism completing the ringedit when wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of siegfried and for götterdämmerung twilight of the gods as the final part of the ring his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as operatic than the aural world of rheingold and walküre though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs this was in part because the libretti of the four ring operas had been written in reverse order so that the book for götterdämmerung was conceived more traditionally than that of rheingold still the selfimposed strictures of the gesamtkunstwerk had become relaxed the differences also result from wagners development as a composer during the period in which he wrote tristan meistersinger and the paris version of tannhäuser from act  of siegfried onwards the ring becomes more chromatic melodically more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs wagner took  years from writing the first draft of a libretto in  until he completed götterdämmerung in  the ring takes about  hours to perform and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the worlds stages parsifaledit wagners final opera parsifal  which was his only work written especially for his bayreuth festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a bühnenweihfestspiel festival play for the consecration of the stage has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the holy grail it also carries elements of buddhist renunciation suggested by wagners readings of schopenhauer wagner described it to cosima as his last card it remains controversial because of its treatment of christianity its eroticism and its expression as perceived by some commentators of german nationalism and antisemitism despite the composers own description of the opera to king ludwig as this most christian of works ulrike kienzle has commented that wagners turn to christian mythology upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of parsifal rest is idiosyncratic and contradicts christian dogma in many ways musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composers style and barry millington describes it as a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement nonoperatic musicedit andré gill suggesting that wagners music was earsplitting cover of léclipse  april  apart from his operas wagner composed relatively few pieces of music these include a symphony in c major written at the age of  the faust overture the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject some overtures and choral and piano pieces his most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the siegfried idyll for chamber orchestra which has several motifs in common with the ring cycle the wesendonck lieder are also often performed either in the original piano version or with orchestral accompanimentn  more rarely performed are the american centennial march  and das liebesmahl der apostel the love feast of the apostles a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in  for the city of dresden after completing parsifal wagner expressed his intention to turn to the writing of symphonies and several sketches dating from the late s and early s have been identified as work towards this end the overtures and certain orchestral passages from wagners middle and latestage operas are commonly played as concert pieces for most of these wagner wrote or rewrote short passages to ensure musical coherence the bridal chorus from lohengrin is frequently played as the brides processional wedding march in englishspeaking countries prose writingsedit see also categoryessays by richard wagner and categoryautobiographical works by richard wagner wagner was an extremely prolific writer authoring numerous books poems and articles as well as voluminous correspondence his writings covered a wide range of topics including autobiography politics philosophy and detailed analyses of his own operas wagner planned for a collected edition of his publications as early as  he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims the first such edition was published between  and  but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him eg those praising meyerbeer or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce wagners own account of his progress wagners autobiography mein leben was originally published for close friends only in a very small edition – copies per volume in four volumes between  and  the first public edition with many passages suppressed by cosima appeared in  the first attempt at a full edition in german appeared in  there have been modern complete or partial editions of wagners writings including a centennial edition in german edited by dieter borchmeyer which however omitted the essay das judenthum in der musik and mein leben the english translations of wagners prose in eight volumes by w ashton ellis – are still in print and commonly used despite their deficiencies a complete edition of wagners correspondence estimated to amount to between  and  items is still under way under the supervision of the institute for music research at the university of würzburg as of november   volumes have appeared covering the period to  influence and legacyedit influence on musicedit the opening of tristan und isolde featuring the tristan chord problems playing this file see media help wagners later musical style introduced new ideas in harmony melodic process leitmotif and operatic structure notably from tristan und isolde onwards he explored the limits of the traditional tonal system which gave keys and chords their identity pointing the way to atonality in the th century some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of tristan which include the socalled tristan chord gustav mahler wagner inspired great devotion for a long period many composers were inclined to align themselves with or against wagners music anton bruckner and hugo wolf were greatly indebted to him as were césar franck henri duparc ernest chausson jules massenet richard strauss alexander von zemlinsky hans pfitzner and numerous others gustav mahler was devoted to wagner and his music aged  he sought him out on his  visit to vienna became a renowned wagner conductor and his compositions are seen by richard taruskin as extending wagners maximalization of the temporal and the sonorous in music to the world of the symphony the harmonic revolutions of claude debussy and arnold schoenberg both of whose oeuvres contain examples of tonal and atonal modernism have often been traced back to tristan and parsifal the italian form of operatic realism known as verismo owed much to the wagnerian concept of musical form wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting his essay about conducting  advanced hector berliozs technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be reinterpreted rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison he exemplified this approach in his own conducting which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of felix mendelssohn in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon such as the rewriting of scoresn  wilhelm furtwängler felt that wagner and bülow through their interpretative approach inspired a whole new generation of conductors including furtwängler himself amongst those claiming inspiration from wagners music are the german band rammstein and the electronic composer klaus schulze whose  album timewind consists of two minute tracks bayreuth return and wahnfried  joey demaio of the band manowar has described wagner as the father of heavy metal the slovenian group laibach created the  suite volkswagner using material from wagners operas phil spectors wall of sound recording technique was it has been claimed heavily influenced by wagner influence on literature philosophy and the visual artsedit friedrich nietzsche wagners influence on literature and philosophy is significant millington has commented wagners protean abundance meant that he could inspire the use of literary motif in many a novel employing interior monologue  the symbolists saw him as a mystic hierophant the decadents found many a frisson in his work friedrich nietzsche was a member of wagners inner circle during the early s and his first published work the birth of tragedy proposed wagners music as the dionysian rebirth of european culture in opposition to apollonian rationalist decadence nietzsche broke with wagner following the first bayreuth festival believing that wagners final phase represented a pandering to christian pieties and a surrender to the new german reich nietzsche expressed his displeasure with the later wagner in the case of wagner and nietzsche contra wagner charles baudelaire stéphane mallarmé and paul verlaine worshipped wagner édouard dujardin whose influential novel les lauriers sont coupés is in the form of an interior monologue inspired by wagnerian music founded a journal dedicated to wagner la revue wagnérienne to which j k huysmans and téodor de wyzewa contributed in a list of major cultural figures influenced by wagner bryan magee includes d h lawrence aubrey beardsley romain rolland gérard de nerval pierreauguste renoir rainer maria rilke and numerous others unveiling of the richard wagner monument in the tiergarten  by anton von werner in the th century w h auden once called wagner perhaps the greatest genius that ever lived while thomas mann and marcel proust were heavily influenced by him and discussed wagner in their novels he is also discussed in some of the works of james joyce wagnerian themes inhabit t s eliots the waste land which contains lines from tristan und isolde and götterdämmerung and verlaines poem on parsifal many of wagners concepts including his speculation about dreams predated their investigation by sigmund freud wagner had publicly analysed the oedipus myth before freud was born in terms of its psychological significance insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety georg groddeck considered the ring as the first manual of psychoanalysis influence on cinemaedit wagners concept of the use of leitmotifs and the integrated musical expression which they can enable has influenced many th and st century film scores the critic theodor adorno has noted that the wagnerian leitmotif leads directly to cinema music where the sole function of the leitmotif is to announce heroes or situations so as to allow the audience to orient itself more easily amongst film scores citing wagnerian themes are francis ford coppolas apocalypse now which features a version of the ride of the valkyries trevor joness soundtrack to john boormans film excalibur and the  films a dangerous method dir david cronenberg and melancholia dir lars von trier hansjürgen syberbergs  film hitler a film from germanys visual style and set design are strongly inspired by der ring des nibelungen musical excerpts from which are frequently used in the films soundtrack opponents and supportersedit eduard hanslick not all reaction to wagner was positive for a time german musical life divided into two factions supporters of wagner and supporters of johannes brahms the latter with the support of the powerful critic eduard hanslick of whom beckmesser in meistersinger is in part a caricature championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against wagnerian innovations they were supported by the conservative leanings of some german music schools including the conservatories at leipzig under ignaz moscheles and at cologne under the direction of ferdinand hiller another wagner detractor was the french composer charlesvalentin alkan who wrote to hiller after attending wagners paris concert on  january  at which wagner conducted the overtures to der fliegende holländer and tannhäuser the preludes to lohengrin and tristan und isolde and six other extracts from tannhäuser and lohengrin i had imagined that i was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of berlioz  i do not like all the music of berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects  but here he was imitated and caricatured  wagner is not a musician he is a disease even those who like debussy opposed wagner this old poisoner could not deny his influence indeed debussy was one of many composers including tchaikovsky who felt the need to break with wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming golliwoggs cakewalk from debussys childrens corner piano suite contains a deliberately tongueincheek quotation from the opening bars of tristan others who proved resistant to wagners operas included gioachino rossini who said wagner has wonderful moments and dreadful quarters of an hour in the th century wagners music was parodied by paul hindemithn  and hanns eisler among others wagners followers known as wagnerians or wagnerites have formed many societies dedicated to wagners life and work film and stage portrayalsedit main article list of films about richard wagner wagner has been the subject of many biographical films the earliest was a silent film made by carl froelich in  and featured in the title role the composer giuseppe becce who also wrote the score for the film as wagners music still in copyright was not available amongst other film portrayals of wagner are alan badel in magic fire  lyndon brook in song without end  trevor howard in ludwig  paul nicholas in lisztomania  and richard burton in wagner  jonathan harveys opera wagner dream  intertwines the events surrounding wagners death with the story of wagners uncompleted opera outline die sieger the victors bayreuth festivaledit main article bayreuth festival since wagners death the bayreuth festival which has become an annual event has been successively directed by his widow his son siegfried the latters widow winifred wagner their two sons wieland and wolfgang wagner and presently two of the composers greatgranddaughters eva wagnerpasquier and katharina wagner since  the festival has been overseen by the richardwagnerstiftung richard wagner foundation the members of which include a number of wagners descendants controversiesedit main article wagner controversies wagners operas writings politics beliefs and unorthodox lifestyle made him a controversial figure during his lifetime following his death debate about his ideas and their interpretation particularly in germany during the th century has continued racism and antisemitismedit caricature of wagner by karl clic in the viennese satirical magazine humoristische blätter  the exaggerated features refer to rumours of wagners jewish ancestry wagners writings on jews including jewishness in music corresponded to some existing trends of thought in germany during the th century however despite his very public views on these themes throughout his life wagner had jewish friends colleagues and supporters there have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in wagners operas the characters of mime in the ring sixtus beckmesser in die meistersinger and klingsor in parsifal are sometimes claimed as jewish representations though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operasn  the topic of wagner and the jews is further complicated by allegations which may have been credited by wagner that he himself was of jewish ancestry via his supposed father geyer some biographers have noted that wagner in his final years developed interest in the racialist philosophy of arthur de gobineau notably gobineaus belief that western society was doomed because of miscegenation between superior and inferior races according to robert gutman this theme is reflected in the opera parsifal other biographers such as lucy beckett believe that this is not true as the original drafts of the story date back to  and wagner had completed the libretto for parsifal by  but he displayed no significant interest in gobineau until  other interpretationsedit wagners ideas are amenable to socialist interpretations many of his ideas on art were being formulated at the time of his revolutionary inclinations in the s thus for example george bernard shaw wrote in the perfect wagnerite  wagners picture of niblunghomen  under the reign of alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it was made known in germany in the middle of the th century by engelss book the condition of the working class in england leftwing interpretations of wagner also inform the writings of theodor adorno among other wagner criticsn  walter benjamin gave wagner as an example of bourgeois false consciousness alienating art from its social context the writer robert donington has produced a detailed if controversial jungian interpretation of the ring cycle described as an approach to wagner by way of his symbols which for example sees the character of the goddess fricka as part of her husband wotans inner femininity millington notes that jeanjacques nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of wagners life and works nazi appropriationedit adolf hitler was an admirer of wagners music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the german nation in a  speech he claimed that wagners works glorified the heroic teutonic nature  greatness lies in the heroic hitler visited bayreuth frequently from  onwards and attended the productions at the theatre there continues to be debate about the extent to which wagners views might have influenced nazi thinkingn  houston stewart chamberlain – who married wagners daughter eva in  but never met wagner was the author of the racist book the foundations of the nineteenth century approved by the nazi movement chamberlain met hitler on a number of occasions between  and  in bayreuth but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of wagners own views the nazis used those parts of wagners thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest while bayreuth presented a useful front for nazi culture and wagners music was used at many nazi events the nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share hitlers enthusiasm for wagners operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at hitlers insistence guido fackler has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that wagners music was used at the dachau concentration camp in – to reeducate political prisoners by exposure to national music there has been no evidence to support claims sometimes made that his music was played at nazi death camps during the second world war and pamela potter has noted that wagners music was explicitly offlimits in the campsn  because of the associations of wagner with antisemitism and nazism the performance of his music in the state of israel has been a source of controversy see alsoedit richard wagner – wikipedia book notesedit  of their children two carl gustave and maria theresia died as infants the others were wagners brothers albert and carl julius and his sisters rosalie luise clara and ottilie except for carl julius becoming a goldsmith all his siblings developed careers connected with the stage wagner also had a younger halfsister caecilie born in  to his mother and her second husband geyer see also wagner family tree  this sketch is referred to alternatively as leubald und adelaide  wagner claimed to have seen schröderdevrient in the title role of fidelio but it seems more likely that he saw her performance as romeo in bellinis i capuleti e i montecchi  röckel and bakunin failed to escape and endured long terms of imprisonment  gutman records him as suffering from constipation and shingles  the influence was noted by nietzsche in his on the genealogy of morality the fascinating position of schopenhauer on art  was apparently the reason richard wagner first moved over to schopenhauer  that shift was so great that it opened up a complete theoretical contrast between his earlier and his later aesthetic beliefs  for example the selfrenouncing cobblerpoet hans sachs in die meistersinger von nürnberg is a schopenhauerian creation schopenhauer asserted that goodness and salvation result from renunciation of the world and turning against and denying ones own will  eg my dearest beloved my beloved my most glorious friend and o holy one i worship you  wagner excused himself in  when discussing this correspondence with cosima by saying the tone wasnt good but i didnt set it  wagner claimed to be unable to travel to the funeral due to an inflamed finger  cosimas birthday was  december but she usually celebrated it on christmas day  in his  essay on the designation music drama he criticises the term music drama suggesting instead the phrase deeds of music made visible  for the reworking of der fliegende holländer see deathridge    for that of tannhäuser see millington  – which further cites wagners comment to cosima three weeks before his death that he still owes the world tannhäuser see also the articles on these operas in wikipedia  see performance listings by opera in operabase and the wikipedia articles the flying dutchman discography tannhäuser discography

a detailed essay on music in the nazi death camps which nowhere mentions wagner see also potter   we know from testimonies that concentration camp orchestras played all sorts of music  but that wagner

orchestra piano reduction add to cart  € description details wagner richard das liebesmahl der apostel the feast of pentecost for male chorusses  orchestra piano reduction preface to the full score das liebesmahl der apostel biblical scene for multiple male choruses and orchestra to words by the composer  hardly had wagner escaped the deprivations of his paris years and landed safely in dresden than he “goodnaturedly” accepted in january  the post of conductor of the dresden liedertafel a male choral society which as he amusingly sums up in mein leben “consisted of a moderately large number of young merchants and civil servants who took greater pleasure in any form of convivial entertainment than in music” this appointment a strange footnote to the career of a composer who otherwise felt completely out of place outside the theater was probably an attempt to ingratiate himself with dresden‘s “solid burghers” after having spent years living on the margins of society in paris whatever his reasons for accepting it he soon found himself embroiled in a project that turned out to be unique not only in his own oeuvre but in the annals of nineteenthcentury music the liedertafel was headed by a redoubtable “professor löwe” whose first name has strangely eluded discovery to the present day but whose headlong ambitions and organizing zeal earned him from wagner the nickname of “robespierre” and the principal character trait of “terrorism” faced with the upcoming second general festival of male choruses in july professor löwe conceived the idea of presenting a new work of twentyfive minutes’ duration to be performed by the assembled male choruses of the whole of saxony the task of writing this mammoth work fell to wagner who blanched at thought of twentyfive uninterrupted minutes of a cappella male voices and realized that he would have to breathe much drama into the piece to rescue it from monotony interrupting his work on tannhäuser he selected the remarkable biblical story of pentecost from acts ii in which the apostles are visited by the holy ghost and suddenly become able to “speak in tongues” on this basis he quickly drafted a verse libretto which between april and  june  he set for three choruses of youths ttbb the twelve apostles  basses a chorus of “voices from on high”  tenors  first basses and  second basses and a huge orchestra with quadruple woodwind a large brass section including serpent massive strings four kettledrums and two harps the gigantic new work entitled das liebesmahl der apostel “the lovefeast of the apostles” was punctually premièred a week later on  july  in dresden’s famous frauenkirche the  male choristers occupied almost the whole of the nave the onehundredman orchestra much of the rest and the “chorus from on high” sang from the lofty heights of the cupola to bring about the requisite dramatic impact wagner had the orchestra remain silent for the first twentyfive minutes of the piece leaving the field entirely to the male choruses which he divided up into groups of widely unequal sizes to ensure variety of sound two harps accompanied softly in the background to make sure that they remained in tune not until the appearance of the holy ghost at the words “welch brausen erfüllt die luft” what roaring doth fill the air did the orchestra enter to electrifying effect the performance was hugely successful and might in a different composer have predestined its author to become a postmendelssohnian creator of oratorios wagner however drew a different conclusion “i was surprised by the disproportionately slight impact that reached my ear from this immeasurable tangle of human bodies” and resolved never again to attempt such mass musical happenings shortly thereafter he found a diplomatic way to “disburden himself” of the liedertafel by arranging for his equally ambitious friend ferdinand hiller to become his successor in later years wagner spoke disparagingly of this remarkable work which fits hardly any of the generic categories of its day and which he called privately to cosima “a sort of ammergau passion play” yet das liebesmahl der apostel was promptly published in full score and vocal score by breitkopf  härtel in leipzig  and quickly entered the repertoire of germany’s male choral societies where it remained firmly implanted until the turn of the century breitkopf felt called upon to reissue the work in full score and vocal score in  again in  and with english and french translations in  the english firm of novello in london also issued vocal scores in  and  all of which points to a surprisingly large market in both germany and abroad for this ungainly work to the great critic and historian hermann kretzschmar writing in  das liebesmahl der apostel was “a firm and radiant pillar of its genre” and the entrance of the orchestra an “elemental effect which remains emblazoned in memory to the end of one’s days” wagner took a less sanguine view of the affair referring to it unfairly as a pièce d’occasion yet anyone who knows and appreciates the monks in tannhäuser the sailors in tristan or in another superior “liebesmahl” the knights of the grail in parsifal will find much of interest in this score and the dramatic postponement of the orchestra and the multiple unequal choruses make the work unique in its century on  june  wagner played through das liebesmahl at the piano for the benefit of his wife cosima prefacing his performance with the words “don’t expect too much of it” at the end however he added perhaps only halfironically “there one can fully recognize the composer of tristan und isolde” plot synopsis “the disciples of the lord have secretly gathered together in jerusalem to commemorate their deceased savior in a joint feast some chorus ii are filled with fear and trepidation others chorus iii speak words of encouragement a third group chorus i unisono makes ready and orders the celebration to begin when all are fully prepared the apostles enter but with a message of horror new persecutions have been decreed and the teachings of the man from nazareth are proscribed on pain of death despair seizes the disciples in direst need they beseech the almighty to help them ‘send us thy holy ghost’ a miracle occurs from the heavenly heights a chorus of angels is heard invisible ‘be comforted’ at these wondrous words of solace they again take heart the celebration of the lovefeast is joyously enacted and ends with a rousing vow from all the disciples to go forth and proclaim the word of the lord to all the nations” translated from h kretzschmar führer durch den concertsaal ii oratorien und weltliche chorwerke leipzig  pp  bradford robinson  for performance material please contact the
