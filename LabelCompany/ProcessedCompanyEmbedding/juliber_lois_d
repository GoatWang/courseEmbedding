solve safety issues by peter whoriskey and frank ahrens washington post staff writerswednesday february   toyotas top us executive told lawmakers on tuesday that he is not certain the company has fixed its runaway car problems even though it has recalled millions of vehicles around the world although the automaker has blamed obstructing floor mats and sticky gas pedals for reports of cars accelerating out of control lawmakers at a hearing on capitol hill appeared skeptical about the sometimesconflicting accounts of what has gone wrong do you believe that the recall on the carpet changes and the recalls on the sticky pedals will solve the problem of sudden unintended acceleration rep henry a waxman dcalif asked james e lentz iii president of toyota motor sales usa not totally lentz replied what do you need to do waxman asked we need to continue to be vigilant and continue to investigate all of the complaints that we get from consumers  that we have done a relatively poor job of doing in the past lentz said the hearing before the house energy and commerce committee was jammed with spectators and news media from the united states and japan who heard emotional testimony about terrifying car rides as well as engineering analysis and a lengthy corporate apology lentz at one point fought back tears recalling that he lost his brother in a car crash years ago theres not a day that goes by that i dont think of that he said so i know what these families go through in the end the hearing outlined but did not resolve the controversy that has rocked the worlds largest automaker in recent weeks what exactly has caused toyota cars in rare but occasionally fatal instances to rev and accelerate out of control at another hearing wednesday toyota president akio toyoda plans to face the house oversight and government reform committee and attribute the companys troubles to rapid growth i regret that this has resulted in the safety issues described in the recalls we face today and i am deeply sorry for any accidents that toyota drivers have experienced he said in prepared remarks released ahead of the event on tuesday lawmakers first heard testimony from a retired tennessee social worker whose toyota  lexus es  sped up to  miles per hour during a wild sixmile ride in  the car sped on even after the driver applied the emergency brake and shifted into neutral and then reversei prayed for god to help me rhonda smith testified tearfully i called my husband on the bluetooth phone system i knew he could not help me but i wanted to hear his voice one more time for months afterward the couple tried telling their story to journalists to toyota and to federal safety regulators they said they wanted to warn others of what they viewed as a deadly flaw they also wanted their money back on a car that had only  miles on it one knoxville television station watetv ran a story toyota looked at the engine but said it seemed fine an investigator from the national highway traffic safety administration visited the couple in tennessee but he seemed to arrive with the preconceived idea to sell to us that it was a floor mat problem smith testified she was sure it was not it wasnt until the death of a california highway patrol officer and his family in august which was preceded by their fraught  call seconds before the crash that the company and federal regulators seemed to give more credence to consumer complaints shame on you toyota for being so greedy smith said and shame on you nhtsa for not doing your job lentz who testified later reacted to her story listening to mrs smith im embarrassed for what happened he said you didnt have to have a death to understand the terror she had from that accident the tennessee couple was followed by david gilbert of southern illinois university a professor who said his interest was piqued after seeing news reports about the runaway toyotas based on  years teaching and testing automotive technology gilbert said he conducted an experiment that showed a toyota avalons onboard computer could be tricked into operating as if nothing was wrong even if the accelerator was stuck and the car was speeding uncontrollably to be quite honest at the moment i discovered this i was sick at my stomach he said gilberts research was attacked by rep steve buyer rind who has a toyota assembly plant in his district he asked gilbert whether he had cut three wires in the car to rig his test gilbert responded that he had not he tapped into the wires with a monitor for electric current a procedure within scientific methods rep diana degette dcolo told gilbert that toyota lawyers said they were able to duplicate gilberts experiment but that it amounted to sabotage she asked gilbert whether the conditions simulated in his experiment could occur while driving yes gilbert responded then why wasnt toyota able to find this earlier maybe they werent asking the right questions gilbert said some lawmakers suggested that gilberts research was meant only to make money gilbert said hed been paid  so far by safety consultant sean kane who works on behalf of victims families and trial attorneys that gilbert could so quickly turn up a problem that an entire industry has been looking for seemed too good to be true lentz said its not in our interest if a problem exists to not find it lentz reminded lawmakers the other key question facing lawmakers is why the nhtsa did not act earlier in response to consumer complaints in lateafternoon testimony transportation secretary ray lahood told lawmakers you have my  percent commitment we will get in the weeds on this rep jane harman dcalif who owns between  and  in toyota stock with her husband recused herself from participating in tuesdays

the national traffic safety agency on tuesday enlarge this image toru hanaireuters akio toyoda left of toyota met with japans transportation minister seiji maehara on tuesday about the recalls executives at toyota “were dragging things out and we’d had it” a senior american transportation official said in recounting new details of the talks “we were getting excuses that didn’t make sense anymore”mr lahood approved the unprecedented trip but it would be a month before his top safety aides met with toyota executives and another month before toyota disclosed to washington that it had found problems with some sticking accelerators not once in more than six years of reviews of toyota’s problems did officials at the national highway traffic safety administration which regulates automakers use their power to subpoena toyota’s records even though they said they believed the automaker was withholding critical information now with the recalls of some eight million toyota vehicles since late last year including more than  models of the  prius and other hybrid models this week the traffic safety agency promises to be scrutinized as much as toyota itself members of congress independent experts on auto experts and others say they want to know why the agency did not act more aggressively in investigating toyota’s problems“this is the most extensive vehicle recall in history and we want to know what did toyota know about its defects and when did they know it and what did nhtsa know and did it act quickly enough” representative henry a waxman the california democrat who leads the house energy and commerce committee said on tuesday some congressional officials and outside experts say they believe the safety agency has become too close to the industry it is charged with regulating as a number of agency employees have gone to work for toyota among other issues that need to be addressed they also cite the agency’s limited use of fines or subpoenas against auto manufacturers a dearth of technical expertise in areas like electronic throttle problems and frequent turnover in its leadership joan claybrook who was the director of the agency in the carter administration said that it “should be the government cop on the auto regulatory beat” but too often it was not “it has enormous authority to do its job” she said “but it doesn’t always have the staff or money and in this particular case they took the road of least resistance”mr waxman’s committee has sought documents from the safety agency and scheduled a hearing this month on the problems a second group the house oversight and government reform committee postponed a hearing until feb  in recent days toyota has begun taking out fullpage newspaper advertisements to repair its reputation and has brought on new lobbyists to make its case in washington where many lawmakers have benefited from the campaign contributions and jobs at home provided by the company and transportation officials have begun pushing back as well “the national highway traffic safety administration has the most active defect investigation program in the world” mr lahood said on tuesday in a statement to the new york times “its safety experts are dedicated to finding and fixing safety problems and they review  consumer complaints every year over just the last three years nhtsa’s investigations have resulted in  recalls involving  million vehicles — a stellar record”but internal agency documents and interviews with auto safety experts demonstrate that the safety agency and the auto giant it regulated engaged in a kabuki dance of sorts in the months and years before tensions coalesced drivers would file complaints by the dozens about mysterious accelerations and other hazards federal regulators would open official reviews toyota would promise answers the regulators would complain about not receiving the information they needed and in the end almost nothing would come of any of it six times since  in fact the safety agency opened inquiries into possible toyota safety problems and six times it closed them without any significant actionin  for instance the agency examined a request from the owner of a toyota tacoma pickup to investigate “sudden and uncontrolled acceleration” after a preliminary review the safety agency concluded in a memorandum given to house investigators that “in view of the need to allocate and prioritize nhtsa’s limited resources to best accomplish the agency’s safety mission the petition is denied” in recent years the agency has dealt with financing and staff cuts in some areas the transportation department announced last week that the administration was seeking money for  new positionsthe agency also has had a revolving door of leaders with about a halfdozen directors since  the current administrator david strickland was confirmed only in december the agency was stymied by toyota’s centralized decisionmaking but did not act aggressively in its dealings with the company’s leaders over its six defect investigations agency investigators never met with japanese executives only toyota officials in the united states christopher santucci a manager of safety affairs for toyota in washington testified in a deposition in a lawsuit that all decisions on defects and vehicle recalls were made in japan federal regulators were routinely told during investigations that requests for safety data or vehicle testing must be relayed to japan for answers by the fall of last year nhtsa officials had become frustrated by delays in receiving information even though the agency was not getting all the information it wanted from japan it did receive data about possible defects from state farm the insurance firm beginning in  the agency said that information was incorporated into its continuing investigations but congressional officials say it should have set off louder warnings at the agency congressional investigators have indicated that they are looking into the agency’s ability to investigate possible defects in toyota’s computerized electronic throttlecontrol systems the agency is expected to hire outside experts to assist in its inquiry said a federal official with knowledge of the decisionbut the transportation department said the move was not a sign of any shortcomings in its level of inhouse expertise since  the agency has conducted  investigations into throttle controls both mechanical and electronic versions the department said the toyota recalls occurred a decade after nhtsa withstood heavy criticism from congress over its failure to detect a pattern of rollovers in ford suv’s with firestone tires in that case state farm had given the agency documents warning of safety failures but congressional investigators said the agency was slow to realize the significance “this is history repeating itself” said clarence ditlow who runs the center for auto safety and is scheduled to appear as a witness at the house oversight hearing “where were they before this” he asked of the safety agency “the whole relationship is really too cozy they view their constituency as the auto industry and not the consumer it’s a classic case of a regulatory agency that over time becomes captured by the industry it regulates” ： hanching chung      星期 戴圈  戴圈，  mail 大「此會知誰健，」感慨，　看看吧！ httpyifertwblogspotcomhtml

begun a prius recall tokyo — toyota says it is recalling about  prius and other hybrid vehicles worldwide to fix brake problems – the latest in a string of embarrassing safety lapses at the worlds largest automaker i apologize for causing trouble and worries for many customers over the quality and safety of toyota president akio toyoda said at a press conference tuesday in tokyo we sincerely acknowledge safety concerns from our customers he said we have decided to recall as we regard safety for our customers as our foremost priority the recall is the latest blow to toyota motor corp which is in the midst of recalling more than  million vehicles worldwide because of problems with floor mats which can trap gas pedals and faulty gas pedals that are slow to return to the idle position the  prius wasnt part of those recalls there have been about  complaints in japan and the us about a delay when the brakes in the prius were pressed in cold conditions and on some bumpy roads the delay doesnt indicate a brake failure the company says the problem can be fixed in  minutes with new software that oversees the controls of the antilock brakes toyota officials went to japans transport ministry earlier tuesday to formally notify officials the company is recalling the  prius gaselectric hybrid – the worlds topselling hybrid car the automaker is also recalling two other hybrid models in japan the lexus hsh sedan sold in the us and japan and the sai which is sold only in japan the  cars being recalled in japan include nearly  priuses sold from april last year through monday according to papers the automaker filed with the ministry the prius is japans topselling car in the us toyota will recall  prius cars and  lexus hsh vehicles nearly  priuses are also being recalled in europe owners in japan of the  prius can get their cars fixed starting wednesday said ryusuke itazaki chief of the recall department at the transport ministryhe said toyota would suspend production of the sai and lexus hsh in japan as the company doesnt have the updated software for those models yet if drivers experience any delayed reaction when depressing the brakes in any of these models they should keep pressing he said itazaki said complaints about the brakes started coming in as the weather got colder particularly from northern japan he also said toyota should have taken action sooner if the company had paid more attention to consumers viewpoint it could have realized that there was a safety problem toyoda the president has been criticized for being largely invisible during the two weeks after the company announced jan  the gas pedal recall in the us europe and china he apologized at his first public press conference last friday but was criticized by the japanese media for failing to outline concrete steps to tackle the safety crisis and reassure customers around the world in contrast to his halting english in response to questions from foreign reporters at last weeks news conference toyoda seemed much better prepared tuesday reading from an english statement after doing so in japanese we will redouble our commitment to quality as a lifeline of our company he said in english we will do everything in our power to regain the confidence of our customers us safety officials have launched an investigation into problems with the brakes the problem is suspected in four crashes resulting in two minor injuries according to data gathered by the national highway traffic safety administration which is investigating the matter toyota says its cooperating with nhtsas investigation problems with hybrid braking systems havent been limited to toyota ford motor co said last week it plans to fix  mercury milan and ford fusion gaselectric hybrids because of a software problem that can give drivers the impression that the brakes have failed the automaker says the problem occurs in transition between two braking systems and at no time are drivers without brakes toyotas plugin hybrid is also being recalled in japan – a largely experimental model for rental and government use with  sold the prius holds a cherished spot in toyotas vehicle lineup and is symbolic of its leadership in the green car market toyota was one of the first companies to massmarket a hybrid that combines an electric motor with a gas engine introducing the prius in japan in  its high gas mileage made it popular among environmentally conscious drivers especially when gas prices spiked two years ago but the complexity of the prius a highly computerized car has led to problems in the past in  the company repaired  of them to fix software glitches that caused the engine to stall it has also had trouble with headlights going out  associated press writers mari yamaguchi shino yuasa

are you maybe looking for firebase instead data dumps the freebase api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
