quality report pqr a new analytics tool that enables corporations and patent professionals to rapidly assess the technical quality of a patent application at any stagethe patent quality report pqr tool uses natural language processing technology and five validation algorithms to instantly identify quality gaps in any patent application whether the application is in draft postgrant or anywhere in between the report which is produced in seconds provides a highly informative easytodigest summary of potential errors that may result in  rejections restrict the scope of a patent or weaken a patent during prosecution or litigationpatent quality is one of the hottest topics in patent prosecution right now the patent office has made patent quality a top ongoing priority and has rightly indicated they cant do it alone the patent bar needs to step up and produce higher quality patent applications which will result in faster and more consistent prosecution and more valid enforceable and defensible patent grants low quality patents mean low customer satisfaction with the patent system they are bad for patent owners bad for the patent office and bad for business said charles mirho turbopatent cofounder and general counselfor corporations pqr not only reduces the time and expense in patent prosecution creates stronger patents and decreases litigation risks but also serves as an inexpensive way to quickly and accurately evaluate the workproduct of the intellectual property professionals that draft and prosecute their patentsmost corporations have handled their patent costs by using a fixed fee billing approach which has put a lot of time pressure on their patent practitioners as a result the quality of the workproduct and the ability to monitor and track it has suffered we know this because weve been able to use our analytics technologies on tens of thousands of pending and granted patents which revealed significant defects that would pose great risks in postgrant proceedings with turbopatents pqr and other analytics services corporate patent managers can now easily monitor workflow and ensure that quality is not being compromised said james billmaier cofounder
