the news sent straight to you edition us arabi australia brasil canada deutschland españa france greece india italia japan korea maghreb méxico québec south africa united kingdom united states close the blog   am et  updated oct   the false promise of the prosperity gospel why i called out joel osteen and joyce meyer by pastor rick henderson getty k i have been preaching for  years yesterday i did something that i have never done before in a sermon i publicly called out false teachers and named them by name i said if you listen to joel osteen and joyce meyer if you take what they teach seriously it will not be good for you it will be detrimental to your longterm growth as a follower of jesus you can watch my sermon here i used to think that their error was so blatantly obvious that they could just be ignored i was wrong they are massively growing in popularity in the evangelical world and are seen as credible and helpful before im inundated with questioning emails i want to share why i distrust these two and think you should as well so dont shoot me  at least not yet when i was a kid i could tell the difference between neighborhood kids who wanted to be my friend from the neighborhood kids who were my friends so that they could play with my toys joel and joyce are the latter they both teach a twisted form of christianity that teaches obedience giving and faith as a way to get things from god they are both products of what is known as the prosperity gospel and the word of faith movement or the seed faith movement dangers of the prosperity gospel john piper does a great job of defining what the prosperity gospel is and why it is so sinister please take a few minutes to watch this before moving on the critiques of joyce meyer and joel osteen joyce meyer when i first heard her tell her story i was deeply moved and impressed she is an amazing example of overcoming hurts and abuse she will forever have my admiration and respect in that regard furthermore she gives spectacular advice if my wife or if one of my daughters went to her in a moment of crisis i believe they would return with magnificently helpful advice if they went to her for teaching they would return with deadly heresy false doctrine  she teaches that jesus literally stopped being the son of god on the cross listen here he could have helped himself up until the point where he said i commend my spirit into your hands at that point he couldnt do nothing for himself anymore he had become sin he was no longer the son of god he was sin  she teaches that jesus went to hell and became the firstborn again man listen here do you know something the minute that blood sacrifice was accepted jesus was the first human being that was ever born again now that was real it happened when he was in hell  she teaches that jesus paid for our sins in hell there is no hope of anyone going to heaven unless they believe this truth i am presenting you cannot go to heaven unless you believe with all your heart that jesus took your place in hell from the most important decision you will ever make  she teaches that words have power and you can release the power of heaven through your words  she teaches that you need special revelation from god to understand what she teaches because it is not contained in the bible listen here the bible cant even find any way to explain this not really thats why youve got to get it by revelation there are no words to explain what im telling you ive got to just trust god that hes putting it into your spirit like he put it into mine from what happened from the cross to the throne now spirits dont have bodies so we cant see them okay there probably is i believe there is and i certainly hope there is several angels up here this morning that are preaching with me i believe that right before i speak some anointed statement to you that one of them bends over and says in my ear what im supposed to say to you from witchcraft  related spirits part    a audiotape  she teaches that she is no longer a sinner unfortunately i could continue with examples of her utter misuse of scripture false teaching and blatant heresy in america christians have an embarrassment of riches we can buy more books download more podcasts and tune into more helpful teachers than anyone else on the planet the lies that she teaches are easily lost in the hum of all the great teachers we hear but this is not the case in the third world in many other countries their resources are far fewer uneducated pastors who are doing their very best and uninformed christians have this garbage pumped into their countries through radio waves and tv broadcasts because joyce meyer is endorsed here she is trusted there and she can afford to spread her message with the money she makes from american christians who buy her books cds and who attend her conferences her influence is severely disrupting the church in the third world her teachings are the unfortunate starting point for christians in the third world and it is birthing even greater heresies the devastating reality that we have to come to grips with is that when we support her here we support the churches she is undoing there financial concerns there is nothing wrong with being wealthy i love it when christians are rich that should mean more money to fund the mission but there is a line to how much money we as leaders should spend on ourselves i dont know where the line is but it is somewhere before the ministry purchasing million dollar homes for us and our kids that line is somewhere before purchasing us a  million private jet the line is somewhere before the ministry spending   for  pieces of furniture that equates to  per item that line is somewhere before spending so egregiously that the us senate investigates us joyce meyer lands on the other side of that line the following link includes audio from joyce meyer around  she is asked if people will get more money back to them if they give financially to her ministry not only does she teach giving as a way to leverage more money from god she is reckless with desperate people she is not at all concerned if people give to her instead of paying bills this is intolerable questionable example and lack of accountability i challenge you to watch a typical message by joyce meyer here are a few of things you will notice she pauses about every five minutes for applause and if people dont applaud she is likely to say something like im preaching better than youre acting she talks about herself constantly she is the main character in every story she tells even when she talks about herself in a selfdeprecating way some how it comes across in a way that causes people to admire her more god talks to her and reveals new information to her a lot her ministry lacks real accountability her family and her close friends are the governing board this is an organization that receives almost  million dollars annually and with no substantive accountability conclusion for joyce meyer what i wrote and linked in the first section should have been enough to completely remove her from our sphere of trust her doctrine is horrific her hermeneutics are horrible she is a woman who seems to have an unrestrained love for money and applause her finances are questionable at best her example is questionable at best her impact on desperate people here as well as churches and pastors around the globe is wildly destructive i lament with you a sense of loss if she was a teacher you trusted i lament that someone who is so wrong has so much influence with so many i do not regret however pointing to her as a false teacher and as one who should be rejected joel osteen like joyce meyer joel osteen has some really great things to say he is encouraging and the man is certainly happy this should not be held against him the man is confused on theology he has much of the same doctrinal misunderstandings as does joyce meyer they come from the same tradition his doctrine is difficult to discern for many because he wont talk about doctrine he wont talk about theology he quickly back pedals when asked hard questions as seen here in an interview with larry king in fairness joel published a letter of apology after this interview while i commend him for his humility and courage to publicly declare that he was wrong this is just one of too many instances he frequently misunderstands important matters of faith and doctrine when being interviewed he repeatedly gets the gospel wrong and he does so when talking to millions if we take joel at his word our only conclusion is that he is either incapable or unwilling to understand and explain how the gospel intersects with all of life we recently hosted hank hanegraaff the bible answerman at smcc he has some very helpful insights here and here into joel osteens confused views of faith doctrine and scripture joel osteen and prosperity gospel the prosperity gospel is much like all other religions in that it uses faith it uses doing good things to leverage material blessings from god essentially use god to get things from god god has already done everything hes going to do the ball is now in your court if you want success if you want wisdom if you want to be prosperous and healthy youre going to have to do more than meditate and believe you must boldly declare words of faith and victory over yourself and your family from your best life now p if you are believing for your child to find god go help somebody elses child to develop a relationship with god if youre struggling financially go out and help somebody who has less than you have  f you want to reap financial blessings you must sow financial seeds in the lives of others  if you want to see healing and restoration come to your life go out and help somebody else get well from your best life now pp   this is not the gospel this is a false gospel joel teaches that we open ourselves to god to get more from god he teaches that we use our words to speak into existence a better reality this straight from the word of faith movement this is not what is taught throughout the new testament consider what the apostle paul wrote and remember that he wrote this while in prison philippians  i rejoiced greatly in the lord that at last you renewed your concern for me indeed you were concerned but you had no opportunity to show it i am not saying this because i am in need for i have learned to be content whatever the circumstances i know what it is to be in need and i know what it is to have plenty i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry whether living in plenty or in want i can do all this through him who gives me strength conclusion when i was in seminary heather and i were poor there were seasons in which i worked  hours a week while taking a fulltime masters load there were times that i had to sleep every other day so that i could get all my work done this was an extended period of exhausting financial stress during this time i remember reading something from joel osteen he and his wife claimed by faith a new house that they wanted joel was unsure but his wife victoria was confident and she lovingly chastised him for his lack of faith sometime later they purchased that house still in seminary my wife and i were walking through our dream neighborhood and that was playing through my mind as i walked through the neighborhood looking at all the homes i wanted so badly for what joel is teaching to be true i dont know if you can understand how desperately i wanted it to be true i wanted relief and i wanted more but i knew that it wasnt true i knew that my exhaustion and desperation made me emotionally vulnerable to this false gospel im educated and well read ive havent just read the bible ive translated large chunks of it from the original hebrew and greek i think i understand it i think i have a relatively significant level of discernment but for a moment i was emotionally vulnerable to this false doctrine what about the millions of others who are desperate searching hoping and vulnerable without the discernment we

his company and his view of the markets they serve joel meyer president  ceo getappcom who are you are and what is your role in the company meyer president  ceo getappcom can you briefly present your management team meyer joel meyer president and travis prowell vp of engineering lead asa joel handles the strategic direction of the company and general financial and management issues joel holds a bachelors degree from valparaiso university and an mba from the university of chicago travis handles product development and engineering for asa travis holds a bachelors degree from the university of california berkeley he has a long history of developing innovative online solutions for companies like esurance oacis healthcare and microsoft getappcom are you a cloud or a softwareasaservice saas company meyer we offer a softwareasaservice product called asap yet at the same time offer cloud services to the clients using some of our legacy products getappcom how do you use and promote usage of cloud computing meyer asa has been making use of cloud computing for many years starting out by hosting many of its clients on its own servers asa built the next generation of asap to take full advantage of cloud computing including using the flexibility of adding computing power as needed during peak registration times while cutting back on power and usage when registrations are slowest cloud computing also gives asa the ability to maintain backups of the vital data it stores on behalf of clients in several locations greatly minimizing the risk of a natural or manmade disaster impacting its operations getappcom what are the points of difference of your solutions meyer the customization of asap and ability to change the visual nature and appearance of the program to fit into a clients website is important to maintain a clients brand and image our pricing model is based on a payasyougo approach where asa earns revenue by the transaction not the number of classes signed up for or the cost of the class whether the classevent is  or  and whether the patron signs up for one or an entire family at a time we charge the same transaction fee we also have realtime reporting and data analysis available to our clients and our clients can make realtime updates to the online registration site getappcom how would you like to be evaluated by a prospect meyer asa stresses to new clients to pay particular attention to the easeofuse of asap the customization clients can use to brand their registration site and make it visually appealing and the customer support offered to assist in both implementation and ongoing use of asap we also highlight what we call our powertoprice ratio asap is the most powerful option in our price range getappcom why do your customers buy from you meyer our reputation for service and willingness to work with clients to get asap our service team is usbased and answer the phone directly versus using a callcenter approach asa adds many enhancements to asap as a direct result of feedback and recommendations from its clients getappcom can you mention some of your key clients meyer key clients include park  recreation clients in both affluent and lower income areas large universities special programs departments and many public and private agencies getappcom what do you see as the key trend emerging in the industry meyer we see two main trends that are related to each other first our clients realize the need to get their operations online but they are just beginning to understand and demand the additional tools that allow them maximize their efforts examples include tools such as surveys online class content management and teacherstudent interaction second those same clients are also moving from having a simple website with basic class listings to spending the time and money to create attractive and visually appealing websites asap is a great resource for these clients on both regards as our customization allows them to carry the new look and feel from their website into our asap product using our sitewrap and our class management options help the office staff and teacher make the most of the tools available to them getappcom what is the most important message you feel you should get across to someone considering buying your solutions meyer there is not a more powerful affordable class management and registration solution on the market getappcom thanks for your time joel commentshomebrowsetop appsblogsign injoin sign up  sign inboth new and existing users can sign in with linkedin sign in with
