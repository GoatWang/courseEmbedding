that are considered more valueoriented relative to the overall market as defined by russell¿s leading style methodology the russell ® value index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the smallcap value segment the index is completely reconstituted annually to ensure larger stocks do not distort the performance and characteristics of the true smallcap opportunity set and that the represented companies continue to reflect value characteristicspriceearnings for a stock is the ratio of the companys most recent monthend share price to the companys estimated earnings

average historical earnings growth rates price earnings is one of the five value factors used to calculate the morningstar style box for portfolios this historical pe data point is calculated by taking an assetweighted average of the earnings yields ep of all the stocks in the portfolio and then taking the reciprocal of the result source morningstarreflects the percentage of a funds movements that can be explained by movements in a particular benchmark an rsquared of  indicates fund movements that are perfectly correlated to those of the benchmark in order to compare funds across general asset classes morningstar calculates rsquared values relative to a standard broadbased market index for example the rsquared of both a small cap domestic equity fund and a domestic technology fund

potential asset classes include but arent limited to real estate gold and currencyimpact of risk tolerance on portfolio allocationswhile a financial advisor can develop a generic portfolio model for an individual an investors risk tolerance should have a significant impact on what a portfolio looks likefor example a conservative investor might favor a portfolio with largecap value stocks broadbased market index funds investmentgrade bonds and a position in liquid highgrade cash equivalents in contrast a risktolerant investor might add some smallcap growth stocks to an aggressive largecap growth stock position assume some highyield bond exposure and look to real estate international and alternative investment opportunities for his portfolioin general an investor should minimize exposure to securities or asset classes whose volatility makes him uncomfortableimpact of time horizon on portfolio allocationssimilar to risk tolerance investors should consider how long they have to invest when building a portfolio investors should generally be moving to a more conservative asset allocation as the goal date approaches to protect the portfolios principal that has been built up to that pointfor example an investor saving for retirement may be planning to leave the workforce in five years despite the investors comfort level investing in stocks and other risky securities he may want to invest a larger portion of the portfolios balance in more conservative assets such as bonds and cash to help protect what has already been saved conversely an individual just entering the workforce may want to invest his entire portfolio in stocks since he may have decades to invest and has the ability to ride out some of the markets shortterm volatilityboth risk tolerance
