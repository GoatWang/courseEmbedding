enterprises inc formerly bullsnbearscom inc   notes to the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements    nature of operations and continuance of business   the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by michael james enterprises inc formerly bullsnbearscom inc the “ company ”  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the rules of the securities and exchange commission the “ sec ”  we suggest that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our form k for the year ended december   as filed with the sec we believe that all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein and that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year as reported in form k have been omitted   on december   the company formed a new whollyowned corporation bullsnbears holdings inc for the purpose of holding the company ’ s intellectual property assets   the financial statements presented are those of michael james enterprises inc formerly bullsnbearscom inc the company formerly spicy gourmet manufacturing inc a delaware corporation the company was incorporated on december   under the laws of the state of delaware during november  the company changed its name from spicy gourmet manufacturing inc to bullsnbearscom inc and changed its name to michael james enterprises inc   going concern   these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which implies that the company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business during the period from inception through june   the company has generated minimal revenues and has an accumulated deficit of  the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management its ability to generate profits from the company ’ s future operations identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the company ’ s ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern      principles of consolidation the accompanying financial statements reflect the consolidation of the individual financial statements of michael james enterprises inc and bullsnbears holdings inc all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated basic and diluted loss per share the company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share eps on the face of the income statement basic eps is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders numerator by the weighted average number of shares outstanding denominator during the period diluted eps gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including convertible debt stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method and convertible securities using the ifconverted method in computing diluted eps the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants diluted eps excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is antidilutive the company had net losses as of june   and  so the diluted eps excluded all dilutive potential shares in the diluted eps because their effect is antidilutive as of june   and june   the company had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock the company also had outstanding convertible note that could be converted into  shares and  shares as of june   and  respectively   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates fair value of financial instruments the carrying amount of accounts payable and accrued expenses are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the shortterm nature of these financial instruments the fair value of the derivative liabilities have been valued using a black scholes valuation model derivative liabilities certain of the company ’ s convertible notes payable described in note  contain conversion features that qualify for embedded derivative classification the company accounts for the embedded derivative features in its convertible debentures in accordance fasb asc  derivatives and hedging which requires a periodic valuation of their fair value and a corresponding recognition of liabilities associated with such derivatives the recognition of derivative liabilities related to the issuance of the convertible debt is applied first to the proceeds of such issuance as a debt discount at the date of issuance and the excess of derivative liabilities over the proceeds is recognized as a “ loss on derivative liability ” in other expense the fair value of these liabilities will be remeasured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivative financial instruments       new accounting pronouncements      in august  the financial accounting standards board  “ fasb ”  issued accounting standards update  “ asu ”   “ presentation of financial statements — going concern ” outlining management ’ s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity ’ s ability to continue as a going concern along with the required disclosures asu  is effective for the annual period ending after december   with early adoption permitted the company does not anticipate a material impact to our financial statements as a result of this change   in april  the fasb issued asu  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  “ asu  ”  asu  changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements by requiring them to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense there is no change to the current guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs for public business entities asu  will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted the company does not expect asu  to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in january  the fasb issued asu  “ financial instrumentsoverall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities ” which revises an entity ’ s accounting related to  the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and  the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value the asu also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments asu  is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted under certain circumstances ” the company is currently assessing the impact of asu  on its financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu no  leases which is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted under accounting standards update  lessees will be required to recognize for all leases at the commencement date a lease liability which is a lessee ’ s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a righttouse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee ’ s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures   in march  the fasb issued asu no  compensation — stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for sharebased payments including treatment of excess tax benefits and forfeitures as well as consideration of minimum statutory tax withholding requirements the asu will take effect for public companies for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early application permitted in any interim or annual period the company is evaluating the future impact of this asu on the consolidated financial statements   other relevant recently issued accounting updates are not expected to have a material impact on the company ’ s consolidated financial statements        note   related party transactions

consolidated unaudited financial statements  nature of operations and continuance of business the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by michael james enterprises inc formerly bullsnbearscom inc the “ company ”  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the rules of the securities and exchange commission the “ sec ”  we suggest that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our form k for the year ended december   as filed with the sec we believe that all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein and that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year as reported in form k have been omitted we are a company focused on developing intellectual property contracting out the manufacturing of the products covered by the intellectual property and bringing to market these products through direct to consumer sales utilizing digital media infomercials as well as distribution through third party vendors and retail outlets our first product luna is an alchemy of essential oils and peptide the company has begun to generate limited sales of luna at  per unit selling approximately   milliliter bottles currently the main product the company is working toward manufacturing and developing a market for is voluptas a female sexual arousal enhancer a provisional patent for voluptas has been filed and the company is currently engaged with a manufacturer in texas to create d molds and will take the product through all of the necessary stability tests required over the next approximately  months in preparation to bring this product to market final pricing for the voluptas has not been decided upon but the expected price is in the  range the company is also looking to partner with third party companies to collaborate with them on marking and distributing private label products under the mjtv brand our goal is to create a well known brand and distribution network that will not only serve as a viable sales and distribution channel for the company ’ s products but also for third party vendors and their products the company is focused on branding its catch phrase “ beauty backed by science ”  meaning science backed products that enhance the inner beauty as well as the outer beauty of all people with an emphasis on women the company has also launched a new marketing campaign with a new logo in the shape of a woman with words written inside of the woman describing “ what is a beautiful woman ” we call this woman “ beauty ”    competition most of our competitors are wellestablished networks that have substantially greater financial resources than we do however these large companies are bio pharmaceutical companies such as palatin technologies and amag pharmaceutical partnering on a female sexual dysfunction product that has completed phase  trials these two companies expect to go through the fda approval  process in order to bring their product to market as an fda approved drug and will begin the that process in the middle to late  it customarily takes about  years to get through the fda approval process without certainty of getting final approval mjtv will be bringing voluptas to the market as an overthecounter product and will not be making any specific medical claims additionally their delivery method is an autoinject epi pen into the woman ’ s stomach our delivery method is a noninvasive application a provisional patent has been filed protecting multiple delivery methods making entry by a third party very difficult  we feel strongly that we will be to market before palatin and amag and that our delivery method will be widely accepted and viewed more favorable than an injection into the stomach  other competitors include sex dust tree bark powder that has been considered not effective with side effects including upset stomach and vomiting  adi is also on the market as an fda approved female sexual dysfunction drug but is also not considered very effective which has led to very limited sales there are several vaginal gels on the market that claim to help excite a women providing tingling or warming sensations there is also an established market for essential oils making the entry of luna and other soon to be developed essential oil mixtures difficult for mjtv to penetrate and gain market share in this essential oil segment there are no assurances that we will ever effectively compete in our target market acquisition of rp capital in place of the proposed acquisition of michael james enterprises inc nevada on august   the company ’ s board of directors approved an asset purchase agreement with rp capital group ltd to acquire all rights and title to the studies and intellectual property to a dranabinol based treatment for sleep apnea this acquisition substituted the contemplated acquisition of michael james enterprises inc a nevada corporation the michael james enterprises inc acquisition did not move forward as the acne based product it was bringing to marked has experienced several significant set backs and the board of directors has determined that the proposed agreement was not in the best interest of the company and its shareholders   our history we were organized under the laws of the state of delaware on december   under the name spicy gourmet international inc as part of the implementation of the chapter  plan of reorganization of spicy gourmet organics inc sgo a california corporation sgo was incorporated in the state of california in  and was formed to import specialty organic spices from south asia and sell them in the united states sgo was undercapitalized and sales of its spice products were slow to develop possibly due to the recession in the  time period as a result sgo lacked sufficient cash flow to meet its current obligations and on october   sgo filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter  in the us bankruptcy court for the central district of california sgos plan of reorganization was confirmed by the court on november   the plan of reorganization provided for the acquisition by sgo of a new unrelated retail business and the spinoff of all of the various elements of sgos spice business to four different entities the plan of reorganization called for the spinoff of sgos manufacturing business to our company the incorporation of our company and the distribution of shares of our common stock to the bankruptcy creditors the plan required us to issue  shares of our common stock and distribute these to sgos general unsecured creditors to its administrative creditors and to its shareholders the shares were distributed pursuant to section  of the us bankruptcy code  the court also ordered the distribution of warrants to all administrative creditors of sgo with these creditors to receive five warrants exercisable into shares of our common stock for each  of sgos administrative debt which they held these creditors received an aggregate of  warrants consisting of ·  a warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of  ·  b warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of  ·  c warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of  ·  d warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of  and ·  e warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of  all warrants are exercisable at any time prior to november   as a result of a twoyear extension this warrants distribution also took place on december   during october  we agreed to reduce the exercise price of the outstanding warrants to  per share we were a “ shell company ” as that term is defined in the securities act of  from our date of incorporation until october  on october   we acquired from james m palladino then an unrelated third party the url domain name and websites of bullsnbearscom for  following this asset purchase we were no longer considered a “ shell company ” on october   our former officers and directors resigned and certain of the then officers and directors were appointed with the balance of our directors being newly appointed in december  in november  we changed our name to bullsnbearscom inc effective december   we changed our name to michael james enterprises inc and entered into an agreement for plan of merger and reorganization between the company and michael james enterprises inc a nevada corporation  on august   the company changed its direction and decided to acquire rp capital group ltd and all of its intellectual property associated with a dronabinol based treatment for sleep apnea additionally the company decided to develop and bring to market a female sexual arousal enhancer – voluptas trademark and patent aplications were filed and the company is currently in the process of securing  of funding to manufacture and bring to market this product there is no guarantee these funds will be raised on december   the company formed a new whollyowned company bullsnbears holdings llc for the purpose of holding the company ’ s intellectual property assets  as contractually agreed to the companys whollyowned subsidiary bullsnbears holdings llc was spun off in its entirety including all of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary including certain liabilities of the parent company that were incurred by the previous management including bullsnbears holdings llc intellectual property assets including its websites url ’ s and proprietary software were  tranfrred through a share dividend to mjtv shareholders of record as of the close of business on december   with one share of bullsnbears holdings llc  common stock distributed for each one share of mjtv common stock owned as of the record date  distribution of the shares took place on december   prior to that effective december   the company filed an amendment to the company ’ s articles of incorporation changing the company ’ s name to “ michael james enterprises inc ” and filed with finra for a new stock ticker symbol “ mjtv ”  since august of  the company created the alchemy of essential oils called luna to help a person relax and hopefully achieve better sleep additionally the company ’ s ceo james m farinella designed a creative non invasive delivery system for an active ingredient which was assigned to the company by the ceo in exchange for   preferred b shares this product voluptas now patent pending with a filing for a trademark on the name voluptas on april   the company changes its name to mj biotech inc to better represent the new direction of the company going concern these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which implies that the company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business during the period from inception through march   the company has generated minimal revenues and has an accumulated deficit of  the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management its ability to generate profits from the company ’ s future operations identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the company ’ s ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern  principles of consolidation the accompanying financial statements reflect the the individual financial statements of michael james enterprises inc taking into account the spin off of bullsnbears holdings llc all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated basic and diluted loss per share the company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share eps on the face of the income statement basic eps is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders numerator by the weighted average number of shares outstanding denominator during the period diluted eps gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including convertible debt stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method and convertible securities using the ifconverted method in computing diluted eps the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants diluted eps excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is antidilutive the company had net losses as of march   and  so the diluted eps excluded all dilutive potential shares in the diluted eps because their effect is antidilutive as of march   and march   the company had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock the company also had outstanding convertible note that could be converted into  shares and  shares as of march   and  respectively however these notes were included in the spin off of bullsnbears holdings llc on december   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates fair value of financial instruments the carrying amount of accounts payable and accrued expenses are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the shortterm nature of these financial instruments the fair value of the derivative liabilities have been valued using a black scholes valuation model derivative liabilities certain of the company ’ s convertible notes payable described in note  contain conversion features that qualify for embedded derivative classification the company accounts for the embedded derivative features in its convertible debentures in accordance fasb asc  derivatives and hedging which requires a periodic valuation of their fair value and a corresponding recognition of liabilities associated with such derivatives the recognition of derivative liabilities related to the issuance of the convertible debt is applied first to the proceeds of such issuance as a debt discount at the date of issuance and the excess of derivative liabilities over the proceeds is recognized as a ” loss on derivative liability ” in other expense the fair value of these liabilities will be remeasured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivative financial instruments  new accounting pronouncements   in august  the financial accounting standards board  “ fasb ”  issued accounting standards update  “ asu ”   “ presentation of financial statements — going concern ” outlining management ’ s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity ’ s ability to continue as a going concern along with the required disclosures asu  is

april  the fasb issued asu  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  “ asu  ”  asu  changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements by requiring them to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense there is no change to the current guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs for public business entities asu  will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted the company does not expect asu  to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in january  the fasb issued asu  “ financial instrumentsoverall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities ” which revises an entity ’ s accounting related to  the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and  the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value the asu also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments asu  is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted under certain circumstances ” the company is currently assessing the impact of asu  on its financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu no  leases which is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted under accounting standards update  lessees will be required to recognize for all leases at the commencement date a lease liability which is a lessee ’ s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a righttouse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee ’ s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures   in march  the fasb issued asu no  compensation — stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for sharebased payments including treatment of excess tax benefits and forfeitures as well as consideration of minimum statutory tax withholding requirements the asu will take effect for public companies for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early application permitted in any interim or annual period the company is
