small ideas interview with irobot’s colin angle  the mit entrepreneurship review where einstein meets edison our mission our team writing contest events contact us energy science  healthcare web mobile  hardware startup advice interviews home » interviews » big inventions from small ideas interview with irobot’s colin angle by grace young in interviews web mobile  hardware   comments jan   renowned roboticist and inventor colin angle is cofounder ceo and chairman of the board of irobot maker of the iconic roomba vacuum cleaner bombdefusing packbot and many other products that have revolutionized life from living rooms to battlefields he started irobot midway through his doctoral program after earning a bs in electrical engineering and ms in computer science from mit and managed to incubate and grow the company without initial vc backing today irobot is a  million publiclytraded company that thrives on bringing innovative ideas to market and solving real world problems    miter you’ve said your dream was to build a company that can really change the world how is irobot fulfilling your dream   colin angle in more ways than i could have hoped our early work on small robots to explore other planets helped shift nasa’s focus to radically smaller rovers than they had been working on and led to sojourner spirit and opportunity our roomba robot floor vacuum has changed people’s perceptions of what a robot is and can be with over five million sold the roomba is making people’s lives all over the world a bit easier   miter statistically it’s very difficult to replicate the “labtomarket” success of irobot how did you and your cofounders do it   colin angle by focusing on developing technology that enables a whole new class of products ie robots and answering the driving needs of customers robots are not a singular point solution for one problem but a class of general purpose technology that can be used in many places by staying true to both of the above ideas we can continue to innovate and deliver successful products   miter you said you consider yourself sufficiently crazy to try new things is this an important characteristic of entrepreneurship if so can you give a personal example   colin angle if you are not willing to take carefully considered risks change your role in the company as the company grows and do what is needed even if it is unpleasant you are going to have a hard time with entrepreneurship unless you are very lucky we kept looking for new long term applications for robots even after failing to find ones ten years after we started that might seem extreme but that’s what it took for us to succeed   miter as irobot has grown into a large public company is it difficult to balance the interests of your shareholders with scientific andor altruistic impulses   colin angle there are certainly more ideas than we can afford to pursue but part of the plan for helping to usher in the robot age is showing that it is not only cool but also good business by making some money we can generate resources to acquire key technologies or products to add to our portfolio by showing the world that robots are good business we encourage others to join the space and help build out the industry so there are certainly limitations to being a public company but these limitations are compatible with our mission   miter how has your role in the company changed since the beginning   colin angle i often joke that my role changes every six months in the beginning i did a lot of soldering now i do a lot of communicating to investors and employees in the beginning i was physically building robots now i’m focused on building a company that builds robots luckily i have grown with the company and still love what i do   miter what major setbacks if any did you encounter while building irobot and how did you overcome them   colin angle not sure your article could be long enough to capture all of them we were not vc backed in the beginning so cash flow was always a problem in fact we went six years never having enough cash in the bank at the start of a given month to make payroll at the end of the month that taught us to be incredibly careful with how we spent money and have multiple plans for how we would bring in cash as a result we never missed payroll and our employees felt confident the company was stable we also entered and exited over  different product lines before finding economic success with roomba and packbot   miter is there any skill or discipline you wish you had learned before starting irobot   colin angle i think irobot would have benefitted and moved more quickly to success if i had a greater appreciation for understanding customer needs both what they need and what they don’t not something that comes naturally to engineers   miter how does interaction with customers help you define irobot as a company   colin angle our goal is to make robots that solve real problems so our robots can deliver real value to our customers if roomba had great intelligence and navigational ability but didn’t clean all the way up to the edges of your room then it would be a very limited and thus unsuccessful product in the end robots either do the job or they don’t and it’s the customers who get to vote we exist to serve them not the other way around   miter how does irobot today compare to your original vision for the company   colin angle it still seems like we are just getting started the opportunity and potential for robots is so big i’ve been at it for  years and i can’t imagine doing anything else   miter you’ve said “small efforts can change the world” how has this worked in your life   colin angle i’m constantly surprised by the impact we have we are just one company most recently we have launched programs to help inspire kids to pursue science technology engineering and math careers by exposing them to robotics now we have a national robotics week and tens of thousands of kids last year got excited about science who may not have before all germinating from the notion “hey this is a good idea let’s try it”    miter what advice would you give to entrepreneurs who aspire to be positive change agents   colin angle know why you are doing it because it can be a long road it can also be one of the most rewarding things you ever do about
