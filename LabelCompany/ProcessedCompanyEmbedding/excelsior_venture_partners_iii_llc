when it determines that such distribution is in the best interests of excelsior and its members each member will be allocated securities distributed in kind in proportion to the members ownership interest in excelsior cash will be distributed in lieu of fractional share interests  securities distributed in kind by excelsior in conjunction with this application will be listed on a national securities exchange or on the nasdaq stock market and will not be subject to legal or contractual restrictions on their resale these securities will be valued at the average of the closing bid and ask price or in the case of exchange traded securities the closing price of the five days immediately preceding the distribution market liquidity will be an important factor in declaring distributions and excelsior will not distribute securities at any one time in an amount that is more than  of the outstanding shares of an issuer in those relatively infrequent situations when this restriction does not permit all of excelsiors holdings of an issuer to be distributed at one time applicants will closely monitor the market prior to any subsequent distribution to assure that the prior distribution is no longer significantly impacting the price of the securities excelsiors board of managers will in acting upon each proposed distribution consider whether a distribution of cash proceeds from a sale of

from registration pursuant to section b from entering into a contract that provides for compensation based upon “a share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client” commonly referred to as a “performance fee”  section b of the advisers act excepts from the performance fee prohibition of section a a contract between an investment adviser and a bdc that provides for compensation not in excess of “ per centum of the realized capital gains upon the funds of the bdc over a specified period or as of definite dates computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation” applicants assert that section b recognizes the appropriateness of a performance fee as compensation for advisers activities in light of the special nature of bdcs  section b of the advisers act however permits a performance fee only with respect to realized capital gains and does not contemplate the procedures set forth in the operating agreement whereby unrealized gains or losses will be deemed to be realized under certain conditions for purposes of calculating the incentive carried interest excelsiors performance fee is prohibited by section a and does not fall within the exception set out in section b  section a of the advisers act authorizes the sec by order upon application to conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person or start printed page transaction or any class or classes of persons or transactions from any provision of the advisers act “if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the advisers act”  applicants request that the sec grant an exemption from section a of the advisers act to permit excelsior to deem realized any unrealized gains or losses attributable to securities distributed in kind to its members for purposes of payment of the performance fee to the investment adviser and investment subadviser  applicants assert that their exemption from section a is consistent with the standards of section a regarding investor protection and the purposes of the advisers act applicants argue that congress has already found it appropriate to permit a performance fee in the case of an investment adviser to a bdc applicants argue further that to the extent that section b of the advisers act requires such a fee to be based on net realized capital gains applicants proposal is consistent with the statutory purposes once the inkind distribution is made excelsiors members and the members of the feeder fund will have the exclusive ability to liquidate such investments and realize any gains or losses applicants also assert that there should be no concern over the proper valuation of the securities upon which the fee is based because applicants are requesting exemptive relief only with respect to inkind distributions of securities for which a trading market exists on a national securities exchange or on the nasdaq stock market  applicants state that they believe that it is in the best interests of the members of excelsior and the members of the feeder fund and in the public interest for excelsior to make inkind distributions of securities applicants state that they believe that an inkind distribution would enable excelsiors members and the members of the feeder fund to maximize their investment first applicants state that the alternative to an inkind distribution is the sale of the securities and argue that such sales may have a negative effect on the price of the shares in the market second applicants represent that the securities to be distributed will be freely transferable and will not be subject to either legal or contractual restrictions on their sale moreover applicants represent that a distribution of securities will not constitute a taxable event with respect to excelsior its members and members of the feeder fund so that the members of excelsior and the feeder fund will in determining whether to hold or sell the securities control the timing of realization of capital gains or losses finally applicants assert that as a venture capital fund excelsior and its advisers have not held themselves out as having experience with respect to publicly traded securities and therefore its members do not lose any benefit of management expertise by receiving an inkind distribution of securities conditions applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions  the relief will only apply to the distribution in kind by excelsior of securities that are traded on a national securities exchange or on the nasdaq stock market and are subject to no legal or contractual restriction on their sale  securities distributed in kind pursuant to the relief will be valued at the average of the closing bid and asked price or in the case of exchangetraded securities the closing sale price at which the relevant securities were quoted on the relevant exchange or system during the five trading days immediately preceding the distribution members will receive notice of the basis for the valuation at the time of or before distribution  excelsior agrees to use all reasonable endeavors to ensure that securities that are the subject of an inkind distribution are transferred to its members as soon as practicable following their valuation in connection with the allocation of the incentive carried interest and in any event within  days thereof distributions will be recommended by applicants and the board of managers of excelsior will approve each distribution and establish its record date which will also be the valuation date prior to an inkind distribution members who are not account holders at us trust will be requested to provide brokerage instructions or establish an account if necessary and procedures will be followed to assure that members who respond on a timely basis will receive the portfolio securities promptly members that hold accounts at us trust will receive distributions within five  business days of the record date start signature for the sec by the division of investment management under delegated authority margaret h mcfarland deputy secretary end signature end
