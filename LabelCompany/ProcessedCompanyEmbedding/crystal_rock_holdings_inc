distribution growth plan and integrating acquired assets to become more profitable the following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statement establishing a new product channel such as office products requires a significant investment of money and management time and requires us to develop systems such as online ordering systems to an extent we have not done previously there is no assurance we can succeed there are many competitors in the office products business and some are bigger and better capitalized than we are to the extent that we try to grow that business by acquisitions we may experience difficulties integrating the acquired businesses or assets or we may fail to realize synergistic savings that we had hoped to realize even if we establish a new product channel it may not be profitable in our form k annual report for the fiscal year ended october   the reader is directed to the section entitled products and
