limine filed by plaintiff cdx liquidating trust by the cdx liquidating trustee plaintiff or cdx or trustee and on eleven motions in limine filed by venrock associates defendants or venrock et al cdxs first five motions in limine and defendants first ten motions in limine are the subject of this memorandum opinion and order these motions were referred by district court judge charles r norgle sr for resolution pursuant to  usc § b this court held oral argument on june  and   at which time the court made oral rulings this opinion provides a more complete explanation for those rulings i background facts the factual and procedural history of this case is complex therefore for purposes of this opinion this court sets forth only those details necessary to decide the motions presently pending before the court cdx formerly known as cadant filed this lawsuit on june   this case originated in bankruptcy court cadant filed for bankruptcy in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois on june   upon filing of the bankruptcy petition all of cadants alleged derivative claims became part of the estate in this lawsuit cdx alleges  from january  through may  all or most of the defendants spurned legitimate thirdparty financing in order to engage in selfdealing bridge loans on terms highly unfavorable to plaintiff  the rejection of the thirdparty financing offers was predicated on continued assurances from certain defendants they would support the company with fair and equitable financing and  subsequent to gaining control through bridge loans defendants sold the company to arris group inc arris with defendants—not shareholders—recovering funds through the sale dkt  former defendant venture law group was the debtors general counsel the remaining individual defendants provided financing to the debtor the trustee alleges defendants schemed to enrich themselves at the expense of the debtor and that defendants actions caused the debtor to take several shortterm loans on terms ensuring it would default from this default the lender and board member defendants would obtain the debtors assets based on those allegations the trustee asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duties negligence fraud conspiracy and equitable subordination in june  following the companys sale to arris cdx filed a petition under chapter  of the federal bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois bankruptcy judge eugene r wedoff approved a reorganization plan and closed all bankruptcy proceedings related to cdx on november   the plan included provisions for the commencement of this action the complaint initially listed sixteen causes of action defendants moved to strike the entire complaint pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b the motion was granted in part but denied with respect to plaintiffs claims for breach of fiduciary duty aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty civil conspiracy to breach fiduciary duties and equitable subordination defendants filed a motion to withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court before district judge ronald a guzman on august   judge guzman issued a memorandum opinion and order denying defendants motion judge guzman found inter alia that  although certain defendants had waived their right to a jury trial by filing proofs of claim they were entitled to rely on the trustees jury demand  given defendants repeated refusal to consent to a jury trial in the bankruptcy court any trial in this case must take place in the district court  although a withdrawal of reference was not appropriate at that time the court would reconsider the matter when the case was ready for trial and  the bankruptcy judge should preside over all pretrial matters through the close of discovery in october  plaintiff filed a motion to withdraw reference on february   judge guzman recused himself the case was reassigned to judge mark filip who struck the plaintiffs motion without prejudice dkts  on march   judge filip reinstated the case deemed the plaintiffs motion filed instanter and ordered the parties stand on previously filed briefs dkt  on may   judge filip recused himself dkt  the case was reassigned to judge norgle dkt  this case is set for trial before judge norgle in februrary  see dkt  the case was referred to this court in accordance with local rule  dkt  ii legal standards this court will discuss the applicable motion in limine legal standards and will then apply them to the fifteen motions in limine a motions in limine a motion in limine is a request for the courts guidance concerning an evidentiary question wilson v williams  fd   th cir  kiswani v phoenix security agency inc  frd   nd ill  the court may give such guidance by issuing a preliminary ruling regarding admissibility wilson  fd at  trial judges are authorized to rule on motions in limine pursuant to their authority to manage trials even though such rulings are not explicitly authorized by the federal rules of evidence luce v united states  us   n   while judges have broad discretion when ruling on motions in limine evidence may be excluded only when it is inadmissible on all potential grounds jenkins v chrysler motors corp  fd   th cir  townsend v benya  fsuppd   nd ill  unless evidence meets this high standard evidentiary rulings should be deferred until trial so that questions of foundation relevancy and potential prejudice may be resolved in proper context hawthorne partners v att techs inc  fsupp   nd ill  thus the party moving to exclude evidence in limine has the burden of establishing the evidence is not admissible for any purpose robenhorst v dematic corp  wl  at  nd ill april   denial of a motion in limine does not mean all evidence contemplated by the motion will be admitted at trial hawthorne  f supp at  rather denial means the court cannot determine whether the evidence in question should be excluded outside of the trial context united states v connelly  fd   th cir  a ruling is not necessarily final townsend  f supp d at  the ruling is subject to change when the case unfolds particularly if the actual testimony differs from what was proffered luce  us at  indeed even if nothing unexpected happens at trial the district judge is free in the exercise of sound judicial discretion to alter a previous in limine ruling id at  b evidence admissibility rules   and  of the federal rules of evidence govern which evidence is relevant and admissible in a proceeding relevant evidence is considered that which has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence fed r evid  the admissibility of evidence is characterized such that all relevant evidence is admissible evidence which is not relevant is not admissible fed r evid  relevant evidence might be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice confusion of the issue or misleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence fed r evid  evidence of other crimes wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith it may however be admissible for other purposes such as proof of motive opportunity intent preparation plan knowledge identity or absence of mistake or accident     fed r evid b rule  of the federal rules of evidence  rule  prohibits the admissibility of offers of promises for or completed settlement agreements fed r evid  rule  does not require exclusion if offered for a permissible purpose fed r evid a examples of permissible purposes include proving a witnesss bias or prejudice negating a contention of undue delay and proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution fed r evid a iii discussion a plaintiffs motions in limine with its first five motions plaintiff seeks to exclude any evidence testimony or argument regarding  cadants lawsuit against butler international inc butler  the worldwide financial i lp worldwide suit against frederick h kopko kopko jr mcbreen  kopko mcbreen and rimas buinevicius rimas  third party litigation filed against any of cadants founders and their affiliates  third party litigation filed against special counsel for the trustee and  claims filed by cadant common stockholders in the cdx bankruptcy each of these issues will be addressed in order  cadants lawsuit against butler international inc plaintiff seeks to exclude any evidence testimony or argument regarding cadants lawsuit against butler cadants lawsuit against buler came after butler and ed kopko refused to voluntarily lift its lien on the sale proceeds after cadant sold its assets to arris plaintiff argues cadants lawsuit against butler is nonprobative and not admissible defendants argue cadants lawsuit against butler is relevant and should be admitted for three reasons  the jury is entitled to hear about the obstructionist environment defendants faced which forced them into litigation  the conduct is consistent with other actions of obstruction which influenced defendants option and opportunities in later transactions and  the butler lien and lawsuit show bias of key plaintiff witnesses defendants argue cadants lawsuit against butler is relevant admissible evidence because it provides context for defendants actions in late  in connection with the arris sale and it goes to the bias and credibility of plaintiffs witnesses including fred and ed kopko defendants do not seek to offer at trial the  settlement between arris and butler the negotiations and terms of the settlement agreement between cadant arris and butler are not admissible in evidence pursuant to rule  defendants want to offer the refusal to release the lien the lawsuit and the temporary restraining order sunstar inc v albertoculver co inc no  c   wl  at  nd ill aug   conduct or statements not a part of compromise discussions are not subject to rule  this court grants plaintiffs motion in limine to exclude any evidence testimony or argument regarding cadants lawsuit against butler plaintiff brings two main claims against defendants  defendants breached their fiduciary duty and  defendants conspired to engage in selfdealing cadants lawsuit against butler does not relate to the arris sale the fact butler asserted a lien assertion does not change whether defendants breached their fiduciary duty difficulties in completing the sale to arris based on the lien is not probative of the fiduciary duty or other issues the jury will decide absent evidence to make the butler lawsuit relevant or probative during trial the butler and related lien lawsuit are not relevant and therefore not admissible  worldwide financial i lps lawsuit against frederick kopko et al plaintiff seeks to exclude any evidence testimony or argument made regarding worldwides lawsuit against kopko mcbreen and rimas plaintiff argues the worldwide lawsuit is inadmissible because the underlying issues in that case are not at issue in this case defendants do not intend to enter the settlement into evidence defendants argue worldwides lawsuit against kopko mcbreen and rimas is relevant because it shows  the expectations for what cadant was worth at the sale to arris and  bias of witnesses this court grants plaintiffs motion to exclude any evidence testimony or argument regarding worldwides lawsuit against kopko mcbreen and rimas plaintiff agreed to stipulate to the  per share price of cadant stock in the worldwide transaction as in indication of value transcript june   at p  therefore the transaction at  per share may be proffered as evidence the fact that litigation was instituted challenging the price is not probative the mere fact that an individual sues thinking a price is unfair does not make it so denson v northeast illinois regional commuter railroad corp no  c   wl  nd ill march   the existence of other lawsuits is not evidence that any of the claims in those lawsuits are true and admission of those allegations would be prejudicial davis v harris no   wl  at  cd ill dec    third party litigation filed against any of cadants founders and their affiliates or filed against special counsel for the trustee it should be noted that plaintiff combined its arguments for motions three and four in oral arguments defendants argued similarly thus this court will determine plaintiffs motions three and four in kind plaintiff seeks to exclude any evidence testimony or argument regarding third party litigation filed against any of cadants founders and their affiliates because the two lawsuits have no relation to cadant but instead involve butler  carley v butler international carley and  old oak partners llc v butler international old oak partners in carley stockholders sued butler and its directors for claims arising out of butlers efforts to obtain refinancing the case was dismissed at the pleading stage without discovery the defendants wish to proffer the carley case to prove that kopko and special counsel utlized bridge financing in their other ventures involving butler old oak partners is a case involving allegations of breach of fiduciary duty it was ultimately dismissed this court grants plaintiffs motion to exclude any evidence testimony or argument regarding the two third party cases filed against cadants founders and their affiliates neither the carley nor the old oak partners lawsuit is relevant to the issues at hand if however plaintiff asserts the use of bridge financing is never an appropriate financing mechanism it may be appropriate to allow evidence of plaintiffs past deals involving bridge financing at that point it would be defendants burden to actually show contextually a relevant comparison between the transaction at issue and a past deal  claims filed by cadant common stockholders in the cdx bankruptcy plaintiffs fifth motion seeks to exclude any evidence testimony or argument regarding claims filed by cadant common stockholders in the cdx bankruptcy plaintiff argues these claims are irrelevant and thus not admissible defendants argue the witnesses may provide slanted testimony and that the claims are directly relevant to the credibility of the witnesses this court denies in part and grants in part plaintiffs motion in limine regarding claims filed by cadant common stockholders in the cdx bankruptcy the fact of a witness claim in the bankruptcy proceeding may be relevant to show bias or interest in the outcome of this case however no signed documents regarding the claim need be introduced this court denies plaintiffs motion with respect to the fact of the claims this court grants plaintiffs motion with respect to the claim documents b defendants motions in limine with its first ten motions defendants seek to exclude  evidence regarding defendants conduct occurring before defendants joined cadants board of directors board and defendants conduct or events at arris occurring after cadant sold its assets to arris  opinion testimony from james stern john ostojic and fred kopko  testimony about the meaning and application of legal obligations and fiduciary duties  admission of the individual defendants compensation employment benefits and indemnification rights  evidence of defendants size wealth or resources  references to the rockefellers their wealth or their connection to the venrock defendants  references to other corporate scandals or infamous suits such as the enron or the worldcom litigation  evidence of unrelated deals involving venrock associates and venture law group  admission of omnibus categories on plaintiffs exhibit list and  argument that cadants reincorporation under delaware law was fraudulent or otherwise improper  defendants motion in limine to bar evidence regarding defendants conduct occurring before defendants joined cadants board and defendants conduct or events at arris occurring after cadant sold its assets to arris defendants first motion requests the court to exclude evidence of defendants conduct before defendants were elected to cadants board and after cadant was sold to arris defendants contend they only owed plaintiff a fiduciary duty between the time of defendants appointment and cadants sale rendering evidence outside that time frame irrelevant or likely to cause jury confusion a defendants motion to exclude evidence of defendants conduct before defendants joined cadants board defendants argue that evidence of defendants conduct before the individual defendants joined cadants board is inadmissible because the evidence will not be probative of the individual defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duty rather defendants claim that all evidence regarding their conduct before they assumed fiduciary obligations reasserts previously dismissed claims and will result in juror confusion defendants do not contest evidence that is both relevant and unrelated to defendants conduct which occurred prior to defendants appointment to the board plaintiff intends to present evidence prior to defendants appointment to cadants board to explain how cadant evolved financially and how cadants founders relied on defendants at various times specifically plaintiff would disclose the reasons cadants founding board accepted venture capital style preferred stock financing rather than common stock financing why venrock was chosen to lead the preferred stock round rather than other venture capital firms what assurances venrock provided cadants founding directors and the nature of mr copeland and mr rochkinds appointment to cadants board plaintiff claims this evidence will be proffered merely as an aid to understanding while defendants argue such evidence would revive previously dismissed fraud and negligence claims plaintiff may introduce evidence closely related to the dismissed fraud and negligence claims if the evidence is relevant to the surviving claims and not unduly prejudicial see vernon v port auth of ny and nj  fsuppd   sdny  thus for evidence regarding defendants conduct before defendants joined cadants board the parties can explain how individuals became directors by virtue of the financing agreement in addition the parties may address the directors deliberative process prior to the agreement by explaining how directors came to make various decisions however the parties are precluded from asserting alleged assurances provided during the course of negotiations that are not embodied in the series a written agreement finally defendants argue that evidence of defendants conduct before the individual defendants joined cadants board is irrelevant because they could not technically breach fiduciary duties before they legally owed such obligations the court agrees see premier capital mgmt llc v cohen no  c   wl  at  nd ill mar   only conduct after the establishment of an actual directorshareholder relationship will constitute breach of fiduciary duty in addition evidence of defendants conduct before they owed a fiduciary duty would be improper if merely intended to demonstrate defendants propensity to breach a fiduciary duty cf saudi basic industries corp v mobile yanbu petrochemical co no c  wl  at  del super ct sep   evidence offered toward the defendants internal state of mind regarding its supposed intentions before a defendant owed a fiduciary duty is precluded if intended to establish defendant would eventually breach a fiduciary duty however rather than excluding otherwise relevant evidence toward plaintiffs claims merely because the evidence arose before defendants assumed a fiduciary duty the court will take the remainder of defendants motion under advisement to be ruled on in the context of the evidence offered at trial see united states v connelly  fd   th cir  denial of a motion in limine does not necessarily mean that all evidence contemplated by the motion will be admitted at trial but instead merely means that without the context of trial the court is unable to determine whether the evidence in question should be excluded defendants motion is denied in part and granted in part while the court grants the motion with respect to the parties negotiations regarding the series a financing agreement the court declines to preclude evidence arising prior to defendants fiduciary obligations that explains the outcome of the financing agreement or individual directors deliberative process b defendants motion to exclude evidence of defendants conduct or events at arris occurring after cadant sold its assets to arris defendants also seek to exclude evidence of defendants conduct or events at arris after january   because plaintiff will purportedly offer evidence irrelevant to the liability phase of the bifurcated trial including but not limited to defendants conduct during bankruptcy litigation data regarding arris stock price and arris financial performance after acquiring cadants inventory similar to defendants motion to exclude conduct before the individual defendants joined cadants board defendants argue that evidence subsequent to defendants fiduciary duty is not probative of whether a fiduciary breach occurred because defendants allegedly owed no fiduciary duty to plaintiff after cadants sale plaintiff claims the events after cadants sale are probative of defendants alleged breach plaintiff intends to introduce postsale evidence related to cadants bankruptcy litigation and settlement agreements plaintiff argues the evidence brings into doubt the legitimacy of cadants asset sale for stock and shows that defendants deliberately refused to sell the arris stock so only the bridge lenders would receive value in cadants bankruptcy while the court recognizes that liability for breach of fiduciary duty hinges on defendants conduct during its duration of service at cadant evidence is not limited to the duration of defendants tenure the issue at trial is whether the postsale evidence sheds light on defendants conduct as board members postsale evidence will be allowed to the extent it is relevant to explain defendants conduct as board members defendants motion is granted with respect to arris financial performance after it acquired cadants assets and products arris success or failure following the sale is not probative as to whether defendants breached their fiduciary duty unless plaintiff can show that defendants had actual knowledge of arris plans prior to the sale and failed to share such information with fellow directors in the course of their deliberations  defendants motion to bar opinion testimony from james stern john ostojic and fred kopko defendants seek to exclude testimony of lay witnesses james stern stern john ostojic ostojic and fred kopko kopko regarding their opinions on cadant valuations at various points in time legal conclusions and the existence and scope of legal standards or duties defendants argue that stern ostojic and kopko will proffer opinion testimony inadmissible under rule  and improper under rule  notably defendants argument that stern ostojic and kopko should be precluded from testifying because of plaintiffs failure to disclose them as experts is moot because plaintiff concedes these witnesses will not be called to testify as experts in the field of law since plaintiff insists stern ostojic and kopko will testify as lay witnesses their opinions must be rationally based on personal knowledge helpful to a clear understanding of the witness testimony or the determination of a fact in issue and not based on scientific technical or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule  fed r evid  defendants believe stern and ostojic will not offer opinions based on firsthand knowledge required under rule  while plaintiff insists that all three witnesses will testify only when they have personal knowledge defendants are also concerned the witnesses will offer opinions based on technical or specialized knowledge plaintiff will ask former cadant director fred kopko to testify regarding a memo he sent to cadants board on july   suggesting that the cadant board take into account its fiduciary duties to its shareholders while plaintiff argues that kopkos testimony concerning the memo is admissible to show defendants had notice defendants contend the memo contains legal conclusions and reflects kopkos specialized knowledge of the law lay witnesses may draw on knowledge gained from professional experiences and testify regarding particularized knowledge they gained as employees of a business compania administradora v titan intl inc  fd   th cir  moreover parties are prohibited from extracting expert testimony from lay witnesses in lieu of rule  expert testimony see id at  parties are prevented from proffering an expert in lay witness clothing based on a limited preview of the witness testimony the court accepts that stern ostojic and kopko have room to testify regarding knowledge they gained by virtue of their positions with cadant accordingly the motion is granted in part and denied in part the motion is granted with respect to valuation opinions stern ostojic or kopko testifying about what constitutes delaware or maryland law and opinion testimony as to whether defendant directors breached fiduciary duties however the motion is denied in that mr kopko can explain why he wrote and submitted the memo to the board and testify as to the his understanding at the time regarding what maryland and delaware law provided to the extent he relied upon the understanding to inform his actions  defendants motion to bar testimony about the meaning and application of legal obligations and fiduciary duties defendants also request that lay and expert nonlawyer witnesses be excluded from testifying as to whether defendants conduct complied with fiduciary duties or other legal requirements because such testimony is prohibited under rule  testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact fed r evid a however defendants argue that plaintiffs lay and expert witnesses are poised to offer legal conclusions rather than testimony toward ultimate issues defendants seek to preclude plaintiffs nonlawyer witnesses from testifying regarding compliance with legal standards the witnesses will be permitted to characterize their own conduct but are barred from rendering opinions on the conduct of others plaintiffs witnesses are precluded from rendering opinions on whether others breached fiduciary duty complied with fiduciary obligations or acted in good faith see christiansen v natl savings and trust co  fd   dc cir  lay legal conclusions are inadmissible as evidence  defendants motion to bar admission of the individual defendants compensation employment benefits and indemnification rights defendants move to exclude evidence regarding the monetary distribution or carry that defendants oppenheimer copeland and walker would purportedly receive if their firms investment in cadant was profitable plaintiff concedes it will not present evidence regarding dollar amounts of salaries and employment benefits that the individual defendants received from their employers individual defendants indemnification rights and evidence that the individual defendants received payments from cadant or obtained benefits from the company while defendants argue the alleged carry is irrelevant because cadants performance positive or negative only had the potential for a minuscule and indirect effect on the defendants compensation plaintiff describes the carry as highly relevant toward defendants motivation to breach fiduciary duties under rule b evidence of other crimes wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith it may however be admissible for other purposes such as proof of motive opportunity intent preparation plan knowledge identity or absence of mistake or accident fed r evid b regardless of the net effect the cadant investment had on defendants carry plaintiff claims the carry illustrates the pressure defendants faced to maximize profits and reveals defendants motive to breach fiduciary duties evidence should not be excluded before trial unless it is clearly inadmissible on all potential grounds see kiswani v phoenix sec agency inc  frd   nd ill  although the court is uncertain defendants carry had anything more than an indirect effect on defendants compensation and conduct the evidence is relevant with regard to defendants plausible motive accordingly the motion is denied  defendants motion to bar evidence of defendants size wealth or resources defendants want to limit references to the defendants size wealth revenues profits and resources as irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial unless otherwise stipulated to by the parties while defendants argue references to their size wealth and resources may be irrelevant to the proceedings they do not contest that plaintiff can offer evidence related to defendants investment portfolio industry expertise and reputation in the venture capital industry defendants do oppose evidence of size wealth or revenue that goes toward defendants extensive wealth or deep pockets and the reasonableness of nondefendant cadant founders rather than defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duty plaintiff will offer evidence that cadants founders conducted due diligence and negotiated with several venture capitalists before selecting venrock to lead the series a preferred stock round of financing generally plaintiff intends to highlight defendants size wealth or resources as the reason cadants founders deferred financial authority to defendants plaintiff cites venture associates corp v zenith data systems  wl  at  nd ill apr   to support its position that defendants financial history is relevant in venture the court permitted evidence of the defendants financial history where the reasonableness of the defendants conduct is at issue id in this case plaintiff proposes evidence of defendants financial history for the purpose of establishing the reasonableness of cadants founders who are not parties to this lawsuit relevant evidence is considered that which has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence fed r evid  defendants do not believe the reasonableness of cadants founders makes defendants purported breach of fiduciary duty any more or less probable furthermore defendants are concerned plaintiff will prove up the nonparty cadant founders reasonableness in lieu of proving defendants breach of fiduciary duty defendants motion is granted in part and denied in part the motion is granted in that plaintiff is precluded from mentioning or suggesting that defendants have deep pockets the motion is otherwise denied  defendants motion to bar references to the rockefellers their wealth or their connection to the venrock defendants defendants seek to exclude references to the rockefeller familys relationship with the venrock defendants because the evidence is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial plaintiff argues that evidence of the defendants relationship with the rockefeller family goes toward the reasonableness of cadants founders in selecting the venrock defendants to lead series a financing and that identification of the rockefeller family and rockefeller institutions is necessary to determine bias during the jury selection process relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice confusion of the issue or misleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence fed r evid  in adams laboratories the seventh circuit opined that appealing to the sympathy of jurors through references to defendants relative wealth is improper if the wealth and size of defendant are not at issue in the case see adams laboratories inc v jacobs engineering co inc  fd   th cir  the rockefeller family is not a party to this case and their wealth is not at issue the court fails to see the probative value of rockefeller evidence accordingly the motion is granted  defendants motion to bar references to other corporate scandals or infamous suits such as the enron or worldcom litigation defendants seventh motion in limine seeks to bar references to other corporate scandals or infamous suits defendants cite the enron or worldcom litigations as examples of such corporate scandals sought to be barred defendants argue that such references are not relevant and would be misleading and unduly prejudicial to defendants plaintiff argues defendants seventh motion in limine can be broken into two parts  whether the trustee may introduce evidence of other deals corporate acts both in the regular course of business and those involving corporate wrongdoing in which defendants were involved and  whether the trustee may introduce evidence of other corporate scandals or wrongdoings which do not involve defendants plaintiff further argues  is relevant to the plaintiffs claim of conflict and probative of defendants adherence to industry practices and  is relevant to determine the extent which defendants actions conform or do not conform to realworld industry standards the court finds the introduction of evidence of other corporate scandals or infamous suits is not relevant and even if relevant highly prejudicial sabratek liquidating llc v kpmg llp no  c   wl  nd ill nov   the improper conduct of other firms   has little if any relevance to kpmgs conduct at issue    and the probative value of references to the accounting scandals of the past few years is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice that could be given to such evidence by the jury defendants seventh motion in limine is granted and plaintiff is barred from referencing other corporate scandals or infamous suits  defendants motion in limine to bar evidence of unrelated deals involving venrock associates and venture law group defendants eighth motion in limine seeks to bar evidence of unrelated deals involving venrock associates and venture law group vlg on january   vlg was dismissed from this case with prejudice by judge wedoff defendants argue evidence of unrelated deals involving venrock and vlg are irrelevant and in the alternative prejudicial first defendants argue that evidence of other venrock investments involving vlg is irrelevant and prejudicial second defendants argue evidence of other venrock investments involving vlg would be inadmissible under fre  and third defendants argue evidence of other venrock investments involving vlg would be inadmissible under fre  plaintiff argues that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect fed r evid  plaintiff argues the evidence of deals involving venrock and vlg demonstrate a conflict not only based upon vlg representing venrock portfolio companies but also vlg participating directly in venrock financings of the very companies vlg was asked to represent plaintiff argues that judge wedoffs dismissal upholding an arbitration clause in vlgs retainer agreement was not based on any substantive review of vlgs conduct and occurred prior to discovery plaintiff also argues that the extent of the conflict is important to understanding the issue at hand in this case this court disagrees defendants eighth motion in limine is granted judge wedoff dismissed vlg from this case with prejudice on january   pursuant to an arbitration clause judge wedoff made no findings on the merits vlg is not probative as to whether defendants breached their fiduciary duty or as to whether defendants conspired to engage in selfdealing  defendants motion to bar admission of omnibus categories on plaintiffs exhibit list defendants ninth motion in limine seeks to bar admission of omnibus categories on plaintiffs exhibit list this court will provide some background to this omnibus motion in limine in may  the court ordered parties to submit their joint pretrial orders by august   each party could object to the opposing partys exhibits the opposing party must then provide a response to each objection plaintiffs rendered exhibit list also includes thirtyfour grouped exhibits each a different document in the lawsuit defendants request plaintiffs exhibit list of  group exhibits be stricken defendants argue that plaintiffs grouped exhibits pervert the pretrial process by generalizing discovery documents concealing documents to be used at trial frustrating defendants abilities to object to the documents and precluding this court from determining admissibility this court prefers each party to designate as trial exhibits those exhibits the party affirmatively intends to use in its case in chief exhibits for other purposes — eg used for impeachment purposes—do not need to be identified as trial exhibits prior to trial however those documents must be produced in discovery to avoid surprises defendants motion in limine is granted in the event of later issues the parties may return to this court for assistance  defendants motion to preclude argument that cadants reincorporation under delaware law was fraudulent or otherwise improper defendants seek to preclude plaintiff from arguing that an aspect of the proxy statements—cadants reincorporation from maryland to delaware—was fraudulent or otherwise improper defendants argue judge james f holderman rejected this argument in november —and that the seventh circuit upheld that ruling in kennedy v venrock assocs  fd  th cir  in light of those rulings defendants maintain plaintiff should not have another chance to litigate the issue in response plaintiff charges defendants misstated mischaracterized and failed to fully disclose those holdings defendants argue plaintiff fails to address its cited authorities which show that this court should take judicial notice of the seventh circuits and judge holdermans ruling under rule  of the federal rules of evidence see opoka v ins  fd   th cir  plaintiff maintains the seventh circuit never addressed the issue whether the proxy statement although possibly independent and not deceptive was not part of a scheme to steal corporate assets defendants take issue with plaintiffs contention that the relevant rulings noted above are in dispute urging that both courts found cadants reincorporation under delaware law was not fraudulent this court recently addressed defendants interpretation of kennedy in cdx liquidating trust v venrock associcates  br   nd ill  as this court explained in kennedy according to defendants a group of cadant common shareholders represented by plaintiffs counsel brought direct claims against these same defendants that were nearly identical to the claims in the current action including the claims that cadants board fraudulently decided to reincorporate in maryland and failed to include biographical information in its proxy statement id district judge james f holderman previously dismissed the kennedy complaint because its claims belonged to cadant not to the individual shareholders and the seventh circuit affirmed on that basis and also rejected a number of plaintiffs substantive theories including the theory that jp morgan and venrock had an agreement or conspiracy to control cadant id quoting kennedy  fd at  stating that defendants made no such agreement or conspiracy in addition prior to this time bankruptcy judge eugene r wedoff dismissed nine of the seventeen counts of plaintiffs adversary complaint a number of which were dismissals on the merits including plaintiffs fraud claims as this court found in cdx liquidating trust v venrock associates in the context of bifurcation the court in kennedy specifically addressed the weaknesses in plaintiffs allegations that defendants conspired or were in agreement with one another to control cadant the courts opinion in kennedy along with judge wedoffs concerns regarding how the conspiracy claim was plead demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that plaintiff may not succeed in proving liability for all claims against all defendants cdx liquidating trust  br at  specifically in kennedy the seventh circuit found the key allegation in the complaint against the director defendants is that they submitted a proxy statement to the common stockholders of cadant containing material omissions and misstatements for the purpose of removing control of cadant from the common stockholders     the only removal of control charged is the reincorporation of cadant in delaware which reduced the shareholders control over certain transactions as to that the shareholders could not be deceived because the proxy statement described the consequences of reincorporation at great length all the other charges in the complaint involve injury to the corporation the common shareholders were injured by that injury but that makes their claim against th defendants the injurers indirect and so bars their prosecuting the claim outside of the bankruptcy proceeding kennedy  fd at  emphasis in original defendants next argue plaintiffs suggestion it has never been afforded the opportunity to present arguments and evidence on the claim is disingenuous pointing out that the same lawyers who represent plaintiff represented the kennedy plaintiffs who now comprise the driving force behind the current lawsuit moreover defendants highlight the fact that the same document is at issue—cadants november  proxy statement as discussed above this court agrees indeed the complaints are virtually identical as are the claims and the legal arguments with respect to defendants collateral estoppel argument defendants claim plaintiff creates a straw man instead of addressing the issue first plaintiff allegedly pretends the issue is whether cadants reincorporation under delaware law was part of a scheme to steal corporate assets instead of whether cadants reincorporation under delaware law was fraudulent or otherwise improper as set out above that issue was decided in the negative in kennedy kennedy  fd at    second plaintiff fails to support its claim that the issue was not litigated as a claim need not actually reach trial to be litigated see la preferida inc v cerveceria modelo sa de cv  fd   th cir  ruling on motion to dismiss suffices kunzelman v thompson  fd   th cir  opportunity to brief and argue issue suffices indeed the seventh circuit specifically held the trustees fraudulent reincorporation argument failed on the merits kennedy  fd at  as to the third collateral estoppel factor defendants contend plaintiff concedes by its silence that the seventh circuits determination of the fraudulent reincorporation issue was essential to its ruling in that plaintiff contests only whether the seventh circuit determined among other things whether omissions in the proxy statements of director biographies and whether the proxy statement were part of a scheme to steal corporate assets the seventh circuits determination directly informed its holding that the kennedy plaintiffs could not show special injury so as to save their claims from dismissal see kennedy  fd at  fourth and finally defendants challenge plaintiffs claim that its interests were not fully represented in the earlier action urging plaintiff fails to show any concrete differences between its interests here and its lawyers interests in kennedy defendants claim this is for good reason as the common shareholders are the driving force behind plaintiffs lawsuit and other entities are defendants in this case this court agrees with defendants in sum this court finds it is appropriate to preclude plaintiff from arguing or suggesting at trial that cadants reincorporation from maryland to delaware was fraudulent or otherwise improper thus defendants tenth motion in limine is granted iv
