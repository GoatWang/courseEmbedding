shares being offered in this prospectus the education consulting business in china is rapidly evolving highly fragmented and competitive and we expect competition in this sector to persist and intensify we face competition in each major program we offer and each geographic market in which we operate for example we face competition for our student services from boya international elite company which offers overseas education programs for students from china we face competition from the study abroad foundation for our institutional services which offers advice on attracting international students to universities we face competition from the first abroad organization for our educator placement services which introduce american teachers to china because we cover three major aspects of the education service industry we have several competitors in each of our areas of service however we do not believe that we have competitors who integrate and provide services to cover all three major targeted clients students institutions and educators like our business we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following  provide onestop integrated services to students teachers and institutions  brand recognition and reputation  a service model that aligns personalized services to the specific needs of students and institutions  overall customer satisfaction  size and coverage of service network and proximity of services to customers  scope quality and consistency of service our key competitive strengths lie in our individualized attention to students its ability to place educators at top universities around the globe and in the us and its understanding of the globalization needs of top universities in recruiting both international students and faculty in an ever evolving education landscape we provide a onestop service to students teachers and institutions however some of our existing and potential competitors may have more resources than we do these competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion and sale of their programs services and products and respond more quickly than we can to changes in student demands testing materials admissions standards market needs or new technologies company description american education center inc and subsidiary
