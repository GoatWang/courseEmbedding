opinion of management all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of only normal recurring

by rsi bre� under the terms of the equipment transfer agreement rsg receives  per unit per day of the revenue from the revenue sharing agreements if earned which is applied to the obligation to rsg� the obligation to rsg is being amortized over the remaining life of the revenue sharing agreements using an estimated effective interest rate of approximately � this rate could fluctuate in the future depending upon the level and timing of revenues generated from the refreshment center units � the board of directors of rsi bre is comprised of one appointee from the company one appointee from rsg and one independent appointee all operating decisions including disbursements of rsi bre require unanimous consent of rsi bre�s board of directors as a result the company does not control rsi bre in accordance with eitf  �investor�s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights� the company has determined that rsi bre does not qualify for consolidation in the company�s financial statements rather the company�s investment in rsi bre is reflected as an �investment in wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary� in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting � at march   and december   the assets and liabilities

current liabilities �   longterm liabilities �   � note  � commitments and contingencies � legal matters � on march�  the company received a letter from the company�s former chairman and chief executive officer in which he claims he is due certain severance and other payments in the aggregate amount of approximately  pursuant to the terms of his terminated employment agreement� the matter has been submitted to binding arbitration per the terms of the terminated employment agreement� although the resolution of the claim is not expected to have a material effect on the company�s financial position or future results of operations there is no assurance that the results of the binding arbitration will be favorable to the company� in the event that the arbitrator finds in favor of the former chairman and chief executive officer the company may be exposed to a liability of up to approximately  the amount claimed by the former chairman and chief executive officer� the arbitration hearing scheduled for february  was postponed at the request of the former chairman and chief executive officer and has not been rescheduled � the company is also the subject of certain

exercise of  unvested options the common shares issued upon the early exercise are subject to contingent repurchase call options held by the company that will lapse at the time and to the extent the options vest� the options vest through december   the company may exercise the repurchase call option on the unvested portion of the common shares if the related officer terminates employment with the

exchanged options had been accounted for under fas  and had fair value of  which has been recorded as additional paidin capital � in accordance with fas interpretation no  the company indirectly reduced the fixed exercise price of options to purchase  shares by canceling those options in january  in connection with the tender offer and by granting on december   options to the same persons to purchase  shares at lower exercise prices� as a result the options will be accounted for as variable options until they are exercised forfeited or expire on december   officers and a related entity

report� this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties� our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors discussed elsewhere in this report � certain information included herein contains statements that may be considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended or the securities act and section�e of the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act such as statements relating to our anticipated revenues gross margin and operating results future performance and operations plans for future expansion capital spending sources of liquidity and financing sources� such forwardlooking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and accordingly such results may differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made herein� these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those relating to our liquidity requirements the continued growth of the lodging industry the success of our productdevelopment marketing and sales activities vigorous competition in the lodging industry dependence on existing management leverage and debt service including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates domestic or global economic conditions the inherent uncertainty and costs of prolonged arbitration or litigation and changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws� a complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties are contained in our annual report on form ksb as filed with the securities and exchange commission on april   � overview � eroomsystem technologies inc is a nevada corporation incorporated on august� � we have developed and introduced to the lodging industry an intelligent inroom computerized platform and communications network or the eroomsystem� the eroomsystem is a computerized platform and processorbased system that is installed within our eroomserv refreshment centers and designed to collect and control data� the eroomsystem also supports our eroomsafe an electronic in�room safe� as part of our expanding line of products we announced eroomtray an inroom ambient tray that can sell a wide variety of products at room temperature and eroomenergy an inroom digital thermostat that is designed to control virtually any fan coil unit or packagedterminal air conditioner found in hotel rooms� we also intend to develop other applications and extensions to the eroomsystem including information management services and direct credit card billing and remote engineering and maintenance services � accounting policies � the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures some of which may require revision in future periods� the most sensitive estimates affecting our financial statements include future volatility used in valuing equity instruments allowance for bad debts depreciable lives of refreshment centers in service and property and equipment amortization life of patents deferred maintenance revenue and accrued liabilities� by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty our judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of industry trends information provided by or gathered from our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates� the following is a summary of what management believes are the critical accounting policies related to our operations� the application of �  � these policies in some cases requires our management to make subjective judgments regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain � description of revenues � historically we have received substantially all of our revenues from the sale or placement under a revenuesharing program of our products in hotels� we expect that these revenues will account for a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future� we also generate limited revenues from maintenance and support services� our dependence on the lodging industry makes us vulnerable to downturns in the lodging industry caused by the general economic environment� such a downturn could result in some hotels delaying or declining to purchase or place our products or failing to renew our maintenance agreements or it could result in fewer purchases by hotel guests of goods and services from our products installed in hotels� time spent by individuals on travel and leisure is typically discretionary for consumers and may be particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy� the success of our operations depends in part upon discretionary consumer spending and economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment wages and salaries business conditions interest rates availability of credit and taxation � through our revenuesharing program we install our products at little or no upfront cost to our customers and share in the recurring revenues generated from sales of goods and services related to our products� we retain the ownership of the eroomserv refreshment centers and eroomsafes throughout the term of the revenuesharing agreements and the right to redeploy any systems returned to us upon the expiration or earlier termination of the revenuesharing agreements� we believe that our revenuesharing program will increase future placements of our products however we cannot assure you that we will be successful in this effort � we have experienced substantial fluctuations in revenues from periodtoperiod as a result of limited working capital to fund the development and assembly of our products and to maintain sufficient component inventories� in addition to limited working capital fluctuations in revenues have partially resulted from the transition to our revenuesharing program under which revenues are recognized over the sevenyear life of the contract instead of immediately upon installation of the product� we anticipate that over the next several years the majority of our revenues will result from the placement of our products pursuant to our revenuesharing program followed by sales and to a lesser extent from maintenance agreements� we project that we will receive approximately  of the recurring revenues from the sale of goods and services generated by our eroomserv refreshment centers eroomsafes and eroomtray solutions placed under the revenuesharing agreements� our customers receive the remainder of the recurring revenues� amresco leasing corporation or amresco has agreed to finance up to  of the cost of our products placed under our revenuesharing program subject to the satisfaction of funding requirements and as a result will be paid from our portion of the revenues � revenue recognition � sales revenue from our products is recognized upon completion of installation and acceptance by the customer� sales revenue from the placement of our eroomserv refreshment centers and eroomsafes under our revenuesharing program are accounted for similar to an operating lease with the revenues recognized as earned over the term of the agreement� in some instances our revenuesharing agreements provide for a guaranteed minimum daily payment by the hotel� we negotiate our portion of the revenues generated under our revenuesharing program based upon the cost of the equipment installed and the estimated daily sales per unit for the specific customer� we seek a gross profit margin of  on the sale and placement through our revenuesharing program of eroomserv refreshment centers and eroomsafes � we typically enter into installation maintenance and license agreements with our customers� installation maintenance and license revenues are recognized as the services are performed or pro rata �  � over the service period� we defer all revenue paid in advance relating to future services and products not yet installed and accepted by our customers � description of expenses � cost of product sales consists primarily of production shipping and installation costs� cost of revenuesharing arrangements consists primarily of depreciation of capitalized costs for the products placed in service� we capitalize the production shipping installation and sales commissions related to the eroomserv refreshment centers and eroomsafes placed under revenuesharing agreements� cost of maintenance fee revenues primarily consists of expenses related to customer support and maintenance � selling general and administrative expenses include selling expenses consisting primarily of advertising promotional activities trade shows travel and personnelrelated expenses and general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of professional fees salaries and related costs for accounting administration finance human resources information systems and legal personnel � research and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs for hardware and software engineers quality assurance specialists management personnel and the costs of materials used by these employees in the development of new or enhanced product offerings � in accordance with financial accounting standards board or fasb statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no� �accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed� development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products to be sold leased or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established� internally generated capitalizable software development costs have not been material to date� we have charged our software development costs to research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations � results of operations � comparison of three months ended march   and  � revenues � product sales �� revenues from product sales were  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march   representing a decrease of  or �� the decrease in revenues from product sales was due to reduced sales of our products during the three months

months ended march   representing a decrease of  or � the gross margin percentage on maintenance revenues was  for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march  � the decrease in our cost of maintenance revenue and the reduction in the gross margin deficit percentage were primarily due to the allocation of costs to a greater number of installed units offset in part by onetime repair costs of  associated with a hotel property � the changes and percent changes with respect to our revenues and our cost of revenue for the three months ended march   and  are as follows

exclusive of noncash compensation expense were  for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march   representing a decrease of  or � selling general and administrative expenses represented  of our total revenue for the three months ended march   compared to  of our total revenue for the three months ended march  � the decrease in our selling general and administrative

months ended march   and  for the three months ended march   representing a decrease of  or � research and development expenses represented  of our total revenue for the three months ended march   and  of our total revenue for the three months ended march  � the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to the completion of the research and development for our new windowsbased platform and other products � noncash compensation expense� � noncash compensation expense was  for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march  � the noncash compensation expense recorded for the three months ended march   was due to the variable accounting for stock options issued on december   to certain of our employees of which options to purchase  shares of our common stock remain unexercised and outstanding � other expense net � other expense was  for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march   representing an increase of � the increase was due primarily to the increased interest expenses related to our borrowings pursuant to our financing arrangement with amresco and a decrease in our interest and other income � loss attributable to common stockholders � we incurred losses attributable to common stockholders of  and  during the three months ended march   and  respectively� the  decrease in the loss attributable to common stockholders was due primarily to increased revenue decreased cost of revenue and decreased operating expenses offset in part by increased other expense net� we have continued to incur losses subsequent to march   and as a result have experienced an increase in accumulated deficit� we believe that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future � liquidity and capital resources � during the three months ended march   our principal capital resources were our financial arrangement with amresco and the  in gross proceeds from our private placement of common stock in march � during the fiscal year  we received  in fundings from amresco and anticipate future fundings of up to  during the three months ended june  � the funds from amresco and our private placement have been and will be used to fund working capital and general corporate purposes � at march�  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of  of cash and  of working capital compared to  of cash and  of working capital at december  � in addition our stockholders� equity was  at march�  compared to stockholders� equity of  at december   an increase of � the increase in �  � cash working capital and stockholders� equity reflects the proceeds from our private placement of common stock in march  offset in part by the continued use of cash by our operations and our current inability to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our operations � our accumulated deficit increased from  at march   to  at march� � the increase in accumulated deficit resulted primarily from the net loss from operations for the nine months ended december�  and for the three months ended march� � we anticipate that our accumulated deficit will continue to increase for the foreseeable future � we used net cash of  of net cash used by operating activities during the three months ended march  compared to  in operating activities during the three months ended march  � the  decrease in the use of net cash for operating activities primarily resulted from the  decrease in net loss offset in part by a  decrease in distributions in excess of equity from rsi bre inc a  decrease in net cash received from accounts receivable a  decrease in inventories a  decrease in accounts payable a  decrease in accrued liabilities and a  decrease in customer deposits and deferred maintenance revenue � investing activities for the three months ended march   used net cash of  compared to  provided during the three months ended march  � the increase in net cash provided by investing activities resulted primarily  in� proceeds from payments on notes receivable from stockholders and the  decrease in the purchase of property and equipment and the absence of additions to refreshment centers in service� notwithstanding the increase in net cash provided by investing activities we expect our investing activity to increase in  due to the proposed increase in the placement of our products under our revenuesharing program� additionally we anticipate that we will experience a modest increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments for property and equipment consistent with anticipated growth in operations infrastructure and personnel � financing activities provided  during the three months ended march   compared to net cash of  provided during the three months ended march  � the primary source of cash during the three months ended march   was our private placement of common stock for gross proceeds of � as a result the increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants offset in part by principal payments on notes payable and principal payments on capital lease obligations � the placement of products under revenuesharing arrangements is capital intensive� we estimate that we must place approximately  units pursuant to our revenuesharing program in order to become profitable� as of march�  we had  units placed pursuant to our revenuesharing program� although we received proceeds from our financing arrangement with amresco and in march  from our private placement of common stock we will require additional cash to finance our planned expansion and capital expenditures� the need for additional working capital is due in part to the day seasoning period prior to the receipt of funding from amresco� we are exploring financing alternatives that may include institutional or other lending sources and private placements of debt or equity� there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operations during the day or longer seasoning period or that our customers will meet the minimum performance criteria established by amresco as a prerequisite to receiving any funding from amresco� if we are unsuccessful in obtaining financing to fund operations during the day or longer seasoning period or if we do not receive sufficient financing from amresco we may have to shift more placements of our units from revenuesharing arrangements to product sales� no assurance can be given that we will be able to shift the placement of a sufficient number of our units from revenuesharing arrangements to product sales in order to provide adequate liquidity� based on the foregoing we believe that we will have sufficient cashonhand and cash from future fundings with amresco to sustain our routine business operations excluding capital expenditures to meet our planned expansion through the third quarter of �  � � in addition although we expect to raise additional funds for working capital through private offerings of our equity or convertible debt securities we have no assurance that adequate funds will be available on terms favorable to us or at all� further although we presently intend to conduct a private placement of common stock towards the end of the second quarter of  if market conditions permit the realization of additional financing is not assured� these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern � contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments � the following

as of this date � � � payments due by period � contractual cash obligations � total �   year �  years �  years �   years � longterm debt �   �   �   �   �   � capital lease obligations �  �  � � � � �

sharing agreements which is applied to the obligation incurred by rsi bre inc our whollyowned unconsolidated subsidiary � recent downturns in the airline travel and lodging industries � due to the weakening economy and the events of september   the travel and lodging industries have experienced unprecedented downturns� more specifically the lodging industry has experienced lower hotel occupancy rates due to reduced business and leisure travel� since the success of our business is directly linked to the performance of the travel and lodging industries the substantial layoffs in these industries the postponement of future hotel renovations and projects the substantial dropoff in guest occupancy and the dramatic reduction in business and leisure travel including convention traffic have hurt our ability to finalize contracts with hotel properties with which we have been meeting and negotiating� in this regard there is no assurance that we will be able to close contracts with our current potential customers or that we will be successful in starting discussions with other hotel properties � qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk � our products require a limited amount of assembly at our facility in the united states� we purchase refrigerators from suppliers in the united states canada and china on a purchase order basis in us dollars� all other components for our products are purchased from suppliers based in the united states� our products are primarily marketed in the united states but we eventually intend to further expand our marketing to the international lodging market and to other industries domestically and internationally� as a result our financial results could be affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets� because all of our revenues will be denominated in us dollars a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets � as we expand operations internationally we will continue to evaluate our foreign currency exposures and risks and develop appropriate hedging or other strategies to manage those risks� we have not revised our current business practices to conform to europe�s conversion to the euro �  � part ii � other information � item � legal proceedings � not applicable � item � changes in securities and use of proceeds � unregistered issuance of
