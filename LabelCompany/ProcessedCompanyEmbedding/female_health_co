lastfinancierapril    am edt share on female health co nasdaqfhco is a buy with a  months target price of  investors should assign a higher multiple as company moves away from lumpy revenue streams as fhco diversifies product pipeline their valuation multiples should rise from government sector norms xx to being valued as a consumer business xx company is preparing to target us female consumers by launching an active sales and marketing campaign within the next  quarters valuation lrad corp and taser inc were primarily chosen as a comparison to the female health company because both companies generate cashflow by dealing with government agencies directly just like fhco the next products purchase should logically be in the female reproductive health space and go in conjunction with the fc this is what will really take the valuation and multiples to a new level legacy business model and its issue female health company fhco manufactures and sells the only approved fda and who female condom fc on the market the company has its female condom patented in over  countries and the fc design is trademarked the company manufactures the female condom in malaysia for  cents and sells its roughly  to  cents to its  main nongovernment and government clients unfpa usaid semina brazil sekunjalo south africa the company’s business model has historically been building relationships with health ministries local channels and medical equipmentdevice distributors  the company’s product has been distributed in over  countries and growing the significant demand for the fc comes from developing nations in particular the african continent the amount of condoms sold on a yearly basis fluctuates due to the nature of the order sizes millions of units whether the company continues to win government tenders and often the political climate of the client country the order sizes and consistency of orders are not always the same on a yearly basis therefore revenue may seem choppy from year to year regardless of that fact the company has been profitable and cashflow positive since  and is currently debt free why investors are discounting fhco the female health company is a highly undervalued opportunity which has been precipitously oversold for about a year now the current trading price is roughly in the range of  to  this is well off the  plus range this stock was trading a year ago and more than  less than the  the stock was trading at when the company announced it would no longer pay out its quarterly dividend on july th  most investors are highly sceptical when a small cap company suddenly stops paying dividends after paying them for  years straight the second reason why most investors have discounted the company is because the company artificially inflated net income and earnings per share by bringing down the net operating losses with the use of the valuation allowance the nol was brought down at the end of  this massive discount to fair value of the stock price is a huge buying opportunity for several reasons nothing in the core revenue generating operations has changed the company is still selling millions of condoms in fact on april nd  the company announced record fy  second quarter sales of  million female condoms the company’s management though owned up to the fact that they are essentially a one trick pony selling a single product in the market overall if the company would have continued on the same strategic path this would have worked out great and the fc would act as a cash cow for at least a few years the female health company has first mover advantage in the female condom market the company does face some competition from a publicly traded indian company cupid ltd which manufactures latex female condoms approved by the who the fc is made of nitrile cupid’s market cap is roughly  million usd and its’ product has not been up to par to satisfy stringent tender requirements tests and regulations demanded by large buyers such as the brazilian health ministry there are a few other chinese competitors potentially entering the female condom space but for now they are a nonthreat strategic shifts that will drive the turnaround the company’s management has outlined several strategic initiatives to keep an edge over its competition in the market the company is creating a framework to access and target the average consumer in the us and to acquire an additional products in the female health wellness or infection prevention space to go with the fc essentially the company said we need to grow and expand our revenue in order to be competitive and profitable in the long run the management of this company is definitely forward looking and progressive in its vision for the company now the investor can see that in order to grow and expand the company needs money for ma activity and for sales marketing education and advertising the first step in initiating a more consumer oriented growth plan for the us has been taken by making the condom available directly through the company’s website customers are required to buy at least  packs of  condoms each at  per condom plus shipping only to the us the female condom is reimbursable under the affordable care act if prescribed by an innetwork doctor and covered by most major health plans administered by unitedhealthcare aetna humana kaiser and cigna the fc becomes a viable and safe alternative for women who cannot or do not want to go on the hormonal pill for women in their ’s and ’s who have been taking hormones for years and for women who are fertility challenged the way the company plans to accomplish this is by initiating a social and digital campaign which is expected to be launched within the next to  quarters the company has said that it plans create greater product awareness and support by targeting  obstetriciangynaecologist obgyn practices who write most of the prescriptions in the united states these practices will be given samples of the fc to then give to the women  this would be a logical approach to a continuous new long term cashflow for the company the significance of sales marketing  advertising the latest company presentation and conference call heavily focused on sales marketing and distribution this is an obvious sign that the company is trying to get the word out about its condoms some of the money that was set aside for paying the dividend has been directed towards the sales and marketing budget and ma activity according to management most of the money that was set aside for educating women in current consumer countries will be transferred for the upcoming sales and marketing campaign the current customers’ countries strategy will be changed to a more traditional sales and marketing approach in effect we may see some new expenses pop up but the company as a whole is very cost conscious and has set up an advisory board on how to efficiently target the us female consumer the company has recently hired  sales and marketing experts and have signed on new distributors the company has also mentioned that they plan to invest more into brand management and into actual packaging of the company the fc can be purchased online on amazon at selected condom stores online at walgreens but not at walmart or cvs a crucial strength that the female company possesses is its invaluable relationships channels distributors and reach all over the world these relationships are the bloodline of this company the next jump that this company will be making is crucial to its success the company has been actively seeking a products technology or an acquisition to add to their domain effectively adding another cashflow stream to boost growth as of the last annual meeting on march th  the company has clearly stated that they have evaluated over  productscompanies they are negotiating with top targets and there will be an acquisition in calendar  the company is looking for a complementary products to its condom – mainly in the female reproductive infection prevention and intimate health space the addition and launching of a new products can be leveraged via the company’s incredible network of distributors channels and relationships throughout the world this is the golden key to success growth and higher cashflows for the future of this company financing would more than likely be required for these acquisitions through either long term debt andor issuing additional shares new management new direction new company for the past  months the company has gone through a targeted hiring of key personnel a few of the oldtimers have resigned from the board of directors it’s also worth mentioning that the company is heavily owned by management and several institutions to start off the current ceo karen king was hired january  has worked  years in the healthcare industry is a marketing sales and development specialist and was president of dsm’s biopharmaceutical business susan ostrowski was hired in june  as an executive vice president of new business development and will be responsible for the company’s sales marketing and sales support functions and will
