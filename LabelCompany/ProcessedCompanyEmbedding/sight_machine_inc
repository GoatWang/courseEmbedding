open and agnostic data platform it can support multiple data sources from across your infrastructure including plc endpoints inspection systems and quality equipment excel spreadsheets data historian output rdbms mes and erp adapters and mtconnect agents the platform’s plugin architecture enables us to develop custom adapters to fit additional data sourcesformats to ensure that all necessary information can be seamlessly collected how is data collected and consolidated into the sight machine platform sight machine’s data collection process includes three steps data acquisition from multiple sources across the factory floor data transformation into the api formats required data upload to our management layer in an onfloor cluster or the cloud how is the data collection process managed – and will sight machine need to install any physical hardware on premise there are multiple data configuration options data is collected and pushed to the cloud this option is recommended when there are limited needs for realtime data access a central plant cluster communicates directly with machines offering modest realtime data accessibility a data collection node is installed next to the edge devices for collection and preprocessing offering a realtime look into the performance operations of facility machines what happens to data collection processing and access when internet service is latent faulty or down when internet service to a plant is interrupted sight machine continues to collect and spool data once the connection is restored the dashboards are updated any closedloop or onpremise functionality will continue to function even without cloud connectivity how quickly can data be collected and consolidated into digestible information for facility managers to review sight machine is configured to handle data as fast as you need it the platform was developed to provide realtime feedback so operations managers can identify and resolve any inefficiencies across the floor as soon as they occur with addon functionality processed at the edge with subsecond response times and kpis aggregated in microbatches of  seconds information can be consolidated and ready for analysis quickly does sight machine deliver supplychainwide visibility yes because sight machine supports multiple geographically dispersed data sources from across your infrastructure you’re not limited to singleplant views and can uncover and deliver insights from across the entire supply chain can we manage all of our data locally or do we need to use the cloud we understand that securing private information is a priority for most facilities sight machine offers customers the option to configure their platform to run in a private cloud additionally sight machine offers and maintains a provisioned virtual private cloud in order to provide added security can we export data from sight machine back into another format or system sight machine doesn’t just collect data from a variety of data sources the platform can also push back highlevel data into a variety of standard formats and systems including sql databases data lakes csv files and meserp what types of kpis do you support sight machine offers a variety of kpis including uptime oee performance quality top defect types top downtime reasons average cycle time etc what insight does sight machine provide that i don’t already have access to today by sorting through and making sense of previously unviewed data sight machine helps you gain a faster more accurate view of root cause analysis statistical process control anomaly detection and other resource and timerelated issues does sight machine provide alerts when specific criteria are met yes sight machine’s alert utility provides configuration tolerances for part measurements and machine data how does sight machine keep my data secure sight machine understands that security is a priority and data security is top of mind for us we’ve taken many steps to ensure that all plant floor data collected remains private including all endpoints are on a secure vpn all changes inside the web interface are logged to create an audit trail password and authentication management can be made to comply with your it policies to ensure consistency and avoid added work for your it teams what preparation is required before implementing sight machine getting started with sight machine is straightforward and does not require a vast amount of time or human resources we begin by working with you to identify a potential list of specific projects gain an understanding of the data sources we’ll be working with – including machines databases and systems confirm the goals and specific information that stakeholders – executives operations managers and qa professionals – require who owns the data that is collected into the sight machine systems you own all the data if for any reason you discontinue working with sight machine you can export all of your data and sight machine will no longer have access to any of your company’s information do we need to write custom software in order to work with sight machine no sight machine requires no additional software development for a fully functioning solution unlike other iot platforms sight machine is an endtoend solution that runs off of your existing systems and software what is the average project timeline from start to finish our goal is to get sight machine up and running so you can gain access to your plant floor as soon as possible while project complexity can vary our target for initial deployment is typically  days does sight machine require factory downtime for setup no because sight machine lives downstream from control systems and mes platforms integrations can typically be done without interruption to plant operations what resources are required to manage a project client resources usually include a manufacturing point of contact and and it point of contact their responsibilities are primarily during setup and would only be to facilitate troubleshooting sight machine provides you with a relationship manager and an application engineer while other sight machine resources may be used during deployment once the system is up and running these are your primary contact points for business and technical matters what is it’s role in supporting sight machine after it’s deployed sight machine has a very low it burden and postdeployment support is limited to maintaining network connectivity to the scout and sentinel appliances and giving access to any new
