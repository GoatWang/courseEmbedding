brown and kathleen m eisenhardt the art of continuous change linking complexity theory and timepaced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations administrative science quarterly   in contrast to the punctuated equilibrium model of change this inductive study of multipleproduct innovation in six firms in the computer industry examines how organizations engage in continuous change comparisons of successful and lesssuccessful firms show first that successful multipleproduct innovation blends limited structure around responsibilities and priorities with extensive communication and design freedom to create improvisation within current projects this combination is neither so structured that change cannot occur nor so unstructured that chaos ensues second successful firms rely on a wide variety of lowcost probes into the future including experimental products futurists and strategic alliances neither planning nor reacting is as effective third successful firms link the present and future together through rhythmic timepaced transition processes we develop the ideas of semistructures links in time and sequenced steps to crystallize the key properties of these continuously changing organizations and to extend thinking about complexity theory timepaced evolution and the nature of core capabilities p  abstract competing on the edge edit shona l brown and kathleen m eisenhardt  competing on the edge strategy as structured chaos boston harvard business school press complexity theory began with an interest u how order spring from chaos according to complexity theory adaption is most effective in systems that are only partially connected the argument is that too much structure creates gridlock while too little structure creates chaos a good example would be the traffic lights in a city if there are no lights traffic is chaotic if there are too many lights traffic stops a moderate number of lights creates structure but still allows drivers to adapt their routes in surprising ways in response to changing traffic conditions consequently the key to effective change is to stay poised on this edge of chaos complexity theory focuses managerial thinking on the interrelationships among different parts of an organization and on the tradeoff of less control for greater adaptation p  although the behavior that emerges is complex the rules that guide it are necessarily simple in fact it is their simplicity that creates the freedom to behave in complicated adaptive and surprising ways p  coadaptation is the process whereby systems of related agents take mutual advantage of each other in order to change more effectively yet still be adaptive in each agents particular situation p  in our work in fast changing markets we often see that time pacing helps managers avert the danger of changing too infrequently by setting a regular pace for change managers avoid becoming locked into old patterns and habits p  managers who extensively plan the future get the timing wrong sometimes they arrive to market too early and so must wait for the demand to catch up sometimes they are too late and so must accelerate to rejoin the future p  external linksedit

entrepreneurial leadership historical research reference in entrepreneurship posted  nov    shona l brown affiliation not provided to ssrnkathleen m eisenhardt stanford university  management science  engineering date written  abstract this review of the state of research on product development as of the mids finds that it is quite fragmented and sets out to create a framework by which to view the literature most empirical research can be grouped into three views of the nature of the product development process rational plan communication web or disciplined problem solving based on the prior research a model of success factors is developed which highlights the value of various stakeholders or agents and distinguishes between success in the process and a successful product the focus on product development as successful when rationally planned identified the value of organizational characteristics such as crossfunctional teams and product champions and the importance of market conditions research on the role of communication within the product development team and externally focused on the importance of a communication strategy and the need for gatekeepers and boundary spanners on the team the disciplined problem solving approach emerged first in studies of japanese product development processes this approach requires strong leadership and a clear vision with a clear goal in mind and input from various functions there is also autonomy to experiment going through multiple problem solving iterations these research streams overlap and from that commonality a model is developed herein that emphasizes the importance of such factors as crossfunctional teams strong leadership resource availability and information flow three issues for future product development research are  the role of senior managers  the organization of work eg improvision vs planning and  the connections and dependencies between the development process market factors effective products and financial performance keywords organizational planning gatekeepers champions boundary spanning communication patterns communication strategies information flow organizational

elbaum associates inc   patching  restitching business portfolios in dynamic markets harvard business review eisenhardt k m brown s l     abstract in turbulent markets businesses and opportunities are constantly falling out of alignment new technologies and emerging markets create fresh opportunities converging markets produce more and of course some markets fade in this landscape of continuous flux its more important to build corporatelevel strategic processes that enable dynamic repositioning than it is to build any particular defensible position thats why smart corporate strategists use patching a process of mapping and remapping business units to create a shifting mix of highly focused tightly aligned businesses that can respond to changing market opportunities patching is not just another name for reorganizing patchers have a distinctive mindset traditional managers see structure as stable patching managers believe structure is inherently temporary traditional managers set corporate strategy first but patching managers keep the organization focused on the right set of business opportunities and let strategy emerge from individual businesses although the focus of patching is flexibility the process itself follows a pattern patching changes are usually small in scale and made frequently patching should be done quickly the emphasis is on getting the patch about right and fixing problems later patches should have a test drive before theyre formalized but then be tightly scripted after theyve been announced and patching wont work without the right infrastructure modular business units finegrained and complete unitlevel metrics and companywide compensation parity the authors illustrate how patching works and point out some common stumbling

business school press   time pacing competing in markets that wont stand still harvard business review eisenhardt k m brown s l     abstract most companies change in reaction to events such as moves by the competition shifts in technology or new customer demands in fairly stable markets event pacing is an effective way to deal with change but successful companies in rapidly changing intensely competitive industries take a different approach they change proactively through regular deadlines the authors call this strategy time pacing like a metronome time pacing creates a rhythm to which managers can synchronize the speed and intensity of their efforts for example m dictates that  of its revenues every year will come from new products netscape introduces a new product about every six months and intel adds a new fabrication facility to its operations approximately every nine months time pacing creates a relentless sense of urgency around meeting deadlines and concentrates people on a common set of goals its predictability also provides people with a sense of control in otherwise chaotic markets the authors show how companies such as banc one cisco systems dell computer emerson electric gillette intel netscape shiseido and sony implement the two essentials of time pacing the first is managing transitionsthe shift for example from one newproductdevelopment project to the next the second is setting the right rhythm for change companies that march to the rhythm of time pacing build momentum and companies that effectively manage transitions sustain that momentum without

tushman m harvard business school press   how management teams can have a good fight harvard business review eisenhardt k m kahwajy j l bourgeois l j     abstract toplevel managers know that conflict over issues is natural and even necessary management teams that challenge one anothers thinking develop a more complete understanding of their choices create a richer range of options and make better decisions but the challengefamiliar to anyone who has ever been part of a management teamis to keep constructive conflict over issues from degenerating into interpersonal conflict from their research on the interplay of conflict politics and speed in the decisionmaking process of management teams the authors have distilled a set of six tactics characteristic of highperforming teams they work with more rather than less information they develop multiple alternatives to enrich debate the establish common goals they make an effort to inject humor into the workplace they maintain a balanced corporate power structure they resolve issues without forcing a consensus these tactics work because they keep conflict focused on issues foster collaborative rather than competitive relations among team members and create a sense of fairness in the decisionmaking process without conflict groups lose their effectiveness managers often become withdrawn and only superficially harmonious the alternative to conflict is not usually agreement but rather apathy and disengagement which open the doors to a primary cause of major corporate debacles groupthink view details for web of science id

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
