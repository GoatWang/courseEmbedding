letter from the chairman we believe that we can help equip the rising generation with the skills needed to thrive in the st century there is no question our highly connected world offers powerful tools real opportunities and unprecedented challenges “intelligence is the ability to adapt to change” stephen hawking to all colleagues and friends fifteen years into the st century we still speculate about how our world will change issues evolving at a rapid pace include technology the economy speed and channels of communication personal privacy public safety and which skills will be in highest demand there is no doubt that these and many more fundamental issues will be drastically different when we enter the nd century so what is the best way to prepare and equip the rising generation to thrive in a connected fastchanging and complex world this question is at the heart of sce’s work we manage three strategic grantmaking programs all intended to help prepare today’s kids to be able productive and fulfilled members of society our digital learning program attempts to connect and capitalize on some of the powerful tools and some of the chronic flaws that exist today we begin with the unpleasant fact that our public education system is broken in many ways we are hardly alone in assuming our public education system has devolved into a class system  sadly the quality of education is all too often dependent on family income those with the least resources receive the poorest quality education and vice versa today’s technology—paired with the right human supports—offers  an opportunity to channel highquality learning material to kids anytime anywhere the question then becomes “what is the good” in technology and how can we use it to participate in the effort to democratize education  our highly selective list of grantees illustrates how we are working towards this end our second program area speaks to the “noncognitive” skills that are most highly correlated to life success and satisfaction  the attributes we focus on include grit and resilience problemsolving emotion management agency and capacity for empathy these sel social and emotional learning skills form the framework for meaningful relationships without them even the brightest individual can be limited a significant body of research confirms that sel skills are learned these attributes are usually taught by supportive adults in safe contexts unfortunately many children lack close supportive relationships with adults and there is a paucity of safe places to go on weekends and between dismissal and dinnertime our sel challenge focuses on afterschool programs—in arts sports every conceivable interest area—where lowincome kids and professional youth workers come into frequent contact  we have selected eight geographically and programmatically diverse organizations whose common characteristics include great track records highquality programs and staff and an intentional effort to impart sel skills in addition to providing direct support to some of our nation’s best youthfacing programs we are studying recording and codifying those practices that cultivate sel skills in youth this twoyear effort will culminate in the creation of a field guide of best practices and userfriendly impact measures which will be made available free of charge to any youth service interested in strengthening the sel component of their work and finally we operate a catchall program called catalyst grants which recognizes innovative and promising approaches to chronic problems the list of grantees best describes the work this kind of work is a privilege and a joy sce could not operate without its knowledgeable dedicated board and its keenly intelligent and capable team none of this work would be possible without the generosity of henry crown who believed as i do that actions always speak louder than words susan crown read more our mission sce is invested in shaping an ecosystem of anytime anywhere st century learning to prepare youth to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing and highly connected world through three primary programs—digital learning social and emotional learning and our catalyst grants—sce connects talent and innovation with forces for positive change we seek to broaden the definition of success to include mastery of skills like problem solving complex systems thinking and digital literacy which extend beyond the acquisition of knowledge –to learning how to learn watch a video about our work here our history in  after three decades in traditional philanthropy susan crown decided to pursue a more finely tuned strategic approach to social investment she wanted to focus on a handful of programs and to take bigger risks on innovative ways to drive positive change for the rising generation so she built an entity that is different and nimbler than traditional foundations susan assembled a talented and unconventional staff and a board of experienced leaders from the public private and social sectors the result is sce — the susan crown exchange a social investment organization with a fresh approach to catalyzing change through philanthropy our team susan crown chairman  founder susan crown is a philanthropist and business executive with a strategic resultsoriented approach she is chairman and founder of the susan crown exchange sce and chairman and ceo of owl creek partners unlike most foundations the exchange uses an approach that goes beyond traditional grantmaking it fosters partnerships and collaborations to create social change sce’s mission is to help people acquire skills needed to succeed and thrive in a rapidly changing highly connected world sce is focused on two program areas digital learning and social and emotional learning building grit empathy and emotion management the exchange intends to add programs to cultivate other st century skills sce is a leader in promoting social and emotional skills in  sce published “preparing youth to thrive promising practices in social and emotional learning” the first field guide for organizations aspiring to foster social and emotional growth in young people the content was collected from experts of exemplary programs across the nation – and it is the first best practices field guide of its kind which can be downloaded at no charge from selpracticesorg in the digital learning arena sce partnered with common sense media to develop the rubric for a learning ratings system sce and common sense media have rated more than  digital learning products the system informs parents educators and others about the educational value of a specific digital product and what style learner might benefit most from its use owl creek partners is
