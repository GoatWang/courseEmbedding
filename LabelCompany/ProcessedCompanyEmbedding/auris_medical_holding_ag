hearing loss or  much more frequently  to damage to the hair cells and neurons in the cochlea or to the auditory nerve sensorineural hearing loss hearing loss may develop slowly over many years or set in acutely eg following some noise or head trauma or due to some ototoxic medication eg certain chemotherapy drugs or antibiotics sometimes the precise origin of acute hearing loss is unknown or may only be suspected such as case of idiopathic sudden deafness here the source may be some infection disruption in blood supply or autoimmune disorder while sensorineural hearing loss in the chronic stage is irreversible all or part of it may recover in the acute stage thanks to cochlear repair mechanisms the more severe the acute hearing loss is the less likely spontaneous recovery becomes and the higher the risk for permanent damage and loss is usually hearing recovery is most pronounced in the hours and days following the onset of acute hearing loss and tapering off over  to  weeks in human beings loss of cochlear hair cells or neurons is irreversible chronic hearing loss may have serious impacts on professional and personal lives eg through reduced job performance and earning power impaired memory and ability to learn new tasks or reduced alertness and increased risk to personal safety loss of monitoring of environmental warning sounds     sudden hearing loss physician and

the treatment of acute inner ear tinnitusauris medical is developing keyzilen® for the treatment of acute inner ear peripheral tinnitus following traumatic cochlear injury or otitis media middle ear infection keyzilen® contains esketamine hydrochloride an nmethyldaspartate nmda receptor antagonist formulated in a biocompatible and fully biodegradable gel it is administered in one treatment cycle comprising three intratympanic injections over  to  days into the middle ear from there the drug diffuses through the socalled round window membrane into the cochleakeyzilen® has the potential to be the first drug to gain approval for treating acute inner ear tinnitus how keyzilen® worksacoustic trauma and other insults to the inner ear may trigger increased levels of extracellular glutamate which in turn cause excessive activation of cochlear nmda receptors this process results in damage or killing of sensory cells and is thought to be responsible for abnormal spontaneous firing of auditory nerves which may be perceived as tinnitus under normal circumstances the nmda receptors are thought to play no role in fast excitatory neurotransmission respectively normal hearing keyzilen® is blocking cochlear nmda receptors to suppress the aberrant excitation of the auditory nerve that is perceived as tinnitus development stage keyzilen® is currently in phase  clinical
