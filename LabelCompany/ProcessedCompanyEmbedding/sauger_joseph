fisheries supervisor trilakes fisheries station  north fish hatchery road columbia city indiana  email ghudsondnrstateinus introduction although walleye are thought to be native to indiana distribution was limited one of the earliest recorded stockings was made in  and during the s  to  million fry were stocked annually modern day management began with the resumption of walleye stocking in  today indianas fisheries section annually stocks  impoundments six natural lakes and two rivers with walleye or hybrid walleye table  total acres stocked with walleye or hybrid walleye is  natural reproduction is very limited and contributes little to walleye fishing in the state fisheries biologists have focused on providing fishing opportunities for this popular fish throughout the state increasing sizes and numbers of walleye caught and improving angler satisfaction with walleye fishing brookville reservoir brookville provides some of indianas best walleye fishing walleye harvest documented through creel surveys conducted before the  inch minimum length limit was put in place ranged from  per year to  and averaged nearly  per year most harvested walleye were  inches long but some  inch walleye were occasionally caught in  fewer walleye were caught but they were a little larger averaging  inches the number of walleye harvested was  and  were caught and released the  inch size limit and weak year classes since  are reasons for smaller catches in  annual fry stockings have exceeded  million for  consecutive years brookville is a acre flood control reservoir located in franklin and union counties on highway  approximately  miles south of richmond and  miles northwest of cincinnati a fee is charged to launch boats but there are no restrictions on outboard motor size monroe reservoir monroe has developed into one of the best walleye fisheries in the state in   walleye were harvested and  more were caught and released average length was  inches while the largest walleye harvested indianas walleye record  lbs  oz was set in the s and it is shared by two anglers one of the recordsetters came from the kankakee river the other from the tippecanoe river measured ˝ inches long over  pounds of walleye were harvested as expected catch and harvest numbers were lower in  with the  inch size limit in place fishing was still good as  walleye were harvested and  were caught and released average length of harvested walleye was  inches the largest walleye measured by the creel clerk was  inches about  of the anglers fishing monroe fish for walleye the reservoir has been stocked with ˝ inch long fingerlings the past  years at a density averaging  per acre monroe the states largest reservoir at  acres is accessible from state roads   and  it is located in brown and monroe counties about  miles south of indianapolis and  miles southeast of bloomington there is a fee to launch boats but there is no limit on outboard motor size cagles mill reservoir this acre flood control reservoir located in putnam and owen counties off i about halfway between indianapolis and terre haute has been stocked with   million fry  consecutive years  to

fisheries biologists to change the stocking strategy from hybrid walleye to walleye starting in  kokomo has been stocked each year with walleye fingerlings at  per acre the most recent measure of fish harvest was in  when a seven month long creel survey was conducted an estimated  hybrid walleye were harvested and  were caught and released average length was  inches and highest harvest occurred in

minimum length limit walleye harvest totaled  with an additional  caught and released these fish ranged in length from to  inches and averaged  inches twelve species were observed in the catches and walleye ranked number one by weight over half of the walleye harvested were  inches or longer walleye harvest was highest at clear lake in july followed by august lake maxinkuckee maxinkuckee the states second largest natural lake at  acres is located at the town of culver near state roads  and  in marshall county public access is free but parking spaces are limited outboard motors are permitted maxinkuckee has been stocked with ˝ inch fingerlings acre the last  years  through  fewer walleyes were harvested in   compared to   but that was expected as small fish were protected by the  inch minimum length limit however average size of harvested walleye  inches was the largest documented in six years of measuring angler catches in addition to the number of walleye harvested  were caught and released walleye were targeted by  of the anglers interviewed this popular species comprised  of the harvest by number and ranked second to bluegill  of the anglers interviewed supported the  inch size limit bill lavigne well known natural lake angler with a  lb  oz walleye bass lake a ˝ month long creel survey was conducted from midapril through october  anglers harvested  walleye and caught and released  walleye made up  of the harvest by number and  by weight july was the best month for catching walleye at bass lake most of the walleyes harvested were small averaging  inches  of bass lakes anglers targeted walleye the lake has been stocked with fry  of the past  years no walleye were stocked in  in an effort to reduce food competition and improve growth rates stocking density has also been reduced from  fry per acre to  this shallow acre natural lake is located about six miles south of knox off us  and state road  in starke county there is a public access site on the lake and outboard motors are permitted pike lake the lake was originally stocked with hybrid walleye at about  per acre and good fishing developed starting in  ˝ inch long walleye fingerlings were stocked instead of hybrids to see if they would provide the same level of fishing as the hybrids the  creel survey was conducted aprilseptember eight species were harvested and walleye ranked second  an additional  walleye were caught and released and highest catches occurred in april and may average size of harvested walleye was  inches thirtyone percent of the anglers interviewed fished for walleye and   of them supported the size limit t his   acre natural lake is located within the city limits of warsaw in kosciusko county the lake is open to public fishing and outboard motors are permitted andrew snow biologist aide with a large walleye netted at sylvan lake sullivan lake this acre impoundment is located in sullivan county east of sullivan indiana there is a small fee charged for access and outboard motors are permitted a relatively large population of hybrid walleye developed at sullivan following  consecutive years of stocking fingerlings a  creel survey documented the harvest of  hybrid walleye at sullivan lake  per acre that averaged ˝ inches in length starting in  sullivan lake was stocked with walleye instead of hybrids to see if walleye could provide the same high quality fishing that the hybrids provided after fours years of stocking walleye fingerlings a creel survey was conducted to evaluate the fishery only  walleye were harvested in  compared to  hybrid walleye in  not only were fewer fish harvested they averaged two inches smaller than the hybrids did in  in an effort to turn the fishery around biologists went back to stocking hybrid walleye starting in  about  fingerlings have been stocked each of the last four years  in  the  inch minimum size limit was put in place to protect small hybrids from harvest a creel survey is planned for  to evaluate the sullivan lake hybrid walleye fishery pretty lake this small natural lake  acres has been stocked with walleye fingerlings  consecutive years at acre one hundred fifty walleye ranging from ˝   inches in length were harvested during a midapril through september creel survey in  an additional  walleye were caught and released the  inch size limit was only in place for about one month of the survey average length of harvested walleye was  inches harvest was highest in june and july eleven percent of the anglers were fishing specifically for walleye and another  fished for walleye in combination with another species take state road  about three miles north of south milford then go east on cr  s to reach pretty lake the public access site is located on the southwest side of the lake there is no charge to launch boats but there is a  mph speed limit on pretty lake huntingburg lake huntingburg lake is a acre impoundment located about two miles west of the town of huntingburg on state road  the lake has been stocked with hybrid walleye saugeye fingerlings  of the past  years at  or more per acre during a seven month creel survey in  anglers harvested  saugeye that averaged  inches in length they caught and released  the largest saugeye taken from huntingburg weighed over  pounds five percent of the anglers interviewed during the creel survey fished for saugeye lakeofthewoods lakeofthewoods located southwest of bremen in marshall county is a  acre natural lake a stateowned public access site is located on the southwest shore there is no fee to launch boats and outboard motors are permitted a creel survey was conducted april through september  to evaluate the walleye fishery the lake had been stocked with ˝ inch long walleye fingerlings nine consecutive years  walleye ranked third in the anglers catches behind white bass and crappie walleye  comprised  of the total fish harvest  walleye were harvested and  were caught  and released highest harvest occurred in april but april may and june were good months for catch and release fishing  of the anglers interviewed were fishing for walleye and  supported the  inch size limit eagle creek reservoir prairie creek reservoir and summit lake walleye fisheries at these three impoundments are in the developingstage eagle creek has been stocked six consecutive years mostly with fry summit lake four years mostly with ˝ inch long fingerlings and prairie creek two years with fingerlings based on fall youngoftheyear and fish community survey  catches fishable walleye populations are developing at each of these waters eagle creek is a  acre water supply impoundment northwest of indianapolis prairie creek is a  acre water supply for the city of muncie and summit lake is a  acre impoundment in summit lake state park north of new castle tailwater fishing outstanding walleye fishing has developed below the dams at monroe cagles mill salamonie and mississinewa reservoirs and freeman lake large concentrations of walleye occur at the tailwaters from march into may depending on seasonal water temperatures and flows most of the fish are  inches long but some up to  inches long have been observed the tailwaters provide anglers who dont have a boat a good opportunity to catch walleye some of the largest walleye caught in indiana each year come from tailwaters mississinewa and salamonie tailwaters anglers caught  walleye at the mississinewa tailwater in april and may  they ranged in length from  inches average length was  inches at the salamonie tailwater the catch consisted of  walleye ranging in length from ˝ inches these fish averaged  inches  of the anglers interviewed supported the  inch size limit river walleye indianas fishery biologists believe there are few potential walleye lakes remaining in the state most lakes thought to be capable of providing walleye fishing have already been stocked and evaluated although walleye fishing in natural lakes and impoundments may be improved in the future through changes in fishing regulations and stocking strategies rivers may represent the best opportunities to significantly increase walleye fishing in the hoosier state stocking has produced good walleye fishing in two impoundments on the st joseph river the impoundment above the elkhart dam has been stocked with ˝ inch long fingerlings eight consecutive years  in  during the early years of the fishery anglers harvested  walleye averaging  inches in length from the impoundment an additional  walleye were caught and released may was the best month to catch walleye in the impoundment fishing was also good in the tailwater below elkhart dam where  walleye were harvested and  were caught and released  of walleye harvest at the tailwater occurred in april in  walleye again ranked first in the anglers catches at the elkhart dam tailwater  walleye weighing  pounds were harvested these fish ranged from˝ inches long and averaged  inches the number of walleye caught and released totaled   of the anglers interviewed were fishing for walleye over  of the anglers supported the  inch minimum length limit  the twin branch impoundment has been stocked five consecutive years  a creel survey to measure walleye catches and attitudes about the walleye program has not been conducted at twin branch however large catches of youngoftheyear walleye during fall electrofishing and reports from anglers indicate the population is developing well neil ledet fisheries biologist measures a st joseph river walleye collected during early spring sampling large walleye fingerling research when it comes to stocking fish bigger is usually better however production costs must be weighed against angling benefits in  crooked lake steuben co winona lake kosciusko co and sylvan lake noble co were stocked with  inch long walleye stocking density was  per acre at sylvan and winona lakes and  per acre at crooked plans are to stock these lakes three consecutive years to see if the large fingerlings provide fishing where small fingerlings failed fry are usually stocked at  per acre and the ˝ inch long fingerlings at acre for comparative purposes four fry can be produced for a penny and it cost a little over six cents to produce one ˝ inch fingerling each  inch walleye cost  the large fingerlings required for this research have been purchased from a private hatchery as indiana currently does not have the rearing ponds needed to grow walleye for the entire summer and still meet other fish production goals sampling will be conducted annually to evaluate each of the three experimental stockings prior to  all walleye fishing provided by the dfw has been done with multipleyear stockings of fry or ˝ inch long fingerlings there have been some waters where biologists felt that fishable walleye populations would have developed if larger fingerlings had been stocked this hypothesis is what led to the large fingerling walleye research sauger introductions biologists are also working to establish self sustaining sauger populations in the east and west forks of the white river sauger are popular members of the perch family of fishes along with walleye yellow perch and many species of darters they are native to some of indianas larger rivers the ef white river was stocked with sauger fingerlings six consecutive years   following the devastating fish kill on the wf white river in  the first of three planned sauger stockings was completed in june  some sampling has already been done and more is scheduled to evaluate these stockings again the goal is to restore naturally reproducing sauger populations in two rivers walleye size limit the fisheries section proposed a inch minimum length limit for walleye at three public meetings in march  anglers had been asking for a size limit and no one opposed the proposal justification for the size limit included  walleye have greater growth potential than was being realized at most stocked waters  walleye fishing in indiana is hatchery anglers responding to a statewide survey listed walleye  when asked which species of fish do you want the division of fish and wildlife to stock dependent it is too costly to stock fish and have them harvested during their first and second summer when they have the capability to live longer and grow larger  nearly  of the respondents to the  statewide angler survey supported or strongly supported a minimum length limit for walleye only  opposed a size limit and  were neutral the proposed inch minimum length limit for walleye went into effect in august  and it applies to all waters except the st joseph river st joseph  elkhart counties and ohio river there is a inch minimum length limit on walleye in indiana s portion of the st joseph river to be consistent with michigans  inch size limit the st joseph river originates in michigan flows through parts of indiana and then returns to michigan one size limit throughout the course of the river makes it easier for anglers to understand and comply with the walleye size limit has now been in place for six growing seasons and biologists are starting to compare population structure numbers sizes weights and growth rates before and after size limit implementation indianas daily bag limit is six for any  combination of walleye sauger or saugeye there is no closed season for walleye sauger or saugeye hatchery production and stocking  strategies eggs for indianas walleye program are taken from mature fish collected each april at  brookville reservoir the goal is  million green eggs these eggs will provide about   million walleye fry  million ˝ inch walleye fingerlings and  hybrid walleye  fingerlings walleye stocking densities at lakes  are  fryacre or   fingerlingsacre hybrid walleye and river  walleye stocking densities are  fingerlings per  acre hatchery manager dan jessup checks walleye eggs at cikana state fish hatchery due to concerns about fish
