ebh ii restructures the loan in connection with any potential restructuring of ebh ii’s indebtedness whether out of court or in bankruptcy there is a possibility that ebh ii may realize material taxable income under certain us federal income tax rules related to the treatment of foreign currency gains any such taxable income would arise because ebh ii’s functional currency is the us dollar
