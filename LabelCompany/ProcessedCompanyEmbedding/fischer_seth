fischer thank you mark and good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s call i will update you on our business strategy evaluation provide an update on our avanafil efforts as well as our qsymia commercialization activities vivus has a history and core strength of development product candidates through clinical testing and fda approval we’ve put ourselves in position to be able to explore acquiring value creating development stage assets as we reshape the vivus business model we are working closely with aquilo partners to identify and evaluate potential product development candidates our goal is to add one or two clinical states product candidates to our pipeline by the end of  which could come in the form of a license a codevelopment agreement a merger or acquisition or some other form in january  we entered into a worldwide license agreement with selten pharma inc for tacrolimus and ascomycin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension or pah and related vascular diseases pah is a chronic life threatening disease characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries those arteries between the heart and lungs due to severe constriction of these blood vessels these high pressures make it difficult for the heart to pump blood to the lungs to be oxygenated ultimately leading to heart failure all currently approved products treat the symptoms of pah but do not address the underlying disease currently lung transplantation is the only option for patients who are not responsive to current medical therapy stanford completed a randomized doubleblind phase a trial with tacrolimus in  class one and two pah patients titrated to target blood levels all target blood levels were well tolerated with no drugrelated serious adverse events nephrotoxicity or incident diabetes in addition stanford provided tacrolimus for compassionate use and three class iii or four pah patients the compassionate use demonstrated reduced rates of hospitalizations and functional class improvements were observed we have assumed full responsibility for the development and commercialization of the license compounds according to a february  life side capital analysis in  the worldwide and us markets for pah pharmaceutical treatments exceeded  billion and  billion respectively for  our goals for this program will be to develop or in license a proprietary formulation for tacrolimus and have a preind meeting with fda to obtain an ind and identify a potential clinical pathway to approval we believe that our collaboration partners are wellpositioned to take advantage of stendras  minute of onset high selectivity resulting a lower side effects and ability to be taken with food and drink that uniquely addresses unmet needs among the patients being treated with competitive products we continue to work closely with menarini our commercial alliance partner in europe australia and new zealand and metuchen pharmaceuticals our commercial alliance partner in the us canada south america and india to ensure the supply of avanafil and provide assistance with their clinical regulatory and commercial efforts spedra as avanafil is known in the eu and other parts of the world is available in europe at retail pharmacies and approximately  countries within the menarini territory menarini has also secured the commercial rights for mitsubishi tanabe pharma corporation for certain way of asia in march of this year the commercial rights for avanafil in africa the middle east turkey and the commonwealth of independent states including russia returned to us by sanofi to avoid adverse impacts to the regulatory approval applications and process specifically in russia and certain middle east countries sanofi will provide transition services to assist us in the regulatory process were excited to have this assetback from sanofi and are in the process of finding a commercial exploit who can fully exploit the commercial potential of avanafil and these territories as well as in mexico and central america on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with hetero of the lawsuit brought by us in response to heteros filing of an abbreviated new drug application or a nda under the settlement agreement we granted hetero a license to manufacture and commercialize the generic version of stendra described in its anda filing in the united states effective no sooner than october   the settlement agreement provide for a full settlement of all claims that were asserted in the suite now let me provide a qsymia commercial up date in the first quarter of  the us antiobesity pharmaceutical market increased by  when compared to the fourth quarter of  while the branded antiobesity segment including qsymia increased by  these increases were due to the seasonality of the antiobesity market and a significantly higher promotional spending in the branded antiobesity sector primarily by our competitiors which began december of  we believe this additional noise in the market price may have driven growth in the total branded antiobesity market including qsymia our qsymia digital campaign has leveraged the increasing consumer and patient interest in the branded antiobesity sector category during the first quarter of  qsymia web site traffic and savings cart downloads have increased significantly achieving volume not seen since the first quarter of  at the height of the branded market currently  of all new savings are required all line our patients who are new to the qsymia brand we believe this is due to our highly targeted withdrawal strategy and exposure with the qsymia efficacy message on the brand web site when patients are the most motivated to start a weight loss effort in july  the united states district court for the district of new jersey issued a claim construction of markman ruling governing patent litigation brought by vvus against teva and dr reddys a lawsuit were filed in response to anda filed by both teva and dr reddys in the ruling the courts adopted vivus’ proposed constructions for all but one of the disputed claim terms and adopted a compromised construction that was acceptable to vivus for the final claim term the next phase of the ongoing litigation with teva will be expert discovery the dr reddy’s case remains in fact discovery trial dates have not been scheduled in either case as we have discussed in the past we have a postmarketing requirement for qsymia to perform a cardiovascular outcomes trial or cvot todate there have been no indications throughout the qsymia clinical developmental program nor postmarketing experience of any increase in adverse cardiovascular events given this historical information along with the established safety profiles of phentermine and topiramate we continue to believe that qsymia poses no true cardiovascular safety risk we have been in dialogue with the fda most recently in a face to face meeting to discuss alternative strategies for obtaining cardiovascular or cv outcomes data that would be substantially more feasible and ensure timely collection of data to better inform on the cv safety of qsymia although we and consulted experts believe there is no overt signal for cv risk to justify the cvot we’ve committed to working with fda to reach a resolution there is no assurance however that fda will accept any data or measures short of those specified in the cvot to satisfy this requirement i will now turn the call back to mark to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of  i also refer you to the financial results and recent business updates included in our press release issued earlier today in our quarterly report on form q filed earlier today mark oki thank you seth total revenue was  million and  million for the first quarters of  and  respectively qsymia net product revenue was approximately  million and  million for the first quarters of  and  respectively in the first quarter of  we changed our revenue recognition methodology for qsymia sales from the sellthrough model to a selling model this change resulted in the recognition of  million of net revenue for product that was shipped to wholesalers prior to january   during the first quarter of  and  approximately  and  qsymia prescriptions were disbursed respectively net revenue per prescription excluding free trial offers was approximately  and  for the first quarters of  and  respectively beginning in the first quarter of  due to the change in our revenue recognition methodology for qsymia revenue recognized is based on units shipped into the wholesaler rather than the number of prescriptions filled in a period in the first quarter of  we shipped approximately  units of qsymia to the wholesalers the change to the selling revenue recognition model could result in higher volatility of qsymia sales compared to those historical reporting in the first quarter of  we also recognized revenue related to a onetime  million payment for a license to certain clinical data avanafil supply revenue was  million and  million for the first quarter of  and  respectively the variations in supply revenue are a result of the timing of orders placed by our partners that may or may not reflect enduser demand for stendra and spedra avanafil tablets currently have a month expiration date royalty revenue earned on our partners’ net sales of avanafil was  and  million for the first quarter of  and  respectively as a remainder beginning in the fourth quarter of  we no longer receive royalty revenue from net sales of stendra in the us as result to the licensing agreement with my touching total cost of goods with  million and  million for the first quarters of  and  respectively qsymia gross margin percentages were  and  for the first quarters of  and  respectively total selling and marketing expense with  million and  million for the first quarters of  and  respectively the decrease in  was primarily due to the realignments of our sales force refinement of our marketing and promotional program and continued cost control initiatives general and administrative expense was  million and  million for the first quarters of  and  respectively going forward our general and administrative expense will fluctuate based on activity within our business strategy review and litigation activity total research and development expense was  million and  million for the first quarters of  and  respectively research and development expenses in  include a  million spend from the upfront payment made to selten for tacrolimus and ascomycin we expect our research and development expenses to increase in  as we continue to support our qsymia post marketing requirement and continued development of tacrolimus for pah research and development expenses could increase significantly should we add product candidates to our portfolio cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities totaled  million at march   as compared to  million at december   the increase was primarily due to our system operation and debt servicing requirements i will now turn the call to seth for closing comments seth fischer thank you mark for  we’re excited for the opportunity to universe our strong cash position for the acquisition and development of a new product pipeline to drive value creation for our stockholders while addressing the unmet needs of patients we’ve engaged aquilo partners to assist us in identifying evaluating and acquiring pipeline products additionally our focus for vivus in  are to advance our pah development program including the development of a proprietary formulation of tacrolimus and having a preind meeting with fda to obtain an ind and identify a potential clinical pathway to approval continue to efficiently monetize qsymia in the us and seek to monetize qsymia and avanafil outside of us defend our qsymia intellectual property rights advance our efforts to address in a costeffective manner the remaining qsymia regulatory postmarketing requirements address and potentially reduce our outstanding debt balances and effectively manage our cost structure we will now take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of harold weber from aegis capital your line is open harold weber hi guys how are you doing seth fischer good how are you harold weber okay hanging in there i have a question for you on regard to the stendra what are we doing to try to lets say raise the consciousness of this product versus the competitors indiscernible just like that i mean the product its a very fine product happy to got positioned and you recommended it versus the others but it does seem like its getting much uptick and i’m trying to understand why  what we could do about it i think that is a very large market for it seth fischer well thank you the stendra as you know in the us we licensed to metuchen pharmaceuticals so they’re really responsible for all the sales and marketing of the product and as you know they took it over from endo and are currently really ramping up all their resources to better market the product for the future harold weber so you think that they’re at this point making a service commitment to stock marketing the product more substantially more nationally seth fischer yes metuchen i can tell you its very dedicated to the success of the product harold weber i mean this product i think should be making us a crap load of money and so far its just that i just don’t see it and the medical community from what i hear is very pleased with it so i will think the uptake should be a lot better seth fischer yes and there has been a number of different transitions with the product over the last several years but we’re very confident metuchen ability to really boost the product in the future harold weber and as far as selling the licensing overseas what  where are we holding with that seth fischer well we just recently received the rights back … harold weber right seth fischer … menarini has the rights in europe harold weber right seth fischer the rest of world rights were currently in the process of looking for the proper partner for that product harold weber okay do you believe that is sometime not too distant future we’re going to have another partner for the rest of the countries that are not covered presently seth fischer yes we’re  right now we’re already in that process so we’re entertaining different parties harold weber okay and regard to this new biologically trying to bring to market any idea of about what kind of expenses we’re going to incur on this year seth fischer this year expenses should be minimal but the most important thing is to really understand the trial design which will be important in our meeting our ind meeting which will happen later this year harold weber okay thanks seth seth fischer thank you operator there are no further questions in the queue at this time i turn the call back over to seth fischer chief executive officer seth fischer well thank you again for all of you attending today and we look forward to keeping you updated in the future have a good evening operator this concludes today’s business update teleconference
