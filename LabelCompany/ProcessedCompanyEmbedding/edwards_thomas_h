gallery this article is about the engine you may be looking for the railway series book the story library book the  magazine story or the other magazine story people say im old fashioned but i dont care the fat controller says im a useful engine — edward saved from scrap second season edward number  class fr k larger seagull designer sharp stewart  co builder atlas works built  configuration  top speed  mph arrived on sodor circa  edward is a blue furness railway k class mixedtraffic engine he runs his own branch line with boco edward is one of the oldest engines on sodor and is occasionally made fun of for his age despite this setback he is also very wise and optimistic and spreads his knowledge and encouraging attitude toward the other engines bio in the railway series edward was built by sharp stewart and company in glasgow scotland in  he worked on the furness railway before coming to sodor in  to finish the building of the north western railway after his work was completed in  edward was kept in a shed to the delight of the other engines who claimed that he was too old and weak to work edward was eventually let out again and proved that what he lacked in strength he made up for in work by pushing a stubborn gordon and his heavy goods train up gordons hill in  in  when thomas was fed up with fetching coaches for the big engines edward offered thomas to take his trucks however thomas having no experience with trucks was pushed down a hill and diverted into a siding later in  edward helped james doublehead a passenger train when the splendid red engine was acting out for some time afterwards edward was getting so old that his parts caused him to clank as he went along which led to the bigger engines teasing him about his age gordon and henry teased him about when a group of cows caused half of his cattle trucks to break away and derail but later got their comeuppance when they encountered a cow named bluebell on a bridge edward would later save an old traction engine named trevor from scrap when he encouraged the vicar of wellsworth to buy him however james would still talk down to edwards age and how slow he is but after he was left running down the main line without a driver thanks to two naughty boys who played with his controls edward proved himself to be a hero when he brought the inspector and james fireman to slow him down james could not thank edward enough for his heroic actions and the fat controller sent edward to the works to have his worn parts mended as a reward when edward came back everyone was very pleased to see him again some time afterwards edward received his own branch line and had two twin tank engines named bill and ben help take trucks from the china clay company to brendam along his line when the twins were playing tricks on a new diesel named boco edward put a stop to it and showed boco how to handle them soon edward and gordon were both talking about branch lines most to the disapproval of gordon that night there was a mishap at tidmouth which in favour edwards train went first which sent him down the mainline this was caused when the signalman at wellsworth was not informed of the delay and gordon went down to brendam some few evenings later when edward was taking a passenger train filled with enthusiasts home to tidmouth his crankpin snapped damaging his wheel splasher and running plate forcing the driver and fireman to take them off however edward was able to pull the heavy train back to tidmouth very late but with triumph boco looked after edwards branch line while edward was sent to the works again for repairs in  when an old coach named victoria was being restored edward quickly recognised her from the furness railway and listened to her story about when she worked with a tank engine named albert on his branch line alongside another coach named helena edward later took her to knapford junction for thomas to take to toby bio in the television series when trevor was to be the main star attraction for the vicars garden party edward wanted to help but did not know how his chance came when the vicar forgot to promote the party by putting up the posters so he suggested having them put up on his cab and coaches as part of the partys advertisement his plan worked and so many people came to the party that they raised a lot of money for the children the vicar later thanked edward and his crew for their idea in the fifth season episode haunted henry it is revealed that edward has a penchant for telling spooky stories on halloween that the other engines enjoy edward told henry that whenever an owl hoots a mist rolls in and when the mist is about there is a ghost about too in the sixth season episode scaredy engines he told them a story of a ghost engine that returns to the smelters in search of his lost whistle every halloween in addition to running his branch line edward often acts as a banker for other engines up gordons hill when their trains are too heavy in spite of edwards great history with the railway and his good relationship with the other engines his old age makes some engines think that he is unreliable gordon would always still tease and talk down about him even going as far as suggesting that he should retire when percy told his driver about this who told the fat controller he arranged for edward to show stepney how to run the loop line while duck did his work unfortunately duck got stuck on gordons hill when the troublesome trucks held him back when gordon came behind him he could not push duck up the hill edward was sent to help the double train up and when they arrived at knapford station the fat controller rebuked gordon for his horrible comments about edward gordon apologised to edward the following day and from then on he never suggested him retiring since then edwards skill as a banker is always valued among gordon and the others as seen in edward the great and you can do it toby in chickens to school edward exclaimed im always helping gordon up the hill however his speed left a lot to be desired in as good as gordon emily had to wait for edward at the crossing impatient emily snidely told him to hurry up calling him slowcoach when spencer visited the island of sodor and beat gordons record he insulted the sudrian engines who became fed up with spencers boastfulness they wanted to race spencer to the duke and duchess of boxfords summer house but the fat controller chose edward to go there instead gordon thought that edward should not be doing an express engines job and james thought that edward would let the whole railway down regardless edward tried his best and had several moments of triumph during the race gordon saw how hard edward was trying and took back his earlier words encouraging edward instead calling him a credit to the railway edward eventually won due to spencer falling asleep and felt like the pride of the sodor railway—and he was right edward has always been a kind and wise engine though in some scenarios he has acted a bit judgemental to newcomers for example in harvey to the rescue he claimed that harvey doesnt even look like an engine in thomas and the new engine he was one of the engines to spread rumours that neville wanted to bump the steam engines in edward strikes out he agreed with gordons element of doubt about rocky and called him a newfangled nonsense the narration at the episodes start reveals that this is because edward has worked on sodor the longest in both the first and third of these scenarios edward learned of harvey and rockys usefulness by their episodes ends in edward and the mail he did not want to embarrass himself in front of the other engines so he tried to take the mail train without asking percy who was in need of repairs for advice resulting in him delivering the mail to all the wrong places edward has also acted excitable in some episodes in the twelfth season episode steady eddie he was given a task of taking the new water wheel to great waterton he ignored the fat controllers advice to take the express track took all the bumpy tracks to show off and resulted in the water wheel almost being scrapped in thomas and the runaway kite he wanted to help thomas to chase after the fat controllers grandchildrens kite since then edward has tried to regain his usual self which one day made charlie think he was too old to have fun in charlie and eddie edward was upset about this so he tried to be as fun as charlie but this only caused even more trouble since then he has just stuck to being the wise and kind engine that he was of old in the fifteenth season edward was sent to work with harold for the day being given the chance to be a hero after observing gordon and rocky in action edward resolved to fulfil his hero role by being strong and fast and stern on his way to the sodor search and rescue centre edward found a miserable charlie and cheered him up by telling him a joke collected dowager hatts suitcase when it was sent to the wrong station and rescued a lost katie the sheepdog edward was still determined to be what he thought a hero but found that his time spent helping others had made him late for harold who was not at the rescue centre when edward chuffed in the fat controller reassured edward that being kind funny and gentle was edward being himself enough to be a hero and everyone cheered for him harold arrived looking for edward who just smiled in the eighteenth season he was still being teased by gordon who thought he was unreliable for breaking down frequently but edward claimed that he had not broken down in ages when gordon later got stuck on his hill edward came to push him as they reached the top of the hill gordon just carried on without saying thank you edward complained about gordons ungratefulness to thomas who came up with a plan thomas challenged gordon to a race across the island as gordon nearly caught him up thomas pulled onto the same track which meant gordon had no choice but to follow him at gordons hill the two engines were going so slowly that gordon stopped and got stuck again as thomas carried on his way edward arrived this time it was edwards turn to call gordon unreliable for always getting stuck on his own hill edward then began to carry on his way too but gordon begged him to help gordon promised to never call him old and unreliable again edward forgave gordon and gave him a push the big blue engine even said thank you once they had reached the top of the hill in sodors legend of the lost treasure he told thomas who was being mended at the steamworks that rocky had discovered a pirate ship in the cavern in which thomas had fallen into earlier despite thomas discovering it first later while working at the docks salty told him henry james porter and cranky about a lost pirate when thomas felt that max and montys recklessness was going too far edward told thomas to ignore them he laughed at thomas percy and toby for being scared of a cow which they thought was a troll and he was also scared of going out in the night when the engines thought a glowing henry was a ghost edward was among the engines who were afraid hugo was the start of steamies being replaced in the great race edward was one of the many engines who wanted to go to the great railway show but instead was left on sodor persona edward is kindhearted and always keen to help a friend in need the small engines trust him to lend a listening ear and sympathetic advice he is a hard worker too and always does his best to finish a job if ever an engine misbehaves or acts out its edward that the fat controller turns to in order to soothe things out sadly the big engines often see edward as oldfashioned and slow while it is true he is the oldest engine on the north western railway  it must be noted he helped build it  he has proved time and time again that he is more than capable of working as hard as any engine and he is a much cleverer and wiser engine too in fact for a time he and boco were the only engines who looked after bill and ben and knew how to put them in their place should they misbehave like any other wise old engine he stands for no nonsense from anyone especially from the bigger engines from calling all engines to the sixteenth season edward had occasionally expressed insecurity in himself in that he refuses to work and talk with the diesels such as diesel arry and bert he was one of steam engines who blamed the diesels for wrecking tidmouth sheds also edward keeps secrets from the other engines and sir topham hatt when he was once leaking steam and likewise when he was told to pull the post train whilst percy was being repaired since the seventeenth season edward has been portrayed with his original personality such as when he gave thomas advice to ignore max and monty and accepted james request to bring the mayor of sodor to callan castle basis furness railway k class the reverend w awdry stated that edward is based on a heavily modified sharp stewart and co larger seagull k class supplied to the furness railway in  sodor historian martin clutterbuck notes that edward bears a close resemblance to an lner d glen nbr reid class k  from the london and north eastern railway at any rate the reverend w awdry used an engine of this class to represent edward on his model railway fowler tender visible crovans gate works modifications are making the rear splashers flush with the cab removal of the coupling rod splashers new cab windows as opposed to cutaways in his cab side sheets and square cab lookouts as opposed to the original round ones in both the railway series and television series edward is depicted with a fowler tender livery edward is painted in the north western railways sky blue livery with redandyellow lining and the number  painted on his tender sides in bright yellow with a red border in the railway series he carries two builders plates on the sides of his cab it can be assumed that before arriving on sodor edward was painted in the furness railways indian red livery with black lining the letters fr written in yellow on his tender sides and black wheels inspiration the inspiration for edward himself came from the reverend w awdrys watching trains on the great western railway as a child he said in an interview with brian sibley for the thomas the tank engine man that to him the noise of the locomotives exhaust almost sounded like dialogue  for example the larger engine having trouble climbing the hills would appear to be saying i cant do it i cant do it and the smaller engine helping them would sound like it was saying i will do it i will do it i will do it later the reverend awdry told his son a bedtime story about an engine who was sad because he was never taken out of the shed for being old upon being asked what the engines name was by his son the reverend awdry picked the name edward

the only engine whose crew has been named in the railway series in the foreword of edward the blue engine their names were given as charlie sand driver and sidney hever fireman their surnames came from their duties one of the drivers jobs is to sand the rails when they are slippery to let the engines wheels grip while the fireman heaves coal to the firebox their christian names came from an engine crew from the wisbech and upwell tramway three of edwards models are currently on display two at drayton manor and the other is in japan at the hara model railway museum previously on display at nitrogen studios edward was not in any known draft of thomas and the magic railroad according to phil fehrle  there was not enough screen time and opportunity to utilise him in a way that added any real value to the film in steady eddie charlie and eddie and edward the hero edward refers to himself as eddie charlie also refers to him by this name eddie also happens to be edwards real name in the

steep east hampshire and initially published his poetry under the name edward eastaway the american poet robert frost who was living in england at the time in particular encouraged thomas then more famous as a critic to write poetry and their friendship was so close that the two planned to reside side by side in the united states frosts most famous poem the road not taken was inspired by walks with thomas and thomass indecisiveness about which route to take by august  the village of dymock in gloucestershire had become the residence of a number of literary figures including lascelles abercrombie wilfrid gibson and robert frost edward thomas was a visitor at this time thomas immortalised the nowabandoned railway station at adlestrop in a poem of that name after his train made a stop at the cotswolds station on  june  shortly before the outbreak of the first world war war serviceedit his memorial stone near steep thomas enlisted in the artists rifles in july  despite being a mature married man who could have avoided enlisting he was unintentionally influenced in this decision by his friend frost who had returned to the us but sent thomas an advance copy of the road not taken the poem was intended by frost as a gentle mocking of indecision particularly the indecision that thomas had shown on their many walks together however most audiences took the poem more seriously than frost intended and thomas similarly took it seriously and personally and it provided the last straw in thomas decision to enlist thomas was promoted to corporal and in november  was commissioned into the royal garrison artillery as a second lieutenant he was killed in action soon after he arrived in france at arras on easter monday  april  to spare the feelings of his widow helen she was told the fiction of a bloodless death ie that thomas was killed by the concussive blast wave of one of the last shells fired as he stood to light his pipe and that there was no mark on his body however a letter from his commanding officer franklin lushington written in  and discovered many years later in an american archive states that in reality the cause of thomas death was due to being shot clean through the chest w h davies was devastated by the death and his commemorative poem killed in action edward thomas was included in daviess  collection raptures thomas is buried in the
