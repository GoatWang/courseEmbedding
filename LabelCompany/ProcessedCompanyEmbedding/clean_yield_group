clean yield staff contact us news  insights client login investment style  clean yield  infocleanyieldcom norwich vt client login investment style clean yield asset management takes a longterm approach to investing favoring highquality holdings and diversified portfolios to limit risk equities our approach to the stock market is to focus on individual companies while considering economic sector trends and monetary economic and geopolitical developments in the us and around the world we seek stocks that are undervalued relative to the cash that a company generates especially cash in excess of the company’s ordinary business needs we also favor highquality companies in strong financial shape that have a record of consistent earnings and dividends we particularly favor those that are well managed with robust profit margins and an emphasis on sustainability we believe that companies with top managers that adhere to high standards of environmental social and corporate governance esg performance will be industry and stock market leaders we take a longterm approach but are aware that things do change sometimes rapidly we typically sell a stock when its longterm business prospects decline its stock becomes substantially overvalued its esg profile deteriorates significantly or we find more compelling investment ideas we trim large holdings as a matter of prudence—within capital gains tax constraints—to reduce a portfolio’s risk we employ four equity portfolio strategies core equity income aggressive and sustainable solutions we work closely with our clients to determine which of these is the best fit for their goals and risk profiles we can also adjust these strategies to accommodate individual clients’ social and financial interests bonds for balanced accounts we buy investmentgrade bonds and typically ladder maturities to reduce the risk that interest rates might be unattractively low when bonds mature and need to be reinvested given the historically low interest rates of recent years we generally have limited bond maturities to several years out in anticipation of more normal higher rates in the years ahead cash finally we usually maintain cash reserves of  in our portfolios though we’re not “market timers” who jump into and out of markets there are times when conditions are extraordinarily favorable or unfavorable this is a business of probabilities not certainties and when market prices are substantially above longterm norms reducing likely future returns we will build up cash reserves toward the high end of the range so that when more favorable opportunities arise we will have the means to take advantage of them impact investments when appropriate for a client’s risk profile we offer a variety of impact investments as part of portfolios these investments typically make up  of an account and range from community investment notes to private equity and debt offerings of small food and agriculture
