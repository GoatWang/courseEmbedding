jerry moyes  wikipedia jerry moyes from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search jerry moyes is the founder chairman and ceo of phoenixbased swift transportation one of the largest trucking companies in the united states moyes is also owner of charter airline swift air moyes is also controlling owner of sme steel contractors inc a steel erector company based in utah he was a majority owner of the phoenix coyotes of the national hockey league before the coyotes filed bankruptcy and were sold to the nhl in  and the arizona sting of the national lacrosse league moyes is also a limited partner in the arizona diamondbacks and was once a minority owner of the phoenix suns a graduate of weber state college moyes is currently vice president at large of the american trucking association and previously served as president of the arizona motor transport association near the end of  jerry announced he will retire at the end of the year richard stocking currently holds the title of president and ceo of swift transportation jerry and his wife vickie have been married for over  years and have  children and  grandchildren phoenix coyotesedit moyes was originally a minority partner in steve ellmans ownership group which bought the coyotes from richard burke in  on sept   ellman sold controlling interest in the coyotes arizona sting and the lease to jobingcom arena to moyes he retained wayne gretzky as partowner and head of hockey operations court filings show moyes was never keen to own the coyotes and had no interest in hockey he acquired control of the club in  after falling out over a real estate development with former business partner steve ellman afterwards moyes tried to find a buyer for the coyotes and he chafed at the leagues interference in his attempts in  moyes told gary bettman and other league officials that he would stop funding the club the league agreed to provide emergency funding in return for moyes turning over his voting control the acrimony was made public in may  when bettman and daly came close to selling the coyotes to jerry reinsdorf owner of the chicago bulls and chicago white sox a move that would have seen moyes receive almost nothing from the sale on may   moyes promptly put the coyotes into chapter  bankruptcy protection and announced a plan to sell the club to jim balsillie moyes also filed a lawsuit against the nhl alleging the league was an “illegal cartel” bettman was furious arguing the league had been blindsided and that moyes did not have the authority to put the club into bankruptcy protection moyes was saddled with massive financial losses that dated to the time the former winnipeg jets moved to phoenix unable to turn around the teams fiscal picture he filed for chapter  bankruptcy on may   as part of the filing he agreed in principle to sell the coyotes to a group headed by research in motion coceo jim balsillie who intended to move the team to hamilton ontario the league responded by stripping moyes of virtually all of his ownership authority though he is still nominally the teams owner the nhl argued that moyes had no right to make the filing because numerous agreements hed signed with the league in return for financial assistance specifically barred him from filing for bankruptcy it also claims that moyes effectively surrendered control of the team by signing the agreements a bankruptcy judge has scheduled a hearing for may   to determine who actually controls the team in october  baum rejected the nhls bid as well as balsillies million offer the judge ruled that balsillies bid faced too many legal obstacles however he said the nhl could revise its bid to include concessions to moyes and gretzky the nhl had originally taken the position that neither moyes and gretzky were legitimate creditors because they were owners under chapter  proceedings owners usually rank below other creditors and rarely receive any of the proceeds from asset sales on november   moyes officially sold the coyotes to the nhl for  million referencesedit    httpwwwusatodaycomsportshockeynhlxhtm external linksedit jerry moyes on phoenix coyotes website v t e

moyes is also owner of charter airline swift air moyes is also controlling owner of sme steel contractors inc a steel erector company based in utah he was a majority owner of the phoenix coyotes of the national hockey league before the coyotes filed bankruptcy and were sold to the nhl in  and the arizona sting of the national lacrosse league moyes is also a limited partner in the arizona diamondbacks and was once a minority owner of the phoenix suns a graduate of weber state college moyes is currently vice president at large of the american trucking association and previously served

transportation jerry and his wife vickie have been married for over  years and have  children and  grandchildren phoenix coyotesedit moyes was originally a minority partner in steve ellmans ownership group which bought the coyotes from richard burke in  on sept   ellman sold controlling interest in the coyotes arizona sting and the lease to jobingcom arena to moyes he retained wayne gretzky as partowner and head of hockey operations court filings show moyes was never keen to own the coyotes and had no interest in hockey he acquired control of the club in  after falling out over a real estate development with former business partner steve ellman afterwards moyes tried to find a buyer for the coyotes and he chafed at the leagues interference in his attempts in  moyes told gary bettman and other league officials that he would stop funding the club the league agreed to provide emergency funding in return for moyes turning over his voting control the acrimony was made public in may  when bettman and daly came close to selling the coyotes to jerry reinsdorf owner of the chicago bulls and chicago white sox a move that would have seen moyes receive almost nothing from the sale on may   moyes promptly put the coyotes into chapter  bankruptcy protection and announced a plan to sell the club to jim balsillie moyes also filed a lawsuit against the nhl alleging the league was an “illegal cartel” bettman was furious arguing the league had been blindsided and that moyes did not have the authority to put the club into bankruptcy protection moyes was saddled with massive financial losses that dated to the time the former winnipeg jets moved to phoenix unable to turn around the teams fiscal picture he filed for chapter  bankruptcy on may   as part of the filing he agreed in principle to sell the coyotes to a group headed by research in motion coceo jim balsillie who intended to move the team to hamilton ontario the league responded by stripping moyes of virtually all of his ownership authority though he is still nominally the teams owner the nhl argued that moyes had no right to make the filing because numerous agreements hed signed with the league in return for financial assistance specifically barred him from filing for bankruptcy it also claims that moyes effectively surrendered control of the team by signing the agreements a bankruptcy judge has scheduled a hearing for may   to determine who actually controls the team in october  baum rejected the nhls bid as well as balsillies million offer the judge ruled that balsillies bid faced too many legal obstacles however he said the nhl could revise its bid to include concessions to moyes and gretzky the nhl had originally taken the position that neither moyes and gretzky were legitimate creditors because they were owners under chapter  proceedings owners usually rank below other creditors and rarely receive any of the proceeds from asset sales on november   moyes officially sold the

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
