travis hoium tmfflushdraw feb   at pm point energy partners lp nasdaqcafd and terraform global inc nasdaqglbl were supposed to be two of the renewable energy industrys leading yieldcos point energy partners was supposed to be a way for first solar and sunpower to fund solar projects in the us and terraform global was central to sunedisons growth plans abroad but since their launch both yieldcos have been a disappointment for investors point energy parters has plunged from a launch price of  per share to  as im writing and terraform global has genuine concerns it will end up in bankruptcy given the current state of these companies heres a look at which stock investors should throw out and which one they should take another look at image source getty images whats the point of a yieldco the point of a yieldco is to own renewable energy projects that spit off cash and pay that cash to investors in the form of a dividend they intend to use their stock as a source of funding along with debt to buy projects and add to their dividends in the future this structure requires a relatively low dividend yield so that projects can be acquired accretively if projects are bought with a rate of return of  and the company has a dividend yield of  the shares issued to fund acquisitions wouldnt be additive to future dividends they would be harmful so yieldcos with dividend yields over  have typically not been able to grow because they cant acquire products accretively this is the predicament point energy partners and terraform global find themselves in points dividend yield is a lofty  and management recently said it would only grow its dividend  in  below the  growth the dividend has had since the yieldco launched and terraform global is in so much flux its dividend is suspended altogether so both companies have to be valued based on what they are today with little growth built in the worst case scenario for these yieldcos if growth isnt likely then we should look at the downside risk for both stocks point energy partners currently has a dividend yield of  and  years of weighted average life retaining on asset contracts with offtakers the worst that can happen outside of the stock falling is investors taking their dividend over the next two decades and getting no growth in the payout terraform global is in much worse shape its still possible the company could be dragged into bankruptcy by sunedison although the likelihood of that now is small instead a buyout is being discussed with brookfield asset management which could take the entire company private but the highest offer thats been put on the table is  per share below where shares are trading now if terraform globals range of possibilities are  to less than where shares trade now with no dividend on the horizon what is there to like about the stock the better yieldco today given the sheer upheaval at terraform global point energy partners is definitely the better stock it has a solid dividend and long contracts that will keep cash flowing in and if the stock recovers and the dividend yield falls it could eventually be a growth stock which would be good for the yieldcos future  travis hoium

search what to take from point energy partners lps changing growth outlook management thinks growth may slow in the future which wouldnt be entirely bad for longterm investors travis hoium tmfflushdraw jan   at pm outperforming both plans and expectations hasnt been enough for point energy partners lp nasdaqcafd to impress investors fiscal fourthquarter  results announced thursday after the market closed beat revenue net income and adjusted ebitda guidance and if it werent for a slight delay in a  million reimbursement the company would have beaten cash available for distribution cafd guidance as well  the stocks relatively poor performance and dividend yield of  as of the time of this writing has left sponsors first solar nasdaqfslr and sunpower nasdaqspwr looking for alternatives to selling projects to the yieldco and if that lasts long enough the yieldcos value to the sponsors could soon dissipate  a residential solar community project developed by sunpower image source sunpower the numbers quarterly results were solid for point energy partners as acquisitions added to the portfolio revenue was  million net income was  million ebitda came in at  million and cafd was  million the cafd figure would have been around  million if it werent for the delayed reimbursement from a utility partner  this performance continues point energy partners streak of meeting or beating expectations as a public company and it made big moves in acquiring a  stake in the sunpowerdeveloped  mw henrietta project and a  stake in the first solar developed  mw stateline project but we may be entering a lull in project acquisitions that could lead to slower growth  lowering expectations one slight disappointment for investors was the announcement that point energy partners only plans to grow the dividend  in  thats below the  dividend growth rate since the company was launched and is at the low end of guidance  the driver of the reduction in the dividend is the yieldco market overall low stock prices have led to higher dividend yields than companies expected which make it difficult to issue shares to buy projects accretively point energy partners current  dividend yield isnt conducive to new share offerings to fund projects and sponsors apparently think there are better buyer options elsewhere  there are two ways to take the dynamic of dividend growth and funding acquisitions one is to be disappointed the dividend wont grow but then you have to realize that a  dividend yield with contracted cash flows for  years is still a great value the other reaction is to respect managements restraint in waiting for the ability to fund projects accretively instead of just trying to grow for growths sake many yieldcos have erred on the side of growth and its usually come back to haunt them in the long run  frustration setting in amid the solid performance in the quarter sponsors sunpower and first solar are getting frustrated with the yieldcos high dividend yield and inability to buy projects they want to sell sunpower pulled the  mw ipt solar gen project and  mw of stanford projects from the right of first offer rofo portfolio and replaced them with the  mw boulder solar  project and  mw of commercial projects sunpower also asked to have the  mw el pelicano project removed and first solar would like to remove the  mw switch station  taken as a whole the sponsors are pulling projects from the rofo portfolio that they want to monetize near term and replacing them with projects further down the line that may not be a problem if the yieldco recovers in a year or two but it shows their frustration with the inability to drop down assets at will on the flip side it may also mean they can sell projects more easily and with a higher price on the open market than to point energy partners which is good for the sponsors  what to take from point energy partners results point energy partners may be slowing down its growth plans and sponsors may have to adjust where theyre selling projects but thats not all bad for investors  at worst point energy partners is a great dividend stock with an average  years of contracted cash flows on solar projects that essentially guarantee the dividend for years to come and if the stock recovers in the future it can go on a growth spurt again  despite a slowdown in point energy partners potential dividend growth this is a stock ill hold on to for a long time to come  travis hoium owns shares of point energy partners first solar and sunpower the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks
