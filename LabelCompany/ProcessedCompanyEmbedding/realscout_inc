realscout does marketing  cookies  miles and  smiles how realscout does marketing september   since its beginnings realscout has focused on building an innovative and empowering home search experience that keeps the agent in control while giving buyers the search tools they’ve come to expect so when it came time to develop relationships with new agents we didn’t think in terms of how many people we could reach — we asked ourselves how many people we could truly delight that’s when the idea of delivering cookies realscoutcookies came to us instead of buying banner ads that no one would see or postcards that no one would read we chose to spend our money creating a delightful experience for the people we care about most the agents and brokers who sell real estate realscoutcookies was a way to bring our belief in creating delightful experiences to the real world delightful products delightful marketing the end result was a lot of smiles some great time spent thanking our current customers and a fun way to meet potential realscout customers the main thing we learned focusing on delight is always the right thing creating delight doesn’t have to be expensive and it’s always more effective than a postcard so the next time you’re strategizing a marketing initiative remember to start with delight you’ll create a campaign that gives everyone a whole lot to smile about learn more about realscoutcookies results in the infographic below the process prior to our first realscoutcookies event on august th we publicized the opportunity for agents to for free cookies a press release blog post and several facebook promotions later we had a long list of open houses to attend – we delivered  freshly baked cookies between the hours of pm and pm in total our team members drove more than  miles and met with over  agents twothirds of which were not currently realscout members not only did we have fun spreading the word about realscout and meeting with agents and potential clients alike we also had a great time bonding as a team with our families in tow “we had so much fun delivering cookies at every stop my kids and my dog peejay would get out eat a cookie and have fun with the agent we stopped to see” said realscout team member shannon bertucci of course not a cookie was left in sight we saw  mentions across social media platforms including one of our favorite tweets from bryan k babcock with keller williams realty san jose “realscout those cookies are so good they should be illegal” the numbers  the lessons now that we’re back at the office and have had the time to digest the event – and the cookies – we’ve got numbers and lessons to share with you the numbers in a nutshell… our realscout team members drove  miles to  open houses met with  agents and potential clients and delivered  cookies  cities participated and twothirds of the participants were nonmembers costs our team spent  for cookies  for press release distribution  for flyers  for lunch and  for facebook press cost per lead all said and done realscoutcookies drove our cost per lead down to  realscout has already signed up a handful of new customers that stemmed from this event lessons learned branding is key make sure you have a clear branding strategy that speaks to your offerings some people thought that we were a cookie delivery company instead of a software company know your goal and calculate the resources needed we were short staffed to get to all of the open houses with some cookies being delivered towards the end of the open house be personal and have fun experiment to discover what works for your community and measure your findings to take steps forward in the future sometimes you’ve just got to think outside the cookie jar that’s what we do at
