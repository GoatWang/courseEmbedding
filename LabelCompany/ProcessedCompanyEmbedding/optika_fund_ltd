httpwwwoctafinancecomoptikafundjustsubmittedformdannouncingmillionfundraisingcaptchasubmit optika fund financing optika fund llc limited liability company just had published form d because of  million financing optika fund was able to finance itself with  million that is  of the financing offer the total private financing amount was  million the fundraising form was filled on  the reason for the financing was unspecified optika fund is based in pennsylvania the firm’s business is pooled investment fund the form was signed by geoffrey m lewis cfo of managing member the company was incorporated

analysis of optika fund offering on average firms in the pooled investment fund sector sell  of the total offering amount optika fund sold  of the offering could this mean that the trust in optika fund is high the average fundraising amount for companies in the pooled investment fund industry is  million the offering was  smaller than the average of  million of course this should not be taken as negative businesses get financed for a variety of needs and reasons the minimum investment for this financing was set at  if you know more about the reasons for the fundraising please comment below what is form d what it is used for form d disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors the information in form d is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it this is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing this could help competitors entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer why fundraising reporting is good for optika fund also despite geoffrey m lewis’s reporting disadvantages optika fund llc could benefit from this reporting first it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed the odds are higher that it will stay in the business second this could attract other investors such as venturecapital firms funds and angels third positive pr effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders receive news  ratings via email  enter your email address
