we believe that showing operating net income loss annualized operating return on average common shareholders equity including and excluding average aoci both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how we analyze our performance in this regard we believe that providing only a gaap presentation of net income loss would make it more difficult for users of our financial information to evaluate our underlying business we also believe that equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow us and the insurance industry as a whole exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that we provide this nongaap financial information on a regular basis a reconciliation of our net income loss attributable to common shareholders to operating net income loss is provided above note  diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is used to calculate per share data except where it is antidilutive to earnings per share or where there is a net loss when it is antidilutive or when a net loss occurs basic weighted average common shares outstanding is utilized in the calculation of net loss per share and net operating loss per share note  integration costs related to the catlin acquisition were completed in the second quarter of  comment on regulation g xl presents its operations in ways it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors analysts rating agencies and others who use xls financial information in evaluating xls performance  this press release contains the presentation of i operating net income loss operating net income which is defined as net income loss attributable to common shareholders excluding our net investment income  life funds withheld assets  our net realized gains losses on investments sold  excluding life funds withheld assets  our net realized gains losses on investments sold including otti and net unrealized gains losses on investments trading  life funds withheld assets  our net realized and unrealized gains losses on derivatives  our net realized and

subsidiary xl life insurance and annuity company and the partial sale of our holdings in new ocean capital management  our loss on the inception of the us term life retro arrangements  our loss on the early extinguishment of the notes assumed in conjunction with the catlin acquisition and  a provision benefit for income tax on items excluded from operating income ii annualized return on average common shareholders equity roe based on operating net income loss operating roe iii operating roe excluding average aoci both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs and iv fully diluted tangible book value per common share  common shareholders equity excluding goodwill and intangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding at the period end date combined with the dilutive impact of potential future share issues at any period end these items are nongaap financial measures as defined in regulation g the reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in accordance with regulation g is included in this press release on pages  and  although the investment of premiums to generate income or loss and realize capital gains or losses is an integral part of xls operations the determination to realize capital gains or losses is independent of the underwriting process  in addition under applicable gaap accounting requirements losses can be recognized as the result of other than temporary declines in value and from goodwill impairment charges without actual realization  in this regard certain users of xls financial information including certain rating agencies evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the operational sources of income without the effects of these two variables furthermore these users believe that for many companies the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely a function of economic and interest rate conditions net realized and unrealized gains losses on derivatives include all derivatives entered into by xl other than certain credit derivatives and the life retrocession embedded derivative with respect to credit derivatives because xl and its insurance company operating affiliates generally hold financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded similar with other companies treatment of such contracts as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance net investment income  life funds withheld assets and net realized gains losses on the life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments  life funds withheld assets have been excluded because as a result of the greycastle life retro arrangement xl no longer shares in the risks and rewards of the underlying performance of the life funds withheld assets that support these retrocession arrangements  the returns on the life funds withheld assets are passed directly to the reinsurer pursuant to a contractual arrangement that is accounted for as a derivative  therefore net investment income from the life funds withheld assets and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with these greycastle life retro arrangements are not relevant to xls underlying business performance foreign exchange gains losses in the income statement are only one element of the overall impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on xls financial position and are not representative of any economic gain or loss made by xl  accordingly it is not a relevant indicator of financial performance and it is excluded in summary xl evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit in addition to presenting net income loss xl believes that showing operating net income loss enables investors and other users of xls financial information to analyze xls performance in a manner similar to how management of xl analyzes performance in this regard xl believes that providing only a gaap presentation of net income loss would make it much more difficult for users of xls financial information to evaluate xls underlying business also as stated above xl believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow xl and the insurance industry as a whole exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that xl provide this nongaap financial information on a regular basis operating roe is a widely used measure of any companys profitability that is calculated by dividing annualized operating net income for any period other than a fiscal year when actual operating income is used by the average of the opening and closing common shareholders equity xl establishes target operating roes for its total operations segments and lines of business if xls operating roe targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time xl seeks to reevaluate these lines operating roe including and excluding average aoci both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs are additional measures of company profitability  the most significant component of this exclusion is the mark to market fluctuations on xls investment portfolio that have not been realized through sales andor distortions to xls performance from integration costs related to the acquisition of catlin  by providing these additional measures users of our financial statements have the ability to include or exclude these items when considering our performance either on a standalone basis or for purposes of peer performance comparison xl believes that fully diluted tangible book value per common share is a financial measure important to investors and other interested parties who benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry  however this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry view original contenthttpwwwprnewswirecomnewsreleasesxlgroupltdannouncessecondquarterresultshtml source
