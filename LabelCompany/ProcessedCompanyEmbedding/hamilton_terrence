here the soffits of the inserted steel beams are left revealed the kitchen winds around the central columnif the thought of a domestic ‘knock through’ doesn’t usually set an architect’s heart racing it might in the salubrious west london residential street of hamilton terrace here architect threefold was employed to take its client’s m lower ground floor apartment in an edwardian villa pull it back to its original enclosing walls and completely redesign it ‘given that this floor would traditionally have been ‘below stairs’ it was different from the rooms above it in that there weren’t the usual mouldings architraves and features that characterise the upper floors’ recalls threefold director jack hosea the relative starkness might have influenced the practice’s plan to introduce the decorative element by way of a ‘cabinet wall’ that not only incorporates different functions according to which direction it faces but acts as the de facto domestic divide ‘the cabinet wall became a sort of piece of transmuting furniture – a storage wall glass vitrines kitchen units a piece of dining room furniture an ‘amped up’ threshold between the reconfigured public and private areas’ he explains the floor’s new open nature was helped by the fact that at lower ground there was no need to provide a dedicated compartmented fire escape to the main door meaning the cabinet wall was free to wind its way around the open spaces of the flat entirely timber clad it became the defining feature of the space hosea says ‘we really liked the rich red expressive grain of douglas fir that emphasised the wall’s horizontal nature’ it also helped to disguise what are in fact basic storage carcasses ennobled by the douglas fir appliqué – given extra quality through the judicious use of brass and glass vitrines that ‘gave the wall real depth’ and bespoke brass pulls and fittings  given the unifying strength of the effect hosea thinks it was money well spent saying that you could spend the same kind of money just on the kitchen but for threefold it was about directing money towards the big wins to make the sure the kitchen was just part of the bigger architectural idea to this end once it was in the kitchen zone it went for unifying cm thick concrete worktops which were castin place in sections the kitchen top was set off with the reclaimed sink and mixer tap which the practice had dechromed to bring it back to its brass finish for the floor the firm chose a sealed lapicida blue limestone with riven finish to give it extra grip which also offset the polished concrete worktop counterpointing the brick but picking up on its module threefold went for a very pale grey bricksized tile on the back walls ‘it was a smooth textural moment in among  the rich grain of the joinery’ says hoseapale grey tiles and pale douglas fir counterpoint the dark blue limestone floor jack hosea director threefold we really like using valchromat engineered coloured wood – it has a kind of powdercoated finish and beaded edges that give it a homogenous solid look we used it on another of our projects murray mews in camden where we chose a matt lacquered option it’s also nice used in bright colours to inject some life into splash backs and reveals while it’s worth spending money on a good tap – cheap ones will soon start to drip – we’ve never been fans of ‘catering style’ hose faucets preferring the simplicity of ideally a vola fitting but best is to source something reclaimed that can give your kitchen a unique feel which is something we did at hamilton terrace floor finishes will always be project specific but we’d avoid timber in kitchen areas every time as it’s easily damaged by moisture instead we’d veer more towards polished concrete or a sealed stone

believe youre in nyc  city hall end of an era vernon boulevard bridge  hamilton grange in july  i was wandering around hamilton heights on an overcast and overhumid afternoon in quest of alexander hamilton‘s house built in  that he called the grange in honor of his family’s ancestral house in scotland the word grange has its roots in the medieval latin word for grain granica and has been brought through french and then english in its present form originally it meant granary and then widened its meaning to barn and even further to farm the national grange of the order of patrons of husbandry founded in  is america’s largest agricultural advocacy organization hamilton was born in charlestown nevis and arrived in new york at about age  his date of birth is uncertain it is either  or  to attend king’s college now columbia university after clerking at several firms and attending the school that later became princeton university he was quickly swept up by the fervor for independence that was gathering steam in the colonies and served with distinction in the revolutionary army eventually becoming the chief of staff of george washington and the rank of lieutenant colonel he would go on to cowrite the federalist papers that promoted the ratification of the us constitution and then became the usa’s first secretary of the treasury he founded the bank of new york the nation’s first national mint and in a foray into publishing the newyork evening post hamilton never lost his attachment to new york city and in  built the first house he had ever owned in upper manhattan in what was then completely rural land on a hilly acre plot on what would become west rd street west of convent avenue over the years hamilton had rebuffed requests for duels from those he opposed politically or thought themselves wronged but when he assisted aaron burr’s victorious opponent in the ny state gubernatorial election in  burr then the sitting vice president challenged hamilton and was acceded the duel took place on the morning of  in weehawken nj hamilton fired first and missed it is unclear whether he meant to miss or not burr did not miss and hit hamilton in the abdomen hamilton was rowed back across the hudson where he died of his wound at a friend’s place in greenwich village burr’s name is in general disgrace though he is thought to be misunderstood by some historians hamilton was buried in downtown trinity cemetery in  hamilton grange an early example in  of what became known as the federalist style was acquired by st lukes’ episcopal church and moved from its original hilltop location  feet away to convent avenue just north of the church three of its four sides had porches that were removed during the relocation and the grange was hemmed in a tight fit between the church and an apartment building despite becoming part of the national parks system and its employment by st luke’s as a chapel it gradually fell into genteel shabbiness   photo new york times that changed beginning in june  when national parks very gently moved the grange to its third location an empty part of the northern end of st nicholas park across from hamilton terrace parks then spent m to rehabilitate the building adding new porches that had been stripped away during the first move the grange reopened to the public in  much more was done than that — moldings mantels and ornamentation were reproduced to  specifications and reintroduced and original furniture including pieces owned by hamilton himself including a pianoforte seen here were added other tables chairs beds etc are careful reporoductions the octagonalshaped dining room now sees as much sun as it originally did when hamilton lived there though the desk here is a reproduction the original can be found at the museum of the city of new york at th avenue and east th street photos national parks service and new york times in an era when so much history has been lost we can be glad that in this case hamilton grange has able and dedicated caretakers hamilton heights is full of historic buildings of all types st lukes’ episcopal church which saved the grange in  is still here in its  romanseque revival building designed by rh richardson the parish has been in existence since  it is a descendant church of stlukeinthefields of grenwich village after a protest trinity offered to pay st luke’s  for its property according to penelope tuttle’s  book ”history of st luke’s church” st luke’s accepted and the church decided to move she wrote ”far enough north to be sure of peace for at least a good long term of years” this turned out to be the northeast corner of st street and convent avenue at the edge of a high plateau with an emerging stock of sizable row houses  in  st luke’s held its first uptown service not in its present church but in the  house of alexander hamilton on the next lot up just north of st street — it had moved the hamilton house from rd street and convent avenue to make way for more row houses the vestry was struggling for cash and seriously considered building only a basement on the steeply sloping st street site but in  the architect robert h robertson designed an ambitious new church which opened the next year robertson had become prominent in the ’s for his deft vigorous modeling of the romanesque style often in rockfaced brownstone for church and other designs including the young women’s christian association building at  east th street  apparently because of continuing financial difficulties st luke’s had to cut back on its plans leaving until a later time much of the stone carving and a tall square corner tower which was never built nyc chapter of the american guild of organists a remnant of st luke’s’ association with hamilton grange is the continued presence of william ordway partridge’s  portrait that formerly stood in front of the grange the space is now used as a community garden the work stood in front of the nowdefunct hamilton club of brooklyn at clinton and remsen streets until  when it was moved here it joined three other statues of hamilton on the island in central park on the columbia university campus a  replica of the partridge and in front of the museum of the city of new york george washington is the subject of  statues in manhattan abraham lincoln five four inscriptions appear on the pedestal “there is not in the constitution of the united states an element of force of order or of duration which he has not powerfully contributed to introduce and caused to predominate” —guizot “he smote the rock of national resources and abundant steams of revenue gushed forth” –webster “his rare powers entitle him to the fame of being the first intellectual product of america” –stevens “the name of hamilton would have honored greece in the age of aristides” –ames hamilton terrace is an outofthe way enclave running one block between west st and west th there are no intermediate streets east of convent avenue it was mostly developed between  but it also boasts the  ivey delph apartments developed by vertner tandy the first africanamerican architect registered in new york state what makes this little street so desirable like strivers row and convent avenue it has singlefamily rowhouses in excellent condition but unlike those areas it’s on an oddly placed street with little traffic giving it “a certain sense of exclusivity” says lisa silversmith who owns properties on both convent avenue and hamilton terrace it’s a peaceful enclave where residents know each other a sort

live in oakland forever  but am a ny boy brooklyn and queens have a great holiday season reply ron s says december   at  nice to see a successful preservation when i was at ccny  the grange was neglected and sad looking reply dave c says december   at  damn they just don’t build them like that anymore do they compare to a  family fedders special reply alc says december   at  hamilton is a very fascinating subject to study if you see the issues then you’ll see we have the same issues even now big govt vs small government reply sergey kadinsky says december   at  i passed by hamilton grange daily on my commute to ccny  it felt very cramped at its old location now it has room to stretch it’s interesting how its new placement clashes with the street grid probably intentional to remind that the home predates the grid reply tal barzilai says december   at  has anything been built on its previous location since it moved to where it is now reply kevin walsh says december   at  as it says on the page there is a community garden there now reply chris says december   at  hamilton’s son was killed in a duel  years earlier reply mark says december   at  there is a hamilton duel

place…it no longer exists since large sections of the palisades were quarried for granite over the years the quarry operations only stopped when the rockefeller family bought up large sections of the palisades and created what is today palisades interstate park the robberbarons of old had a sense of largess and duty toward the general public that is almost totally devoid in today’s wall st swindlers and banksters reply james says february   at  hamilton really asked for it and he sure got it bang reply anonymous says april   at  i remember when i was still in city college  how they moved the grange not from hamilton terrace but from convent and then down the hill on w  street it was a long process and when it finally opened just by happenstance i was there they reenacted how alexander hamilton and his wife would return home with actors a horsedrawn carriage and flute players they allowed tours inside and events for the kids in the park it’s good place to learn more about late th early th century american history…like how alexander hamilton was never president i felt so stupid and i’m usually good at history and i was taking usso at city college at the time too epic fail reply steventorrey says june   at  i just finished reading alexander hamilton american by richard brookhiser  an excellent read he has a several pictures of “the grange”  is a photo of “the grange” on convent avenue sandwiched between st luke’s and an apartment building it’s nice to see “the grange” restored to a way it might have looked when it was built in –even if in a different
