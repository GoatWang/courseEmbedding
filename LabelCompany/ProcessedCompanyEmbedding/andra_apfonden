investment rules asset management strategy holdings business control risk management result research guidelines private equity asset management over time the second ap fund deems that some  percent of its return derives entirely from market exposure of its strategic benchmark the remaining  percent being generated through active portfolio management the reason the second ap fund complements direct market exposure with active management derives from its brief to maximize return while maintaining a low level of risk this strategy is also based on the funds perception of how capital markets function and on the potential for generating portfolio returns this strategy has been formulated in a number of investments beliefs these describe the funds view of the way capital markets function and the opportunities presented for generating a return on investment these principles may be grouped under three main headings  the way the capital market functions in principle asset management offers two main ways of generating value the first is to establish an effective portfolio of asset classes that over time capture the risk premiums available on the financial markets the second is to practice active management the latter assumes an ability to locate temporary price inefficiencies based on the recognition that no market is entirely effectivethere is also fundamental consensus that share values over time tend to revert to their mean value and that longterm risk cannot be compared to shortterm risk trends the equity market in recent years are a case in point portfolio diversification by mixing assets and management strategies is thought to increase overall returns without raising the total level of risk in the funds portfolio  longterm thinking yields advantages as a longterm investor the second ap fund is better able to bear the risk arising from shortterm market fluctuations the funds brief also enables investment in a broader range of asset classes compared to other market players as investor the second ap fund is allowed to acquire illiquid assets diversifying risk while simultaneously offering expectations of a higher return furthermore longterm investment enables investors to practice active governance to add value to the portfolio  conditions for success the fund must consistently attract develop and retain competent staff exceptional

the pension system is likely to develop over the long term the assumptions made concerning demographic and general economic development are thereby decisive in determining the fund’s longterm investment focus the performance profiles of the investment assets the fund considers when composing its strategic benchmark are also highly significant the second ap fund’s alm analysis reveals that a relatively high longterm return is necessary if the goals established for its asset management activities are to be attained in practice therefore this means that a large part of the fund’s capital will be invested in highrisk assets such as equities and credit bonds given the present low interest rates the return on lowrisk assets – such as government securities – will not be adequate to attain the goals established for the fund’s investment activities recent years have typified the episodic progress that marks financial markets in the long term the second ap fund therefore seeks to increase the dynamic element in its strategic benchmark to adjust the level of risk adopted in relation to longterm market prospects portfolio diversification is a crucial factor in composing a strategic benchmark nevertheless a globalised economy and the closer integration of international financial markets make traditional diversification more problematic new sources of return may instead be found in investment areas that lie outside traditional quoted asset classes the second ap fund is engaged in an ongoing evaluation of opportunities for investing parts of the portfolio in such alternative
