you came if you know whence you came there is really no limit to where you can go james baldwin the fire next time  donna brazile al gores  presidential campaign manager and i ought to be friends but were not were about the same age were both proud african americans who are involved in public service and fascinated by the political arena both of us can lay claim to a few firsts  she is the first black woman presidential campaign manager and i am the first black to serve in the house republican leadership our upbringings are also surprisingly similar our fathers both did odd jobs and we were both raised on the poor side of the tracks growing up love was a lot easier to come by than money we both felt the sting of racism and exclusion and i suspect that she too was called nigger a few times as i was despite a less than easy road however each of us managed to graduate from college and go on to make our mark in politics and government yet with all that we share donna brazile decided to use me to play the race card in the  presidential campaign attacking my integrity my motives and my commitment to african american children she told a reporter the republicans bring out colin powell and jc watts because they have no program no policy they play that game because they have no other game they have no love and no joy theyd rather take pictures with black children than feed them i may have given up boxing years ago but telling a youth minister he doesnt care about his kids is fightin words no one likes to be on the receiving end of a partisan barrage but if i was going to get shot at i was glad colin powell was in the foxhole with me ive never met donna brazile she certainly doesnt know me or what motivates me maybe our paths will cross one day and ill get to ask her why she chose to single out general powell and me for what ive come to affectionately call the full donna but knowing her penchant for headlinemaking remarks it was an offhand comment that got her fired as michael dukakiss political director in  i found her intemperate comments hardly a surprise ms brazile is typical of many black leaders and political operatives today who simply cant accept the notion that there are independentminded african american men and women who disagree with them who have rejected their liberal philosophy and approach to problem solving for them group identity is more important than individual principles because for them maintaining the group identity assures the continuation of their power like any group that has endured much african americans have created a strong and mutually reinforcing sense of group identity thats not a bad thing in and of itself once the exhilaration of emancipation had worn off after the civil war and the reality of being free but black in america had sunk in that group identity comforted protected and encouraged us as a people to move forward in spite of the barriers put before our progress that group identity gave us new strength and courage during the civil rights movement of the s that ended the reign of jim crow and began a new era of black educational and economic upward mobility sometimes though this group identity can limit us more than it protects us just as the irish the italians and the jews still take pride in their roots african americans today should be proud of their heritage and never forget the difficult path our people have been forced to walk but when the group identity becomes more important than the individual it can blind us to valuable viewpoints options and opportunities i embrace my blackness just as i do my conservatism and my christianity but i dont want to be defined or pigeonholed by any one of the many elements that make up my character that refusal to be stereotyped and cast into certain beliefs and behaviors is what gets people of color who take another path particularly a conservative path into a heap of trouble it doesnt matter whether it is colin powell or condoleezza rice shelby steele thomas sowell clarence thomas or yours truly  we have all been labeled expedients uncle toms oreos sellouts traitors to our race and other equally uncomplimentary characterizations most of all however critics of black conservatives say weve forgotten where we came from i may forget a federal budget number or god forbid to set the alarm clock for my weekly  am flight to washington but i know exactly where i came from i know because every decision i make every day is based on the values and lessons i learned growing up on the poor side of the tracks in a dusty little oklahoma town that most people have never heard of and nobody can spell right the first time i like to call the ethos i grew up with oklahoma values but youd be just as accurate if you said american values except for our lack of a seacoast oklahoma has a little bit of just about everything thats american we call the southeastern corner little dixie because it touches arkansas and almost reaches louisiana the northern part of the state has a shared border with missouri and kansas the northwestern section is a gateway to colorado and new mexico and of course our entire southern boundary defines the northern edge of texas were southern and were western and great plains too every weekend when i fly home from washington i never get tired of seeing the beauty and bounty of my

speaker j c watts had star power when he took the oath of office as a member of the first republican majority in  years one of two black republicans in congress in his freshman term watts cited his humble roots in a segregated oklahoma farm town as the source of his belief in self–reliance and disdain of social welfare “i wasn’t raised to be a republican or democrat” watts recalled “my parents just taught by example they taught me and my brothers and sisters that if you lived under their roof you were going to work” watts quickly became one of the gop’s most visible spokesmen quickly rising to the position of republican conference chair—the fourth–highest–ranking republican in the house his uneasy relationship with party leaders and a desire to spend more time with his family cut short watts’s capitol hill career in its primejulius caesar j c watts jr was born in the farming community of eufaula oklahoma on november   his mother helen watts a homemaker raised six children melvin lawrence mildred gwen j c and darlene watts’s father julius caesar buddy watts was a police officer a businessman and a minister the elder watts also served on the eufaula city council and along with his brother wade was active in the democratic party and the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp wade watts headed the oklahoma branch of the naacp for  years j c watts was one of the first black children to attend a previously all–white elementary school in eufaula at eufaula high school watts was the first african–american quarterback for the school’s football team some of watts’s teammates from the mostly segregated local community protested at first while in high school watts fathered two daughters with two different women one child tia was adopted by watt’s uncle wade watts married his other daughter’s mother frankie jones whom he first met at his seventh birthday party the couple raised five children lakesha jerrell jennifer julia and treyafter graduating in  watts played football and studied journalism at the university of oklahoma in norman at first he was a seventh–string quarterback discouraged with his minimal playing time he left school multiple times in each instance his father persuaded him to return in  watts became the starting quarterback and led the sooners to orange bowl victories in  and  he was named the bowl’s most valuable player both years and he was inducted into the orange bowl hall of fame in  watts’s athletic prowess provided him with motivational speaking opportunities while he was in collegefollowing watts’s graduation in  the new york jets a national football league nfl team offered him a place on their roster but it was not in his favorite position as quarterback watts turned down the nfl offer and played from  to  in the canadian football league cfl watts then returned to oklahoma to become a youth minister at sunnyvale baptist church in del city oklahoma ordained in  he supplemented his ministerial income by opening his own highway construction company his discontent with government regulation of his business led him to contemplate running for officedespite the watts family’s long–standing public support for the democratic party—buddy watts once quipped that “a black man voting for the republicans makes about as much sense as a chicken voting for colonel sanders”—j c watts subscribed to the republican message of social and fiscal conservatism he first considered changing his party allegiance when he covered a  oklahoma senate campaign as a journalism student and found that his views were more in line with those of the republican candidate don nickles he officially changed his party affiliation in  “i switched my registration not out of convenience but out of conviction” watts later recalled “i knew what i was doing would not be popular it created some strain even in relationships i had built over the years but i knew in my heart that this was the right road the honest road for me to take and remain true to my own principles” in  watts ran for a seat on the oklahoma corporation commission an organization that regulated the state’s telephone oil and gas industries with oklahoma party loyalty tending to split along racial lines officials in the state republican party eagerly embraced watts he won a seat on the commission serving as chairman from  until his departure in in  seven–term representative dave mccurdy of oklahoma announced that he was running for the us senate and local republican businessmen urged watts to run for mccurdy’s seat mccurdy represented a conservative southwest oklahoma district with several oil reserves and three major military installations agriculture was also a major industry and the district included the university of oklahoma in norman watts entered the primary as a “textbook conservative” he favored the death penalty school prayer a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform he also opposed abortion and cuts in defense spendingwatts faced a tough august primary challenge against state representative ed apple winning  percent to apple’s  percent however state law required a runoff primary if no candidate won more than  percent of the vote in preparation for the september contest watts brought in high–powered republicans to campaign for him including new york representative jack kemp a football star and national rifle association spokesman and actor charlton heston watts also secured the endorsement of the house republican leadership apple lambasted watts’s courting of out–of–state luminaries comparing his local campaign to watts’s star–power support he declared “it’s grassroots vs glitz” the runoff remained close but watts prevailed with  percent of the votewatts continued to host high–profile republicans for his general election campaign including former president george h w bush kansas senator bob dole and future republican speaker then republican whip newt gingrich of georgia he and his democratic opponent local attorney david perryman a self–described conservative soon found themselves in a close heated campaign in an attempt to appeal to the district’s conservative farming voters perryman launched an advertisement depicting watts with his afro hairstyle in high school juxtaposed against images of himself as a teenager posing with his prize–winning pigs the advertisement’s racial overtones attracted national attention and perryman offered to change the photograph of watts in the advertisement watts’s firm conservative platform and his popularity among oklahoma sooners fans prevailed he defeated perryman and independent candidate bill tiffee with  percent of the votewatts’s victory established several milestones he was the first black representative elected from oklahoma and the first republican to win the district in  years he was sworn in to the th congress – as part of the gop national tide putting the party in power in the house for the first time in  years watts increased his victories in his next three re–election campaigns winning by as much as  percent in  he received assignments on the banking and financial services committee and national security committee later renamed armed services the latter panel was crucial to the oversight of the three military installations in his district watts left the banking and financial services committee for a spot on the transportation and infrastructure committee in the th congress – in the th congress – he turned down a position on the prestigious appropriations committee when a seat opened midterm he did not want to leave the transportation committee the gop hoped that watts as one of two black republicans in the house representative gary franks was also re–elected to a connecticut district would court african–american voters who overwhelmingly voted democratic in national elections watts focused on promoting the gop through black organizations he often attended naacp meetings and met with representatives from historically black colleges “most black people don’t think alike most black people just vote alike” he argued “why is it that so many people in the black community who would agree with republican issues why don’t they vote republican i think that’s the question we have to ask” however watts stressed that he represented his district rather than strictly his race “my father raised me to be a man not a black man” watts declared “i am black but that’s not all of who i am” he later added accordingly watts declined an invitation to join the traditionally liberal congressional black caucus cbc “i think the cbc and i want the same things for the black community” he mused “the difference is how we get there”representative watts supported a fiscally conservative agenda voting  percent of the time for legislative initiatives from the contract with america a  republican campaign promise to limit government spending and corruption watts’s legislative emphasis was based on his belief that public assistance programs encouraged dependency in poor minorities in  watts teamed with representative jim talent of missouri to create the renewal community project legislation that provided tax breaks and the deregulation of small businesses school vouchers allowing parents to choose their children’s schools and funding for faith–based organizations assisting low–income communities in  watts reintroduced the legislation as the american community renewal act adding tax cuts for low–income communities as well as opportunities for home ownership the new legislation also eliminated the capital gains tax and provided a “wage credit” for businesses that hired qualified low–income employees watts’s goal was to help low–income families save money “under the current tax system we penalize savings and investment and productivity” he argued “those are three things we should be rewarding” the legislation gained bipartisan support president william j bill clinton’s administration supported the measure and speaker dennis hastert dubbed the bill among the gop’s top three priorities for the second session of the th congress – the legislation was signed into law in december though watts embraced his role as a conservative he attempted to remain outside the debate on affirmative action “affirmative action isn’t the problem” watts argued “lousy education for black kids is the problem until you fix these schools don’t talk to me about equal opportunity” watts’s personal experience with continued racism led him to believe the united states was not ready to abolish preferences for minorities and watts opposed a bill submitted by fellow black republican gary franks of connecticut and florida republican charles canady in the th congress to eliminate affirmative action practices in the federal government as the bill gained momentum in the republican house watts appealed directly to speaker newt gingrich to block it “look in principle i don’t agree with affirmative action” he told gingrich “but in practice we still don’t have a level playing field” an emotional watts admitted to the speaker that he was “thinking with my heart here not my head” sympathetic to watts’s position the speaker arranged for the bill to die in the judiciary committeerepresentative watts’s ability to draw national attention earned him a reputation as the gop’s “great black hope” in  the republican party tapped him to deliver the gop response to president clinton’s state of the union address he was the youngest representative and the first african american to be accorded this honor watts’s response was generally well received he spoke about reducing the role of government in american lives “government can’t ease all pain in fact government sometimes rubs the wound raw and makes healing harder” he argued “i’m afraid that when the clinton administration and others talk about race it sounds to me like the same old same old—a bunch of sermons and sloganizing that defends the old assumption that government can heal the racial divide” watts concluded that the gop’s “mission is to return power to your home to where mothers and fathers can exercise it according to their beliefs” watts was rumored as a possible vice presidential candidate in  serving as co–chairman for gop presidential candidate bob dole former representative kemp eventually received the vice presidential nominationin  watts capitalized on a gop conference roiled by a poor showing in the midterm elections to challenge incumbent conference chairman john boehner of ohio though republicans had maintained their majority exit polls showed high african–american voter turnout in the south the gop’s stronghold and only  percent of these black americans voted republican—down from  percent in  though he claimed he was not running as a black candidate watts emphasized the gop’s need for broader appeal to minorities in a letter to house republicans he wrote “it is time to let the american people know that the republican party is the party of all americans we are the party of inclusiveness our ideas are good for everyone” supporters emphasized watts’s strong oratorical skills noting that the gop lacked a charismatic spokesperson on watts’s st birthday november   he prevailed against boehner  to  in the race for chairman of the house republican conference the gop’s fourth highest position in the house watts was the first african american to join the republican leadership and was subsequently re–elected to the position for the th congress –however watts’s tenure in the leadership proved difficult despite his elevated post watts often felt alienated by gop decision makers he also found himself at odds with powerful republican whip tom delay of texas watts disagreed with delay’s often forceful leadership as a result the gop whip’s hands–on approach to gathering votes and maintaining party unity often overstepped watts’s role as the hub for communication within the gop conference in july  watts threatened to resign from his leadership position to protest delay’s alleged encroachment on his duties but he stopped short of doing so when majority leader dick armey of texas announced his retirement in  watts considered running to replace him and he quietly solicited the aid of congressional allies
