factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and

also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting

business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if you increase

retirementannuity edu’s summary on the national western life ultra classic  equity indexed annuityoverall national western life ultra classic  equity indexed annuity has a long surrender charge relative to the potential for interest gains  the longer you’re locking into an annuity the more potential for growth there should be it’s similar to the concept of risk versus reward the more risk the more reward there is the longer the time of your commitment the higher the upside should be for you with annuities national western life ultra classic  equity indexed annuity does not have a favorable risk relative to reward in my opinion there are plenty of  year annuities that have more interest potential what this tells me is there’s no good reason to lock yourself in for  yearsto concludelocking yourself in a low interest annuity for  years may be good for your agent but not for you the fact that national western life doesn’t show projected returns concerns me makes me think they have something to hide this could allow agents to misrepresent the potential returns that are likely please compare the above analysis with what you’ve been tolddo you have any questions

continued emphasis on providing quality products and excellent service the company looks forward to celebrating many more milestones in the years to come     does the midland national endeavor  annuity really earn  guaranteed growth with the income riderthe income base of the midland national endeavor  annuity guarantees to increase by  every year you delay taking incomewait…did you say  guaranteed sign me up hold on it’s not really earning  guaranteedwhile this guaranteed amount of increase can seem tempting understand how it fits into your financial plan and what is the return it truly addswhat i mean is even though it increases  every year it’s only after you lose  of annual income first every year we all get  year closer to passing away so the insurance companies are using mortality tables to determine that their promise to pay us is getting less every year so they’ll guarantee  more for every year we don’t take incomebefore you make a longterm decision understand  guaranteed increase is in income base which is money you can’t just walk away with nor money your beneficiaries get or go make another investment with or spend at once and not even in a few years you must take income with the specified withdrawal rate in the contract what is the real return that  gives you i’ll break down the significant aspects you need to knowlet’s break down an example so you can understand how the income rider workslet’s assume you’re age  years old and you’re going to invest  you plan to defer the midland national endeavor  annuity for  years while it increases  each year with the guaranteed income rider on the beginning of the th year you begin to pull lifetime income at that point your guaranteed minimum income value is  and you’re lifetime payment percentage of  for life this equates to  annually therefore by the time you’re  you’ve pulled  in income at this point you’re above the average life expectancy you’ve withdrawn  above your initial investment of  which is a total return of  in  years this is under  compounded annually  this shows that you really didn’t earn  in those yearsunderstanding the surrender chargecontract yearwithdrawal chargedoes this match up to what you’ve been toldit’s important to compare the opportunity cost of utilizing other assets to satisfy income needs in the years you are deferring you or your adviser may be selling the wrong assets first in retirement based on the wrong return assumptions for example if you truly believe that this midland national endeavor  annuity is earning  you may defer it for a long time and sell assets that are truly earnings  real rate of return this can damage your ability to maintain your lifestyle in retirement and may be forced to downsize has your adviser understood the internal rate of return these annuity guarantees provide it’s typically less then  ask and double check before investing it’s something we do free at annuityedu if you’d like us to calculate the true rate of return just reach out and asknow that we’ve learned how the income rider works for midland national endeavor what type of performance can i expect from the optionsnote that rates may change

growth you need to maintain your lifestyle you’ll be disappointed  remember the  growth depends on your specific model and year you bought it’s not money you can walk away with but is guaranteed increase in your income value  let’s break down the numbers  scenario lets assume you’re age  put this annuity in and you plan to defer for  years until age  and then begin taking withdrawals or “income” remember the withdrawals are reductions of principal and any gains for the year if any this is not interest there’s a difference  you put  in this annuity after deferring it for  years your income base value has increased to  million and now want to begin taking income at age  in this example the person is guaranteed  withdrawal for the rest of their life which is  after withdrawing  for  years they’re now age   they’ve received total payments of   x  years  this means they’ve earned  from their income rider in  years  they put in  million and received a  this is less than  annually often times they’ll illustrate performance from  which is biased the late ’s and ’s had some of the best performance in stock market history if this performance isn’t repeated the

choose from and does not limit you this is definitely a strong point on this variable annuity this is good for investors the potential problem to consider is investing too conservatively inside this model  especially when choosing the income rider the higher fees and lower returns more conservative allocations can make it’s likely that the returns you experience will not keep up with inflationan important aspect about this jackson perspective ii annuity for fixed income allocationwhat are some of the benefits of the jackson national perspective ii with lifeguard freedom rider  annuitythe benefits of the base annuity mortality and expense charge also known as me of  and administration charge of   this means that the total cost of the perspective ii without the freedom flex rider are  annually the lifeguard freedom flex that adds the  rollup add an additional   that brings the expenses up to  annually but we haven’t discussed the fee’s inside the funds the funds have expenses ranging from  to a maximum of   if we assume an average expense of  for the funds that brings the total expenses for the annuity up to  annually it’s for this reason to make sure that this annuity is appropriate for you before buying it can be hard for an account to perform with a  drag on it  also note that jackson national has the option to increase the fee on the rider up to  annually from   at the higher rider expense total expenses would be approximately  annuallyare you considering a conservative moderate or balanced allocation within the annuity with the lifeguard freedom flex if so this is a mustread section due to the high fee’s it’ll be difficult to make money in the conservative allocation especially with the rider if growing your capital base is important to you while taking income then continue reading interest rates are low if your fixed income portfolio is earning  but paying over  in fee’s you’ll be losing  in that portfolio of your retirement investors might do this to reduce volatility but you  want to ask yourself if you’d prefer to lose  on that portion maintain a longterm view and knowing that the guarantees of the annuity are there in the worstcase scenariothe fixed income portion losses will affect the total performance in a negative way current aggregate bond index is earning around   we’re not sure how long rates will stay this low so it’s something to consider especially if you want to grow your principal it’s for this reason this annuity will likely perform best when weighted more aggressively in equities while having more money in equities can create more volatility the income rider guarantee is most valuable when invested more aggressivelythe jackson lifeguard freedom flex  isn’t as valuable when invested more conservatively  if we’re going to have a feature that’s costing you money but it guarantees you lifetime income your minus will grow  if the stock market were to experience a great depression loss of  and didn’t recover for a long period of time that income rider would help dramatically so it’s up to your investment to make up for the fees and go for the upside while you can the income riders’ value comes in

to maintain your lifestyle” this is what retirement planning annuity analysis is all about  if you have an agent who’s telling you that this annuity is earning  guaranteed you need to understand the truth my goal is to help you understand more about the details and exactly what you can expect so you can see deeper into an overly simplified sales pitchthe questions a retiree should be asking themselves arehow does this  guaranteed growth for prosperity elite fixed indexed annuity benefit my financial plan what’s the real rate of return that it adds to my family the income rider for the fidelity  guaranty life prosperity elite  has a cost of  annually this is currently around  of cap rates in other words the fee is  of upside you’ll get so this is something important we’ll consider whether the fee is worth the benefitthe income rider offers a  compounded return to guaranteed withdrawal value  guaranteed growth not so fast this is not money you can just walk away with but you must withdrawal according the annuities rules   if the fg guaranteed income rider really isn’t earning  what return is it earninglet’s breakdown the numbers you need to know we’ll start looking at the guaranteed income portion then we’ll look at the accumulation value investment options we’ll use an example of a yearold male utilizing a joint income rider benefit for his yearold wife  he’s been told by his agent that he’s going to get an  bonus and  guaranteed growth of his income base for the first  years before he takes income his goal is take lifetime guaranteed in year  he makes a premium payment of  in year one  immediately his gmwb income base value increases  to  by the time year  when he wants to begin withdrawing his income base is up   this allows him to begin withdrawing  for him and his wife guaranteed for the rest of your lifewhat does all this mean to youafter  years of deferring the fg elite pro annuity and after  years of withdrawing  of lifetime annual income we’ve now owned this annuity for  years and have received a total of  in lifetime payments this means that you haven’t made a positive return after  years but you have paid around  in fees  at this point you’re  years old and past the average life expectancy i figured the  in fees by calculating the  fee multiplied by  years understand what the insurance companies are doing when they offer you to delay your payments for your future  increases in income base value they’re looking at life expediencies and they know that their promise to pay you is getting less from a mortality standpoint it’s not always best to defer and these annuities are earning nowhere near the  guaranteed growth  if we haven’t made any money in the st  years when do we make money and do we ever earn  is a common question we often get here at annuityeducomafter withdrawing guaranteed lifetime for  years you’ve received  with a deposit of   at this point you’re  years old have earned a total return of   this is an average annual return of under  compounded per year  nowhere near the  guaranteed that they make it seem  so if you have an agent that’s telling otherwise you may need a new advisor  if you understand the numbers and can afford this low a return in retirement then this annuity may be good for you      what about the the fidelity  guaranty life prosperity elite series index option performancefidelity  guaranty life prosperity elite series has very weak performance according to the current cap rates you should not expect to earn more than  annually and likely lessfg elite index option with capssp  year monthly average with cap   current cap      sp  year annual point to point with cap  current cap gold annual point to point    sp  year monthly point to point with  cap current cap sp  year fixed declared rate on index gain  the annual point to point with a cap is the most common and easiest to understand method  the highest this strategy would’ve returned over the last  years would’ve been  annually that was   if you’re expecting and needing higher returns in retirement then you  may want to reconsider utilizing this annuity      where it works bestproducing a pension like lifetime guaranteed income stream with the income rider those looking to earn less then  on their capital who want to make sure they never lose their principal and will to accept safety over return where it works worstlooking for moderate to maximum growth who need a return on their investment in the first decade of retirement if using income rider those who need a return of over  annually in retirement to maintain their lifestyleto concludeoverall fidelity  guaranty life prosperity elite series has more bad features then good ones in my opinion  the cap are and index return are extremely low  the attempts to make up for it with  bonus but the returns are to slow still for most investor’s needs the fidelity  guaranty life prosperity elite series annuity comes in  different surrender charges   and  year this review was on the  year but they’re all pretty similar what concerns me is the low internal rate of return and i feel many agents and retiree’s may think that they’re really earning a  return when they’re not  if you think you’re earning  but you’re really not this can having horrific consequences to the your retirement success and may cause a premature depletion of your capital and purchasing power in order to avoid this it’s important to test this annuity versus various others to see which one fits your goals and objectives the most  this

especially if you have too much of your nest egg tied up it’ll be like running with huge weight tied to you     let’s see if it the benefits that it might provide are worth the higher feescontract yearthereafterwithdrawal chargeare you considering a conservative or moderate allocation within the annuityan important aspect about this aig polaris platinum iii annuity for fixed income allocation’sconservative or moderate allocations have a high percentage in bonds with rates so low the fixed income portion of the portfolio will be losing money for example the aggregate bond index is currently yielding  if the fees are  then you’ll be using the interest to pay the annuities fees in other words aig and your advisor will be making more money on the bonds then you will yes high yield bonds can earn more than  but odds are high yield bonds won’t make up that large of a percentage of your portfolio for this reason it makes more sense to have a higher equity allocationif you’re extremely conservative and even with the annuities guarantees you want to be in bonds then the rider fee’s will eat away on your interest and you may want to consider taking a long term view and accepting more volatility in order to get your money’s worth this annuity does have a good option to maintain the equity exposure while having the living benefits which is a big pluswhat are some of the benefits of the aig polaris annuitythe benefits of the base annuity mortality and expense charge also known as me of  allow you to switch around with multiple money managers at no cost the base also gives you the tax deferral of an annuity  if you’re in a tax sheltered account already then this doesn’t give you any benefit the annuity has b shares which add another  in fees the aig polaris annuity already has  in annual fee’s without the rider the lifetime income rider adds an additional  for the single life option and  for the joint income life option these can change up to a maximum  for single life and  for joint life the base annuity is expensive and if you’re looking for growth the fees will weigh you down let’s look at the annuity’s income rider which is where things get more

for growthgetting tax deferred accumulationguaranteed lifetime incomethis national western life annuity income outlook plus  strength as with most annuities comes in guaranteeing lifetime income  national western life insurance company is saying that for every year you get older and don’t take income they’ll give you  more in other words every year you lose  in income and according to their life expectancy tables their promise to pay you income for your  lifetime is getting less due to you getting older their willing to give you  more the question is how much is the  rider really worth and is worth it for you throughout the rest of the review we’ll go through some factors you should consider when answering that questionwhat is the national western life annuity income outlook plus  surrender schedulecontract yearthereafterwithdrawal chargehow much does the national western life nwl  rider cost as you can see the national western life is a  year commitment it’s important to understand all the details before you buy because it has a very unforgiving surrender schedulethe annual cost of the rider is  if your account value is  but your income value  the fee is  of your income benefit account which is around  of the account value  it’s important to note that this will make it very difficult for the account value to grow especially while taking withdrawals     as a principal protected way to get up capped market growthnational western life annuity income outlook plus  can help you get growth with principal protection it’s important to note however that it’s not the same as being in the market as far the upside i’ll walk you through the expected return by looking at the rates this annuity has some of the most complex and confusing crediting methods that i’ve seen on an annuity to make things worse the company doesn’t show any historical performance of the crediting methods making it very difficult to see what we can expectthere are  different index crediting optionswith this national western life annuity income outlook plus  the first year participation rates will higher then ongoing participation rates for example current st year participation rates are  for option a and  for option koption a –indexed interest rate annual rachet with monthly average  any indexed interest earned is calculated from the beginning index value for each policy year whether higher or lower than the previous year  all indexed interest is credited annually on the policy anniversary and lockedin  future decrease in the index alone with reduce your financial lowoption b –fixed rate—this is similar to fixed annuity but it can float and adjust if rates go up or down check your current rate sheet for up to date informationoption c –indexed interest rate—annual rachet with monthly capoption k –interest on the account value is linked in part to the sp composite stock index the nikkei  index and eurostoxx index this can change subject to participation ratesunderstanding the income outlook plus  rider and the  compounded growth rate  guaranteed return sign me up  not so fastit’s important to understand the rate of return this provides to your financial plan when analyzing whether the income outlook rider is appropriate in helping you reach your financial goals  to see through the smoke and mirrors it’s important to test this annuity versus others for the internal rate of return that it provides to youthe way national western life gives you  every year you don’t take income is based on mortality tables they know that every year you don’t take income is a year that their promise to pay your lifetime income is getting less so they’re willing to give you  additional in years that you do take income because they know they’ll on average be required to give you income for less yearsthe insurance companies are smart and they know their numbers so it’s important to analyze all your options and know your numbers  you can do this by testing the annuity for the internal rate of return so you can make the smartest decision to see if the numbers will provide for you in your financial planscenario here’s and example to explain what i mean let’s assume you’re age  and you put  into this national western life impact  annuity with income outlook plus  in the st year you’ll receive a  bonus and at the end of year  year  your benefit base will be  allowing you an annual income of  for life this means by year  you’ve taken  in income by the time you’re  you haven’t made a positive return on the income feature yet   age  is also above the life expectancy assuming you live to  you’ll receive total payments of  over  years this is a return of  over  yearsjust using simple return that’s a simple annual return of  which is much less than the  that most agents make it seem you’re getting  the compounded rate of return on that scenario which gives us much more realistic returns when comparing against other alternatives is  annually much less then the smoke and mirrors scenario another example we can use is if you’re  and let it defer for  years until age  by the time you’ve decided to take income the income value will be around   at age  you can take  withdrawals which are equal to  if you take income for the next  years until age  years old you’ll receive total income of  by then you’ve earned  over a period of  years which is under  compounded annually i don’t think agents fully understand these irr numbers that you’re reading it’s a lot easier for them to state the big numbers like  compounded growth and  withdrawal and hope nobody like me does the math so did you really make  guaranteed in those years definitely notthe longer you live the higher the return you can make but are you confident that you can afford to make no return in retirement for the first  yearsnational western life income outlook plus  annuity may still have a role but if you’re counting on the  income rider to help you hit the  return goal that you need you may want to look elsewhere test this annuity as part of your retirement income plan to see if it can help you reach your goals often an agent may not realize what i’ve just explained to you consider that if you pass away your beneficiaries don’t get the income base value that increases by  annually they may be able to get the joint income value  compare this money with other safe alternatives     where it works bestfor producing a pension like lifetime guaranteed income stream with the income riderfor those looking for a conservative growth and want to

it makes me uneasy that the company doesn’t show historical performance also the crediting methods are much more confusing than most annuities other companies i’ve seen do show historical performance so i don’t think it’s a legal or compliance issue  it makes me think why don’t they want to show performance what do they have to hiderelative to many annuities on the market the year surrender is standard national western life has a high amount of income relative to other carriers especially with the bonus but overall the internal rate of return is still very lowthis annuity is best for

the companies they’ve acquired has a proven track record of serving customers for more than  yearsthis annuity can be broken down into  parts the base annuity and the base annuity with the guaranteed

or higher than this exact modelthe investment options and potential growth for the athene ascent annuitydoes the athene ascent annuity really earn  guaranteed growth with the income riderthe income base of the annuity is guaranteed to increase by  every year you delay taking income for the st  years after the first  years it increases by  from then on wait…did you say  guaranteed sign me up hold on it’s not really earning  guaranteed while this guaranteed amount of increase can seem tempting understand how it fits into your financial plan and what is the return it adds also if that return is sufficient to have your money last through your retirementwhat i mean is even though it increases  every year it’s only after you lose  of annual income first every year we all get  year closer to passing away so the insurance companies are using mortality tables to determine that their promise to pay us is getting less every year so they’ll guarantee  more for every year we don’t take incomebefore making a longterm decision understand  guaranteed increase is in income base which is money you can’t just walk away with and not money your beneficiaries get or go make another investment with or spend at once and not even in a few years you must take income with the specified withdrawal rate in the contract what is the real return that  gives you i’ll break down the significant aspects you need to knowscenario in this example a male age  invests  in the athene ascent  bonus  fixed indexed annuity and plans to defer it until age  when he retires  annual guaranteed roll up will be credited to him at age  his account has an income guarantee of  and his lifetime withdrawal rate of that value is  this guarantees him  or  annually for the rest of his life that’s the way he must access the  he cannot take a lump sum of that after taking lifetime income for  years and owning the annuity for  years he has received  total from his annuity  years this is under  annually compounded return still confused i’m going to break this down further so you can see just what i mean and make the best decision for you not your agenta common question i often get is “if i don’t earn  per year what return does the  guaranteed rider earn me”this is the best way to help you understand lets say you just took income right away from this annuity and don’t earn the  guaranteed “return” or increase in income value  at age  you would be guaranteed a  rate withdrawal rate and an account value of  with the  bonus give you a  annually for life after  years you’ve received  back therefore after  years from your deposit you’ve received  income hence you’re age  after receiving income  yearsin comparison to when the deferring it for  years income increasing by the   you received  back so the defer for longer scenario yielded approximately  total income spread over a  year period this is much lower then the  implied growth from the  years of a  guaranteed increaseif you were to live male life expectancy however and do the first  years on the  year deferral scenario then you’ll receive  in total income which is around a  total additional return against a  implied  years of returndoes this match up to what you’ve been toldit’s  extremely important to also compare the opportunity cost of utilizing other assets to satisfy income needs in the years you are deferring if the wrong return assumptions are utilized you or your adviser may be selling the wrong assets first in retirement based on the wrong return assumptions  for example if you truly believe that this annuity is earning  you may defer this annuity for a very long time and sell assets that are truly earnings  to   real rate of return  this can be very damaging to your ability to maintain your lifestyle in retirement and you may be forced to downsize does your adviser understand  this concept  you might want to ask and double check before investingdoes the athene ascent  bonus  fixed indexed annuity inflation adjusted income really keep up with inflationthe problem with the inflation adjustment is that you start off lower than if you didn’t choose the inflation adjustment for example utilizing the same scenario as above you would start income at age  at  annually and it would take you over  years of  growth to receive the  you would’ve received day one without inflationcolamany of the pensions for government employees have cola’s this stands for cost of living adjustment and increases by  annually having a cola is a huge advantage and increases the total return of the annuity over the full retirement period dramatically unfortunately this annuity won’t do that because it starts off so lowathene ascent  bonus  fixed indexed annuity once you begin taking income will have a very low probability of ever increasing to keep up with inflation so if you’ve heard differently you may want to reconsider where you’re getting advice in order to do that rate of return in the investment account would have to consistently outperform the withdrawal rate  and that’s never happened this isn’t to say if you really understand how athene ascent annuity works and accept that it will perform in this way but want to make sure you know and can afford to have this low of a return in much of their assets which most retirees can’t can you afford that low of a return and still maintain your lifestyle in retirement the only way to tell is run the numbers test your annuity and how it behaves in your financial plannow that we understand how the guaranteed income rider works we’ll talk about how the nonguaranteed parts of the annuity work and their historical performance investment options will determine your account values performance this is considered the “walk away” portion of your annuity what type of performance can i expect from the optionsnote that rates may change so the rates we discuss here may be higher or lower then the rates discussed below due to the potential of changing participation ratesthe investment indexes arethe bnp  year point to point is the one with the highest historical performance since it has no cap your agent may brag about the high performance potential the bnp historical average index return  with  participation rate is  for the lowest  yearsthe annually interest rate for the most recent  years period was   annuallythe bnp   annual return for the best  years was  annuallythis is not bad considering interests rates are low but if our expecting high stock market returns you’ll be disappointed this annuities performance is closer with the performance of bonds then stocks it also has much less downside risk and volatility then stocksathene ascent enhanced incomeunderstanding the athene ascent enhanced income is important before deciding i feel this aspect is often misunderstood and misrepresented i’ll help you understand the truth so you can compare against what you’ve been told income benefit ak ca ct dc hi nj paut wato qualify for the enhanced income benefit after a one year waiting period the persons for whom lifetime income withdrawals are based must be confined to qualified care facility for  out of the last  days if qualifications are met the lifetime income withdrawal amount will be doubled the enhanced benefit limit period is  months as long as the

since inception net of all the fees me and single securesource  rider feesspso if your advisor claims that you’ll get market like returns you may need to find a new advisor because they’re not being honest of course we don’t know how the funds will perform over the full market cycle past performance is no guarantee of future results however so far it’s track record in catching market upside has been horribleadditionally…another concern for me about the portfolio stabilizer funds with the riders fee’s is on the more conservative options such as moderate and conservative have bond allocations of anywhere from  with bond yields currently at record lows and with us being unsure of when rates will normalize the fee’s will eat up any interest from the bonds you receive until rates rise substantially that’s something to keep in mind before you purchase this annuity especially if you’re going to select a more conservative option for example the barclays bond index  is yielding  all in fee’s for the annuity with securesource single are around  depending on which surrender schedule with fee’s that are higher then your fixed income it’s difficult to make returns in fact riversource

would like — after the year waiting period you can choose to take withdrawals create an income stream or get full access to your moneysecure sourcethe part they don’t mention in this pitch is that you have to invest in one of the portfolio stabilizer funds if an advisor tells you that you can have pure stock market like returns with no risk then i think that’s misleading you may want to reconsider your advisor if you skipped over my explanation in the securesource section about the portfolio stabilizer funds please read my explanation under the securesource rider in regards to the stabilizer funds it’s just as important for those who are going to invest in the apb to understand how the portfolio stabilizer funds work and the fee’s associated with it      where it works bestfor producing a

one of the guaranteed riders such as guaranteed accumulation or secure sourcefor those looking to keep more of what they earn by keeping fee’s low for maximum long term growthoverall i think riversource annuity rava  advantage has some good features and some bad ones the base annuity without the riders is relatively low cost compared to other annuities in it’s class what concerns me is the low performance portfolio stabilizer funds that are required if you choose one of the riders buying an annuity is a long term commitment you should test riversource annuity rava  advantage versus

current participation rates at  these are subject to change so please see current participation rates before making a decision this means you’ll receive  of whatever the sp  volatility index  does for that year with zero downside the sp volatility index has a lot less upside then the sp on top of that you’re getting a participation rate which gives you a percentage of the upside of the risk controlled indexsp index risk control index  indexassuming the  participation rate this index has averaged  since  this index however can have large up years when the market performs well especially when compared to the safety of no downside risk  in  when the sp volatility index  increased  great american annuity would’ve credited  so it can have large up years however even with that large year it still has averaged  which is less then average bond portfolio during the same period yet still much more then cash or cd’ssp index annual pointtpoint with capassuming the current  cap   caps and

of return this provides to your financial plan when analyzing whether the incomesecure rider is appropriate in helping you reach your financial goals  in order to do this it’s important to test this annuity versus others for the internal rate of return that it provides to youthe way great american annuity – american legend iii gives you  every year you don’t take income is based on mortality tables   they know that every year you don’t take income is a year that their promise to pay you lifetime income is getting less so they’re willing to give you  additional in years that you do take income because they know they’ll on average be required to give you income for less years   the insurance companies are smart so it’s important to analyze all your options and test the annuity for the internal rate of return so you can make the smartest decision for you and your retirement and not the insurance companiesscenario let’s assume you’re age  and put  into this great american annuity with the incomesecure  rider and want to begin taking income in the th year by then your  has growth by  simple to  in the income base your lifetime withdrawals at age  are  annually the  is a  withdrawal rate of  by the time you turn  after taking income for  years you have received  so you haven’t received your investment back yet note that if you’re a male the average life expectancy is  and if you’re a female it’s  many of you reading this will have passed away before making a returnthis is what the insurance company is counting on and why they are able to give you  income increase every year you don’t take income you don’t start making a return on your investment until year  in which you’ve received  in total income which is a  total gain over  years which is less then  annual interest yes that’s less than  of  annually so did you really make  guaranteed in those yearsof course not  the longer you live the higher the return you can make but are you confident that you can afford to make no return in retirement for the first  years  this annuity may still have a role but if you’re counting on the  income rider to help you hit the  return goal that you need you may want to look elsewhereit’s important to test this annuity as part of your retirement income plan to see if it can help you reach your goals often times an agent may not realize what i’ve just explained to you so if he doesn’t make sure you get an analysis done so you can make the best decisiondeath benefitanother aspect of this is that if you pass away your beneficiaries don’t get the income base value that increases by  annually  if that’s important to you you may want to look at the other income riders incomesecure plus and inheritance enhancer which do offer enhanced death benefit features great american does have some of the best death benefit features i’ve seen in the market this can be valuable because that really helps increase the potential guaranteed internal rate of return to your heirs especially if that’s one of your priority’s with the money you are thinking about putting inside this annuity when compared to other safe alternativesthis rider costs  annually  it’s important to analyze whether this rider makes sense for you  if your looking for growth and you average  in your index credit this rider will cost you over  of your growth so be sure to see if the income rider is best for your goals income credits cannot increase the income base more than the income rollup cap of  and remember every year you don’t take income their promise to pay is less      where it works

good track record great american annuity – american legend iii is best for conservative growth and for guaranteeing lifetime income that you can’t outlive no matter how long you live furthermore it should outperform cash and perform similar to conservative bonds in the current low rate environment in my viewalso can help minimize volatility of your overall asset allocation what concerns me is

riskcreate a lifetime guaranteed income that can increase over timeto get a  bonus to the income value and  bonus’s on interest earnedthe best part about this annuity is…for you to truly be able to

lot of potential the guarantee’s are weaker than most annuities but for those looking for upside income potential with a downside floor then this may be your annuity another part that’s unique is that the protected income value is available as a death benefit at no additional cost    this annuity is  a long term commitment with high penalties if you take you’re money out earlythe penalties are belowcontract yearwithdrawal chargewhat are the minimum guarantees for the allianz  annuity this is where this annuity is weakest   it doesn’t have a “guaranteed” increase like some other annuities in the market place  if a  year old male differed the annuity for  years and received no interest credits his guaranteed income in year  would be  annually for life  this is a very unlikely scenario but it shows that there’s no guaranteed increase    this guaranteed increase is offset by the special way in which the income increases work  unlike most annuities you’re able to get an increase income even if the accumulation value doesn’t increase above the income value  this has the potential to help deliver more income overtimewhat type of performance can i expect from the options inside the allianz  annuity if you’re looking for high growth it’s likely you’re going to be recommended the uncapped barclays index uncapped index  that means there is no cap to the amount of interest you can earn wow unlimited upside with zero downside …not so fast you must understand the details the index moves between  bond and  stocks depending on volatility  there’s a spread which subtracts from the return  the current spread has been increasing and is currently  this is subject to change so please check before you buy  this means that if the index returns  you must subtract the spread which would  minus  so you would be credited performancewhile allianz is no longer using back tested ’s and ’s performance  performance with the current spread over the last  years has averaged  annually with the uncapped optionthere are other investment options as well such the barclays dynamic index with cap  currently the cap is   this is subject to change at any time  the barclay’s index has historically been the best performers of all the optionsif you’re looking for high stock market returns you’ll be disappointed with the allianz  annuity  this annuities performance is closer with the performance of bonds than stocks it also has much less downside risk and volatility than stocks so that’s important to consider  where the  get’s more exciting is on the income increases for example if you average  while taking income that means you’ll get  a  increase to your income which is a very good cola this ability to increase is what i like the most about this annuity and is very powerful

this legal disclosure  this review is meant to be an independent review at the request of readers so they could see my perspective as a certified financial planner when breaking down the positives and negatives of this particular model annuity this is an independent product review not a recommendation to buy or sell an annuity riversource  has not endorsed this review in any way nor do i receive any compensation for this review before purchasing any investment product be sure to do your own due diligence and consult a properly licensed professional should you have specific questions as they relate to your individual circumstances this is not meant to be specific advice and your advisor may know more about your circumstances to make an appropriate recommendation all names marks and materials used for this review are property of their respective ownersinformation about riversourceas an owned  subsidiary of ameriprise financial inc riversource according to limra ranks  in annuity sales out all companies nationwide ameriprise is a publicly traded company and trades under ticker amp they have  advisors nationwidethe base annuity has no income rider or guaranteed principal guarantees and  it does not offer any sort of lifetime income   if you are being offered this version of the base annuity with no riders it’s often for tax deferral benefits or the ability to move around between  different sub accounts at no cost it’s important you understand the surrender charge schedule  there are two options for this productriversource annuity rava  advantage surrender charge schedule you can select from the following surrender charge schedules a new surrender charge schedule applies to each purchase payment received according to the schedule you choose the surrender charge is based on purchase payments not your contract value  this means in a down market if you surrender the policy in the first few years the surrender charge could be higher than the amount listed below when compared as a percentage of the value at the time of surrender this is important to understand before purchasing this annuity make sure you have plenty of liquidity to avoid surrendering early       number of completed yearsyear surrender charge scheduleyear surrender charge scheduleriversource annuity rava  advantage fee’s and chargesyear me  through year   years  year me overall this annuity does have low me fees compared to other surrender charge variable annuities it’s nowhere near as low as the low cost variable annuities the investment options available are diverse this allows you to choose from  different investment options from reputable investment funds  the average fee for the sub accounts is  equivalent to the cost of a share mutual funds on averagethe securesource income riderthis rider is added on to the rava advantage to give you lifetime income and  a guaranteed  benefit rollup this fee’s are below and are currently at  on top of the me expense  can bring the total fee’s of the annuity up to over  annuallysecuresource sm – single life rider feemaximum current securesource sm – joint life rider feemaximum current  securesource  plus sm – single life rider feemaximum current  securesource  plussm – joint life rider feemaximum current  understanding the securesource income ridernote that it’s not a  growth that you can walk away with but that you must take lifetime income to receive that  benefit amount with a predetermined withdrawal percentage  this is a big difference than earning  can often take decades to receive a positive internal rate of return  this is not to say the rider can’t be useful but understand this going in the securesource plus allows to get a  rollup to your income benefit for an additional cost stated above with a guaranteed benefit doubling after  years the cost for this rider can change as shown above the current and maximum chargesa critical aspect to understand about this annuity is that with the guarantees you must follow riversource rules investing and invest in  of their stabilizer funds often advisors will make it seem like you can just invest for growth and river source will guarantee you it’s important to make sure you understand what you’re getting into so that it can meet your expectations the guaranteed  rolloup is not real growth but must be taken as income with annuities rules this often can make the real internal rate of return much lower then does this match up to what you’ve been toldit’s extremely important to also compare the opportunity cost of utilizing other assets to satisfy income needs in the years you are deferring if the wrong return assumptions are utilized you or your adviser may be selling the wrong assets first in retirement based on the wrong return assumptions  for example if you truly believe that riversource annuity rava  advantage is earning  or  you may defer this annuity for a very long time and sell assets that are truly earnings   real rate of return  this can be very damaging to your ability to maintain your lifestyle in retirement and you may be forced to downsize does your adviser understand  this concept  you should ask and double check before investingyou are required to invest in one portfolio stabilizer funds managed by columbia if you are choosing one of the ridersthese funds don’t have a track record the moderate allocation has an inception date of april   the rest of the funds have inception dates of april  the moderate fund with the longest track record as of  has a  year average return of  net of all fee’s compared to the class blended benchmark of  annually the portfolio stabilizer growth fund which is the most aggressive and growth oriented fund of the portfolio stabilizer funds has averaged  annually since inception net of all the fees me and single securesource  rider feesspso if your advisor claims that you’ll get market like returns you may need to find a new advisor because they’re not being honest of course we don’t know how the funds will perform over the full market cycle past performance is no guarantee of future results however so far it’s track record in catching market upside has been horribleadditionally…another concern for me about the portfolio stabilizer funds with the riders fee’s is on the more conservative options such as moderate and conservative have bond allocations of anywhere from  with bond yields currently at record lows and with us being unsure of when rates will normalize the fee’s will eat up any interest from the bonds you receive until rates rise substantially that’s something to keep in mind before you purchase this annuity especially if you’re going to select a more conservative option for example the barclays bond index  is yielding  all in fee’s for the annuity with securesource single are around  depending on which surrender schedule with fee’s that are higher then your fixed income it’s difficult to make returns in fact riversource will make more money on your fixed income then you will at current interest rates i hope this matches up to what you’ve been told if not i’m glad i can educate you with the truth  april th  portfolio stabilizer funds updatefor  the portfolio stabilizer funds continued to disappoint  annual performance was  and that’s the most aggressive optionfor up to date performance see portfolio stablizer funds performance click hereunderstanding the protected accumulation benefit riderthe riversource annuity rava  advantage with protected accumulation benefit or pab will likely be pitched as a way to get market growth a principal protection guarantee over a  year period the pab is added at an additional rider cost of  annually as with the securesource rider you must invest in  of the portfolio stabilizer funds so far the performance hasn’t been too stock market like and has been closer to fixed income performancethe caption below is from the riversourcecom website in regards to the accumulation protector benefitprotect it lock it take it®what if you could enjoy both the growth potential of the market and the comfort of knowing your original investment is protected as you accumulate for retirement the accumulation protector benefit apb® an optional rider available with a riversource® variable annuity can protect your principal while you accumulate for up to  years it does this in three important waysprotect it if there are losses to your original investment we’ll pay you back — after a year waiting period you are guaranteed to get back what you put inlock it if your investment grows we’ll help protect your gains — apb automatically locks in  of the highest anniversary value your investment achievestake it you have flexibility to access your money however you would like — after the year waiting period you can choose to take withdrawals create an income stream or get full access to your moneysecure sourcethe part they don’t mention in this pitch is that you have to invest in one of the portfolio stabilizer funds if an advisor tells you that you can have pure stock market like returns with no risk then i think that’s misleading you may want to reconsider your advisor if you skipped over my explanation in the securesource section about the portfolio stabilizer funds please read my explanation under the securesource rider in regards to the stabilizer funds it’s just as important for those who are going to invest in the apb to understand how the portfolio stabilizer funds work and the fee’s associated with it      where it works bestfor producing a pension like lifetime guaranteed income stream with the selected secure source riderif you’re looking for conservative growthwant to have a guarantee on their principal over a  year investment with selected accumulated benefit riderfor those who want the ability to move around to different managers at no cost with tax deferralbase annuity with no ridersto guarantee an income stream in the future  securesource riderwhere it works worstindividuals looking for maximum capital appreciationthose who need liquiditywho want to invest in other funds beside the managed volatility if you’re choosing one of the guaranteed riders such as guaranteed accumulation or secure sourcefor those looking to keep more of what they earn by keeping fee’s low for maximum long term growthoverall i think riversource annuity rava  advantage has some good features and some bad ones the base annuity without the riders is relatively low cost compared to other annuities in it’s class what concerns me is the low performance portfolio stabilizer funds that are required if you choose one of the riders buying an annuity is a long term commitment you should test riversource annuity rava  advantage versus various other annuities to see which fits your goals and objectives the mostin conclusionanother aspect is testing the rate of return of the income rider typically these annuities earn nowhere near  of the guaranteed income rider amountif your financial plan says you need  annually in retirement don’t think you can buy perspective ii and earn  guaranteed your investing and retirement planning isn’t done you’ll need a comprehensive retirement income analysis that factors inflation taxes and your investment positioning to see if the annuity adds value to your retirement get a retirement income analysis done before buyingthe income rider is not as valuable as it seems test it and see if it’s worth it for you we do for free at annuityeducom the only way

your agent was honest with you the numbers will match up – if not well at least you know before you buyannuity edu’s summary on the riversource annuity rava  advantageunfortunately i think advisers may be underestimating the impact that the fee’s of the portfolio over time especially if choosing one of the riders that’s why we can help you test the guarantee in your financial plan and for the internal rate of return it provides this isn’t to say that having the riders may not be a good way to meet your financial objectives with a portion of your dollars it might but it’s only possible
