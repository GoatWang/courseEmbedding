of multiple neural symptoms including head pain nausea vomiting and sensitivity to light migraines may also continue for multiple days at a time more than  million americans are affected by migraine which is more than  of the total population that results in an average of  billion annuallymigraines come in two different primary forms migraines with aura and those without aura migraine aura is when the headache pain is accompanied by other sensory discomfort such as sensitivity to light sound touch and smell one may experience an “auraonly” migraine a migraine with debilitating head pain or both as one of the twentymost debilitating medical illness in the united states migraine has a large affect on the economy as well costing employers more than  billion per year due to lost work days there is not a generic list of symptoms that comes with migraines as many are specific to the individual these range from extreme pain nausea sensitivity to light  sound and many more along the same lines there are numerous triggers that cause migraines including environmental factors lifestyle and food however migraine triggers are unique to the individual and are not the cause of the migraine rather migraine triggers are the precursor to the constricting of blood vessels and other physiological changes that cause migraine types of migraines  classic migrainea classic migraine
