an interview with bishop barron by brandon vogtseptember   comments tomorrow bishop robert barron will deliver the opening keynote talk for the world meeting of families i recently sat down with him to discuss his talk pope francis and challenges facing the family today brandon vogt what do you appreciate about pope francis teaching on the family what do you think he gets right bishop robert barron ive been very impressed by his reiteration of humanae vitae which is very important some people are wavering a bit wondering does humanae vitae have a future is it right or wrong this pope clearly reaffirmed the great intuitions of humanae vitae which ive always seen as the churchs call to radical holiness the church is not in the business of spiritual mediocrity or settling for second best its in the business of making saints we call people to a radical holiness and thats what humanae vitae is all about how to live your married life in a radically holy way the pope is right in reemphasizing the importance of humanae vitae brandon what issues do you hope pope francis highlights at the world meeting of families bishop robert barron my greatest hope is that he encourages families we can get bogged down sometimes in the hotbutton issues the back and forth on particular matters and thats fine we should do some of that but i would hope he really encourages families who often feel beleaguered who dont have a clear sense of direction id like pope francis to come as a good papa a good father and encourage families to be what theyre supposed to be which is an ecclesiola a little church st john paul ii had the right language here the family is a domestic church where missions are cultivated where people learn the virtues and how to love which is what the trinity is all about i hope the pope will encourage families and give them a sense of the spiritual mission that is inherent in being a family brandon before being names auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of los angeles you were the rector of mundelein seminary where you were responsible for training hundreds of young men most of those futurepriests will directly minister to families what needs will they respond to bishop robert barron the two most important needs are for purpose and encouragement families today need a keen religious and spiritual sensibility about the family the family is not just a political economic or psychological reality its a spiritual reality it mirrors the trinity gods covenant is expressed through families god has created a kind of family in the church the mystical body i also emphasized to my seminarians that the spiritual fathers job is to help families understand the spiritual dimension and purpose of family life once you get that clear everything else readily falls into place recovering the spiritual heart of the family—thats the need that has to be addressed brandon what do you think the media get wrong in covering questions about the family bishop robert barron the media are always waiting for the church to change its mind they suggest questions like do we have the votes or survey results to overturn church teaching is the new pope going to change things around but thats precisely the wrong way to think about it the church is always interested in responding better to pastoral needs so it does adjust to changing cultural situations but its not like were just caught in mutability the church is not like a political party or political institution that changes its policies every eight or ten years the media get that wrong and therefore always try to read the church in a sort of adversarial confrontational way with winners losers and a constant tugofwar they see the church politically rather than as a sacred institution and thats the problem brandon the most recent synod focused on the family and the one preceding it was on the new evangelization do you think this was intentional is there a connection here bishop robert barron absolutely whats the vehicle for evangelization the real bearer of evangelization is the family families are called like christ to be priests prophets and kings they are priests when they sacrifice and usher each other to god they are prophets when they teach what christianity is about and put it on display they are kings when they guide their families and relationships into right order all of these expressions are deeply evangelistic so i think theres a huge connection between families and the new evangelization brandon tell us a little bit about your opening keynote talk at the world meeting of families titled living as the image of god created for joy and love bishop robert barron the talk will center around the imago dei the fact that were made in the image of god and thus made for joy instead of focusing on the hotbutton issues concerning the family the organizers asked me to explore the broader sense of the image of god and how families reflect it i plan to use the rubric i hinted at earlier that of priest prophet and king to be made in the image of god means that we participate in these three missions to sanctify to teach and to govern thats true throughout salvation history its true of us as individuals and its especially true of families families are the bearer of these three tasks now and down through the ages so the talk begins with a biblical background to the imago dei—what it is how it was lost and how it is restored through the church then i show how the family especially bears that power into the world brandon youve affirmed the need for families to be encouraged suppose in philadelphia pope francis hands you the microphone and says ill give you one sentence to encourage families around the world what do you say bishop robert barron your family is a means by which god wants to sanctify the world photo credit dave crenshaw  eastern oklahoma catholic this interview originally appeared in catholic digest used with permission about the author

reading season saint language category most popular featured date latest store donate menu articles print back to articles the pope the congress and a trappist monk by bishop robert barronseptember   comments i had the extraordinary privilege last week of following the pope’s pilgrimage at very close quarters i had this access both as a bishop and as a commentator for nbc news it was thrilling indeed to witness just how rapturously the american people received the pope and how affected the holy father was by this reception many images stay vividly in my mind the pope kissing the forehead of the ten year old boy with cerebral palsy the rabbi and imam praying together at the september th memorial a little boy from a new york catholic school showing the pope how to maneuver his way around a smart board but what stays most powerfully with me is the pope speaking to a joint meeting of the united states congress in washington dc  my first assignment for nbc last week was the today show’s coverage of the pope’s arrival on the south lawn of the white house as i sat on the platform with matt lauer and maria shriver i looked across at the stately obelisk of the washington monument and i remembered an extraordinary event from the mid nineteenth century along with many other world leaders pope pius ix had sent a block for the construction of the monument to the father of our country but an angry mob of anticatholic bigots took that piece of marble and threw it into the potomac this of course was not an isolated or purely egregious act of vandalism rather it partook of a widespread and deeplyrooted hatred of catholicism that lasted in this country in fairly virulent form up to the election of john f kennedy in  that the pope of rome would be graciously received at the white house and welcomed to speak before the entire congress of the united states would have struck most americans for much of our history as simply unthinkable and this is why and i’ll confess it openly my eyes filled with tears as i saw the pope standing at the rostrum in the house of representatives the cheers of the gathered lawmakers washing over him  and as i listened to the pope’s words that day i was even more astonished as is his wont francis didn’t trade in abstractions instead he focused his remarks on four outstanding figures from american history—abraham lincoln martin luther king jr dorothy day and thomas merton—each of whom spoke of some dimension of authentic freedom anyone familiar with my work over the years would know that all four of these people are heroes of mine i have a photo of lincoln over the desk in my office i have written extensively on king and have done a number of videos on his life and legacy dorothy day is featured prominently in my documentary catholicism see episode  and thomas merton is quite simply one of the major reasons that i entered the priesthood and a photo of him is in eyeshot as i type these words  i would love to explore the pope’s analysis of each of these giants but given the limited scope of this article i will focus on the one i consider the most important namely merton what merton signaled for the pope was the openness to dialogue with other religions to be sure but also and more significantly the contemplative openness to the reality of god to a dimension that goes beyond the empirical world and the achievements of the individual ego this is of supreme importance for when a sense of god evanesces—as it has increasingly in our secularized western world—all we have left for understanding human affairs are psychological and political categories armed only with these we fall into the customary patterns of left and right liberal and conservative open to change and suspicious of change etc and this furthermore makes catholic social teaching so confounding to the pundits and politicos how can the catholic church simultaneously advocate against abortion and assisted suicide but for immigration reform and attention to the poor how can it stand against the abuse of the environment and for the free market against the death penalty and for the family with god out of the picture it is indeed hard to make sense of such an array of opinions but with god at the heart of things the various positions of the church fall into harmony much like the medallions in a rose window if god exists then every individual person that he has created is a subject of rights freedom and dignity if god exists then no one is expendable and everyone is equally worthy of respect it is none other than the contemplative attitude exemplified by thomas merton that reveals this deep consistency   how wonderful and strange that a pope would be addressing congress at all but how surpassing wonderful and strange it was that he should use the occasion to hold up before the lawmakers of the most powerful nation on earth the example of a trappist monk who gave his life to the contemplation of god

that it is not republican or democrat that we should side with but rather christs viewpoints on humanity having visits gethsemane and mertons library at bellarmine u his writings are among the most influential in my short life thank you again for your leadership and courage october   bill galvan whew  october   bill galvan hi bishop baron and welcome to la my two mites “how can the church stand against the abuse of the environment and for the free market” by pointing out as often as necessary how free market economies have overall better environmental records than centrally planned economies like china and the ussr when environmental protection becomes valuable to the people businesses will sell it to them “…against the death penalty and for the family” interesting juxtaposition it’s probably why my prolife profamily position compels me to also be prodeath penalty october   bill galvan and paragraphs are not allowedok october   bill galvan ok pressing will post the response with no delete or edit capabilitiescompose all response in word…got it october   bill galvan how can it stand against the abuse of the environment and for the free market  october   nicholas chaplin i remember fr barron saying once that thomas merton was probably not a saint at least i think they were the words but with all respect i wonder now thinking of the immensity of his influence the strength of his teachings and yes his utter commitment regardless of his faults we are all sinners even the saints i now wonder whether he may indeed be a saint its not a bad thing for the pope to be mentioning you in your centennial year in such a memorable way and in such an important speech god bless you bishop barron for introducing me to thomas merton and your own evangelical ways september   ed griffin i thought of you immediately when the pope mentioned thomas merton i took you seriously on your choice of the five  most important books for you in forming your viewpoint about catholicism mertons seven story mountain was one of them i read this books journey to faith from mertons childhood to that of becoming the trappist monk the trappist who started as anything but a serious christian to one who devoutly believed my wife and i went to dc and ny to see the pope and i felt so at home in being one of the thousands to admire the pope for his journey through the streets of the us i guess i now feel how important mertons books and his life are one of those pillars of faith to help us on our journey of faith i also believe  maybe predict that one day you will move through the streets of the us as the first catholic american pope you have already established yourself as a voice of the church to millions using social media you are on your own st paul like journey and many will take shots at you as appear on youtube but you make brilliantly clear the many reason to better understand faith hope and love and all the roads that lead there god bless us all authors bishop
