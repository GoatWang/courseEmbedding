shirley brian color changing cotton yarn – page  rated  out of  jennifer kimball – february   picked up this yarn when i went into rosehaven for needles started the mariner pattern and am loving the gradual colour change and the ever increasing number of stitches working on my first “knot” row now and finding it fairly simple but effective converted the pattern into an excel spreadsheet for ease of making there are quite a few repeats of rows one and two and i find it easier to tick off the rows rather than write it down pics soon on ravelry rated  out of  evelyne sawyer – may   really enjoyed doing this mariner pattern quite simple and especially the blocking made the finished piece so attractive would do it again add a review cancel reply your email address will not be published
