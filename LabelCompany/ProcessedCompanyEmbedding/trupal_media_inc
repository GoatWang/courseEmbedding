position over new arrivals although there are many casino apps and many new app entries the top ten still manage to hold onto  of the market for a new entry to make any significant inroads a

publisher incorporated in the state of florida on march   we operate in the gaming content delivery business the company launched its flagship social gaming app “cleo’s casino” on april   cleo’s

have recorded cumulative gross revenues of  and expended  in marketing and advertising costs to encourage user downloads and purchases of virtual currency approximately  users have made at least  or more in app purchases to date  the company’s ability to become profitable is dependent on our ability to market to a wider audience and thereby generate continuous in app purchases from a broad user base accelerating the purchase of virtual currency for use in our games   our founder president and ceo mr panayis palexas has to date invested over  million both personally and through his controlled entities towards the development and launch of the company’s facebook application framework and platform which delivers our casino style game content including slots and slot tournaments to usersplayers on facebook we intend to rely heavily on capital provided from mr palexas to meet operational shortfalls as we expand our business and seek outside financing sources to complete the implementation of our business plan   in addition prior to and following this offering mr palexas controls over  of the voting power for our common stock by virtue of his ownership of  shares of series a preferred stock our series a preferred stock has  votes per share and our common stock which is the stock we are offering in this offering has one vote per share as a result mr palexas will continue to have significant influence over the management and affairs of the company and control over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future      trupal has not yet hired any permanent staff and as stated above presently relies heavily on our sole officer and director mr panayis palexas to fund and manage our day to day business  we currently outsource all professional services from third parties to maintain lower operational costs presently key services such as marketing and customer support and game content are contracted with companies controlled by our sole officer and director  trupal relies exclusively on game media works ltd controlled by mr palexas to provide new gaming content and integration of that content as well as ongoing maintenance that might be required for the app in addition we rely on panash sac also controlled by mr panayis to deliver marketing and support services to the company  these services include graphics for game ads facebook posting player support and other services   cleo’s casino has had good response from players as demonstrated through our consistent user growth and increasing retention rate trupal is focused on delivering high quality gaming apps maintaining low costs and driving a rigorous marketing campaign that will ensure steady growth and value for the company and its shareholders in order to maintain userplayer interest ensure repeat visits and increase our user base we will look to raise funds to invest in marketing and increase unique user downloads  through additional capital for expanded marketing activities we can also encourage revisits and expanded play from our existing userplayer base most importantly we intend targeting marketing efforts to increase our in app purchasing userplayer database and thereby increases to our new user downloads   although the company has no market for its common stock management believes that the company will meet all requirements to be quoted on the otc market and even though the company’s common stock will  be a penny stock becoming a reporting company will provide us with enhanced visibility and give us a greater possibility to provide liquidity to our shareholders we will seek out such financing as necessary to allow the company to continue to grow our business operations we do not currently have sufficient revenues or cash on hand to meet our operational overhead or planned operations  we estimate that our cash requirements for our fiscal year ending march   will be between  and  based on the success we have in raising additional capital and the marketing efforts we undertake at a minimum we will expend  in the next twelve months to maintain our public reporting requirements pay third party contractors and implement our most modest use of proceeds for user expansion marketing and corporate growth at an advertising rate of  per day  we expect to be able to allocate gross profits from sales of approximately  to this overhead leaving a shortfall of  which amount is expected to be provided by our sole officer and director mr panayis palexas and his related entities we have developed use of proceeds for our gaming expansion plans for various investment amounts ranging from the minimum of  up to  in available capital  the speed with which we grow and achieve profitability is directly related to our initial and ongoing marketing expenditures in order to build our daily purchasing user base  dependent on our success in raising additional capital above the minimum capital requirements we will implement a marketing program which fits our available funds   our president and director mr panayis palexas has agreed to accrue amounts payable for services provided by his controlled entities and to fund the company’s shortfalls in operational and advertising overhead until such time as additional capital can be secured to expand operations and at a minimum for the operations of the company to the close of fiscal   the company expects the cash shortfall during this period to be approximately  depending on the marketing budget that will be implemented under direction of mr palexas  the majority of the anticipated shortfalls approx  represents amounts payable to service providers controlled by mr palexas under licensing and marketing contracts which amounts will be accrued until such time as the company reaches profitable operations or is successful in raising additional capital   our prior operating history current purchasing user rates and new user retention projections indicate that with a minimal advertising spend of  per day approx year we should be able to generate revenues sufficient to meet our basic operating overhead save amounts as set out above we have no formal agreements in place with mr palexas evidencing these commitments we will seek to raise up to  in order to fully implement our business plan including our planned future operations which includes substantive funding for marketing and development of new product for our online apps  we will also bear other costs excluding professional fees associated with being a reporting company with the securities and exchange commission sec we estimate these costs to be approximately  for  months following this offering the company has included such costs to become a publicly reporting company in its targeted expenses for working capital expenses and intends to seek out reasonable loans from friends family and business acquaintances outside of amounts advanced by mr palexas if it becomes necessary neither the company nor our ceo mr panayis palexas or any other affiliated or unaffiliated entity has any plans to use the company as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company once trupal media inc becomes a reporting company additionally we do not believe the company is a blank check company as defined in section a of rule  under the securities act of  as amended because the company has a specific business plan and has no plans or intentions to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified entity          summary financial information the following tables summarize our financial data

degree of risk you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth under the “risk factors” section herein and the other information contained in this prospectus before making an investment decision regarding our common stock            risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed currently shares of our common stock are not publicly traded in the event that shares of our common stock become publicly traded the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in the event our common stock fails to become publicly traded you may lose all or part of your investment   risks related to our business and industry if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with facebook our business will suffer   facebook is the primary distribution marketing promotion and payment platform for our games we generate substantially all of our revenue and players through the facebook platform and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future any deterioration in our relationship with facebook would harm our business and adversely affect the value of our common stock   we are subject to facebook’s standard terms and conditions for application developers which govern the promotion distribution and operation of games and other applications on the facebook platform   our business would be harmed if · facebook discontinues or limits access to its platform by us and other game developers · facebook modifies its terms of service or other policies including fees charged to or other restrictions on us or other application developers or facebook changes how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the facebook platform or shared by users · facebook establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors or · facebook develops its own competitive offerings   we have benefited from facebook’s strong brand recognition and large user base if facebook loses its market position or otherwise falls out of favor with internet users we would need to identify alternative channels for marketing promoting and distributing our games which would consume substantial resources and may not be effective in addition facebook has broad discretion to change its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers and those changes may be unfavorable to us for example in  facebook adopted a policy requiring applications on facebook accept only its virtual currency facebook credits as payment from users as a result of this change which we completed in april  facebook receives a greater share of payments made by our players than it did when other payment options were allowed facebook may also change its fee structure add fees associated with access to and use of the facebook platform change how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the facebook platform or restrict how facebook users can share information with friends on their platform beginning in early  facebook changed its policies for application developers regarding use of its communication channels these changes limited the level of communication among users about applications on the facebook platform      we operate in a new and rapidly changing industry which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects   social gaming from which we derive substantially all of our revenue is a new and rapidly evolving industry the growth of the social game industry and the level of demand and market acceptance of our games are subject to a high degree of uncertainty our future operating results will depend on numerous factors affecting the social game industry many of which are beyond our control including · continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of facebook and other social networks · changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences · the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment · the worldwide growth of personal computer broadband internet and mobile device users and the rate of any such growth and · general economic conditions particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending   our ability to plan for game development distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by our ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in the tastes and preferences of our current and potential players new and different types of entertainment may increase in popularity at the expense of social games a decline in the popularity of social games in general or our games in particular would harm our business and prospects   we have a new business model and a short operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results and may increase the risk that we will not be successful   we began operations in march  and we have a short operating history and a new business model which makes it difficult to effectively assess our future prospects our business model is based on offering games that are free to play to date only a small portion of our players pay for virtual goods you should consider our business and prospects in light of the challenges we face including the ones discussed in these “risk factors” no formal agreement exists between the company and our president for the acquisition of our flagship game on march   peter palexis transferred the rights of use of “cleo’s casino” to the company  no consideration was paid by the company and no terms were set forth related to the transfer  this means that our flagship product cleo’s casino is potentially at risk of being removed at the whim of mr palexis  the company has no defined rights or remedies to ensure the company is protected in such an event  the uncertainty of the right and obligations may also concern future potential investors and hamper our ability to raise additional capital to continue to grow our company           a small number of games have generated a majority of our revenue and we must continue to launch and enhance games that attract and retain a significant number of players in order to grow our revenue and sustain our competitive position   historically we have depended on a small number of games for a majority of our revenue and we expect that this dependency will continue for the foreseeable future our growth depends on our ability to consistently launch new games that achieve significant popularity each of our games requires significant engineering marketing and other resources to develop launch and sustain via regular upgrades and expansions and such costs on average have increased our ability to successfully launch sustain and expand games and attract and retain players largely will depend on our ability to · anticipate and effectively respond to changing game player interests and preferences · anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape · attract retain and motivate talented game designers product managers and engineers · develop sustain and expand games that are fun interesting and compelling to play · effectively market new games and enhancements to our existing players and new players · minimize launch delays and cost overruns on new games and game expansions · minimize downtime and other technical difficulties and · acquire high quality assets personnel and companies   it is difficult to consistently anticipate player demand on a large scale particularly as we develop games in new genres or new markets including international markets and mobile platforms if we do not successfully launch games that attract and retain a significant number of players and extend the life of our existing games our market share reputation and financial results will be harmed   if our top games do not maintain their popularity our results of operations could be harmed   in addition to creating new games that are attractive to a significant number of players we must extend the life of our existing games in particular our most successful games for a game to remain popular we must constantly enhance expand or upgrade the game with new features that players find attractive such constant enhancement requires the investment of significant resources particularly with older games and such costs on average have increased we may not be able to successfully enhance expand or upgrade our current games any reduction in the number of players of our most popular games any decrease in the popularity of our games or social games in general any breach of gamerelated security or prolonged server interruption any loss of rights to any intellectual property underlying such games or any other adverse developments relating to our most popular games could harm our results of operations    any failure or significant interruption in our network could impact our operations and harm our business   our technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our games and to player satisfaction our games run on a complex distributed system or what is commonly known as cloud computing we own operate and maintain the primary elements of this system but some elements of this system are operated by third parties that we do not control and which may require significant time to replace   the providers of cloudbased services required by the company are large international corporations such as amazon apple cisco citrix ibm joyent google microsoft rackspace salesforcecom and verizonterremark all of which provide for   “uptime” as part of their standard service level agreement we expect this dependence on third parties to continue and while it would be inconvenient to change service providers as a result of unreliable service there are numerous providers available to the company providing the required services we have experienced and may in the future experience website disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors and capacity constraints if a particular game is unavailable when players attempt to access it or navigation through a game is slower than they expect players may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the game as often if at all a failure or significant interruption in our game service would harm our reputation and operations we expect to continue to make significant investments in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve all aspects of player experience and game performance to the extent that our disaster recovery systems are not adequate or we do not effectively address capacity constraints upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate increasing traffic our business and operating results may suffer we do not maintain insurance policies covering losses relating to our systems and we do not have business interruption insurance   security breaches computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations   security breaches computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data software hardware or other computer equipment and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business financial condition and operating results we have experienced and will continue to experience hacking attacks because of our prominence in the social game industry we believe we are a particularly attractive target for hackers though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach any failure to maintain performance reliability security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players            if we fail to effectively manage our growth our business and operating results could be harmed   we continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations which will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational financial and technological infrastructure which presently consists of our sole officer and director as well as third party service providers controlled by our sole officer and director in order to continue to grow and meet our stated objections we will have to expend significant resources to identify hire integrate develop and motivate a number of qualified employees if we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully integrate our new hires when resources are available our ability to continue launching new games and enhance existing games could suffer   to effectively manage the growth of our business and operations we will need to continue spending significant resources to improve our technology infrastructure our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures by among other things · monitoring and updating our technology infrastructure to maintain high performance and minimize down time · enhancing information and communication systems to ensure that employees and offices around the world are wellcoordinated and can effectively communicate with each other · enhancing our internal controls to ensure timely and accurate reporting of all of our operations and · appropriately documenting our information technology systems and our business processes    these enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources if we fail to implement these enhancements and improvements effectively our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies will be impaired in addition if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our operating results will suffer   our growth prospects will suffer if we are unable to continue to develop successful games for mobile platforms   developing games for mobile platforms is an important component of our strategy we have devoted and we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of our mobile games and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to develop such games that appeal to players or advertisers the uncertainties we face include · we have relatively limited experience working with wireless carriers mobile platform providers and other partners whose cooperation we may need in order to be successful · we may encounter difficulty in integrating features on games developed for mobile platforms that a sufficient number of players will pay for and · we will need to move beyond payment methods provided by social networks and successfully allow for a variety of payment methods and systems based on the mobile platform geographies and other factors   these and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will succeed in continuing to develop commercially viable games for mobile if we do not succeed in doing so our growth prospects will suffer  if we lose the services of our founder and chief executive officer we may not be able to execute our business strategy   our success depends in a large part upon the continued service of our senior management team in particular our founder and chief executive officer panayis “peter” palexas is critical to our vision strategic direction culture products and technology we do not maintain keyman insurance for mr palexas the loss of our founder and chief executive officer even temporarily would harm our business we do not presently have sufficient capital to meet our operational overhead we rely heavily on funding from our sole officer and director to continue operations and will need to raise additional capital to fully implement our business plan we do not presently have sufficient cash on hand or revenue generating operations to meet our ongoing overhead and rely on our sole officer and director mr panayis palexas to fund our shortfall in operations while mr palexas has agreed to meet our operational shortfalls and accrue fees for services provided by third parties controlled by him at a minimum up to the close of our fiscal year ended march   there is no guarantee mr palexas will have the available capital to meet his commitment  we have no formal agreements in place with mr palexas evidencing these commitments in addition in order to fully implement our business plan and achieve profitability we need to raise additional capital in order to expand our marketing efforts and secure additional inapp purchases from our existing users and additional users  there can be no guarantee we will be successful in raising additional capital as required and our failure to do so will drastically affect our ability to grow the business or even continue operations          our sole officer and director mr panayis palexas also controls our key third party service providers which may result in a conflict of interest panayis palexis our sole officer and director is also the owner and control persons of entities with which the company directly conducts business  specifically he owns and operates game media works ltd which provides nonexclusive nontransferable right for the games operated by the company and panash sac which provides marketing supporting including creating adds for the company and managing the social network profiles of the company  the games provided by game media works ltd are developed specifically for the company’s business however as the licenses are not exclusive game media works ltd could license the games to other parties  in addition game media works ltd under the direction of panayis palexis could divert resources where the company is not provided sufficient support to the games or provide new games for the trupal brand  in the event that game works media ltd ceased providing support and development for the company our growth model would be severely compromised  in tandem with reduced efforts under the service agreement with panache sac the company would not be able to gain more users as our business plan requires  in addition opportunities may arise from third parties that could benefit the company that could be diverted to game media works ltd  in such cases mr palexis will evaluate such opportunities in respect to the company first and will only pass along to game media works ltd where there is no real benefit to the company  we are confident that mr palexis as the majority holder will manage his interests to the benefit of the company if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees we may not be able to grow effectively   our ability to compete and grow will depend in large part on the efforts and talents of  new employees such employees particularly game designers product managers and engineers are in high demand and we devote significant resources to identifying hiring training successfully integrating and retaining these employees a lack of capital to hire employees the  loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees as necessary could result in significant disruptions to our business and the integration of replacement personnel could be timeconsuming and expensive and cause additional disruptions to our business   expansion into international markets is important for our growth and as we expand internationally we will face additional business political regulatory operational financial and economic risks any of which could increase our costs and hinder such growth   continuing to expand our business to attract players in countries other than the united states is a critical element of our business strategy an important part of targeting international markets is developing offerings that are localized and customized for the players in those markets we have a limited operating history as a company outside of the united states we expect to continue to devote significant resources to international expansion through acquisitions the establishment of additional offices and development studios and increasing our foreign language offerings our ability to expand our business and to attract talented employees as required and players in an increasing number of international markets will require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages cultures customs legal systems alternative dispute systems regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures expanding our international focus may subject us to risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face including risks associated with        · recruiting and retaining talented and capable management and employees in foreign countries · challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences · developing and customizing games and other offerings that appeal to the tastes and preferences of players in international markets · competition from local game makers with significant market share in those markets and with a better understanding of player preferences · protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights · negotiating agreements with local distribution platforms that are sufficiently economically beneficial to us and protective of our rights · the inability to extend proprietary rights in our brand content or technology into new jurisdictions · implementing alternative payment methods for virtual goods in a manner that complies with local laws and practices and protects us from fraud · compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations including privacy laws and laws relating to content · compliance with antibribery laws including without limitation compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act · credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud · currency exchange rate fluctuations · protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries · foreign tax consequences · foreign exchange controls or us tax restrictions that might restrict or prevent us from repatriating income earned in countries outside the united states · political economic and social instability · higher costs associated with doing business internationally · export or import regulations and · trade and tariff restrictions entering new international markets will be expensive our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any particular market is uncertain and the distraction of our senior management team could harm our business          competition within the broader entertainment industry is intense and our existing and potential players may be attracted to competing forms of entertainment such as offline and traditional online games television movies and sports as well as other entertainment options on the internet   our players face a vast array of entertainment choices other forms of entertainment such as offline traditional online personal computer and console games television movies sports online gambling and the internet are much larger and more wellestablished markets and may be perceived by our players to offer greater variety affordability interactivity and enjoyment these other forms of entertainment compete for the discretionary time and income of our players if we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in our games in comparison to other forms of entertainment including new forms of entertainment our business model may no longer be viable   there are low barriers to entry in the social game industry and competition is intense   the social game industry is highly competitive with low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider range of social games to be introduced our competitors that develop social games for social networks vary in size and include publiclytraded companies such as electronic arts inc and the walt disney company and privatelyheld companies such as crowdstar inc vostu ltd dena co ltd kingcom and wooga gmbh in addition online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets such as tencent holdings limited in asia and highprofile companies with significant online presences that to date have not developed social games such as amazoncom facebook google inc and microsoft corporation may decide to develop social games some of these current and potential competitors have significant resources for developing or acquiring additional games may be able to incorporate their own strong brands and assets into their games have a more diversified set of revenue sources than we do and may be less severely affected by changes in consumer preferences regulations or other developments that may impact the online social game industry in addition we have limited experience in developing games for mobile and other platforms and our ability to succeed on those platforms is uncertain as we continue to devote significant resources to developing games for those platforms we will face significant competition from established companies including electronic arts gree dena gameloft sa glu mobile inc disney and rovio mobile ltd we expect new mobilegame competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications   the value of our virtual goods is highly dependent on how we manage the economies in our games if we fail to manage our game economies properly our business may suffer   paying players purchase virtual goods in our games because of the perceived value of these goods which is dependent on the relative ease of securing an equivalent good via nonpaid means within the game the perceived value of these virtual goods can be impacted by an increase in the availability of free or discounted facebook credits or by various actions that we take in the games including offering discounts for virtual goods giving away virtual goods in promotions or providing easier nonpaid means to secure these goods if we fail to manage our virtual economies properly players may be less likely to purchase virtual goods and our business may suffer   some of our players may make sales andor purchases of virtual goods used in our games through unauthorized thirdparty websites which may impede our revenue growth   some of our players may make sales andor purchases of our virtual goods through unauthorized thirdparty sellers in exchange for real currency these unauthorized transactions are usually arranged on thirdparty websites we do not generate any revenue from these transactions accordingly these unauthorized purchases and sales from thirdparty sellers could impede our revenue and profit growth by among other things · decreasing revenue from authorized transactions · downward pressure on the prices we charge players for our virtual currency and virtual goods · lost revenue from paying players who stop playing a particular game · costs we incur to develop technological measures to curtail unauthorized transactions · legal claims relating to the diminution of value of our virtual goods and · increased customer support costs to respond to dissatisfied players the proliferation of “cheating” programs and scam offers that seek to exploit our games and players affects the gameplaying experience and may lead players to stop playing our games   unrelated third parties have developed and may continue to develop “cheating” programs that enable players to exploit our games play them in an automated way or obtain unfair advantages over other players who do play fairly these programs harm the experience of players who play fairly and may disrupt the virtual economy of our games in addition unrelated third parties attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods we devote significant resources to discover and disable these programs and activities and if we are unable to do so quickly our operations may be disrupted our reputation damaged and players may stop playing our games this may lead to lost revenue from paying players increased cost of developing technological measures to combat these programs and activities legal claims relating to the diminution in value of our virtual currency and goods and increased customer service costs needed to respond to dissatisfied players            our quarterly operating results are volatile and difficult to predict and our stock price may decline if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors   our bookings revenue traffic and operating results could vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear and may fail to match our past performance or the expectations of securities analysis or investors because of a variety of factors some of which are outside of our control any of these events could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results include the risk factors listed in these “risk factors” and the factors discussed in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”    given our short operating history and the rapidly evolving social game industry our historical operating results may not be useful in predicting our future operating results in addition metrics we have developed or those available from third parties regarding our industry and the performance of our games including daily active users “daus” monthly active users “maus” monthly unique users “muus” and  average billing per user “abpu” may not be indicative of our financial performance   failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could harm our business and operating results   we regard the protection of our trade secrets copyrights trademarks trade dress domain names and other product rights as critical to our success we strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights as well as contractual restrictions we intend to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees upon hire and with our contractors  we will also enter into confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure and use of our proprietary information however these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others   we pursue the registration of our domain names trademarks and service marks in the united states and in certain locations outside the united states we are seeking to protect our trademarks patents and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions a process that is expensive and timeconsuming and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location we may over time increase our investment in protecting our innovations through increased patent filings that are expensive and timeconsuming and may not result in issued patents that can be effectively enforced   litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs adverse publicity or diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results if we fail to maintain protect and enhance our intellectual property rights our business and operating results may be harmed    programming errors or flaws in our games could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our games which would harm our operating results   our games may contain errors bugs flaws or corrupted data and these defects may only become apparent after their launch particularly as we launch new games and rapidly release new features to existing games under tight time constraints we believe that if our players have a negative experience with our games they may be less inclined to continue or resume playing our games or recommend our games to other potential players undetected programming errors game defects and data corruption can disrupt our operations adversely affect the game experience of our players by allowing players to gain unfair advantage harm our reputation cause our players to stop playing our games divert our resources and delay market acceptance of our games any of which could result in legal liability to us or harm our operating results   evolving regulations concerning data privacy may result in increased regulation and different industry standards which could prevent us from providing our current games to our players or require us to modify our games thereby harming our business   the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet and mobile platforms have recently come under increased public scrutiny and civil claims alleging liability for the breach of data privacy have been asserted against us the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices in addition the european union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies with users in europe various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices    we process store and use personal information and other data which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business   we receive store and process personal information and other player data and we enable our players to share their personal information with each other and with third parties including on the internet and mobile platforms there are numerous federal state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information and other player data on the internet and mobile platforms the scope of which are changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our own privacy policies and privacyrelated obligations to third parties including voluntary thirdparty certification bodies such as truste we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and certain industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection to the extent reasonably attainable however it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies our privacyrelated obligations to players or other third parties or our privacyrelated legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our players to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our business additionally if third parties we work with such as players vendors or developers violate applicable laws or our policies such violations may also put our players’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business   in the area of information security and data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to players when there is a security breach for personal data such as the  amendment to california’s information practices act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities          our business is subject to a variety of other us and foreign laws many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business   we are subject to a variety of laws in the united states and abroad including laws regarding consumer protection intellectual property export and national security that are continuously evolving and developing the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly laws outside the united states for example laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts unfair competition copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched the ads posted or the content provided by users it is also likely that as our business grows and evolves and our games are played in a greater number of countries we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions we are potentially subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types of content such as that which depicts violence many of which are ambiguous still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or expose us to liability in addition certain of our games may become subject to gamblingrelated rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties if we do not comply it is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to our business and the new laws to which we may become subject see the discussion included in the section titled “business—government regulation”   if we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability this may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our games which would harm our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results   it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the united states and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile industries including player privacy advertising taxation content suitability copyright distribution and antitrust furthermore the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the internet and mobile devices we anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods if that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of social game services and impair our business   companies and governmental agencies may restrict access to facebook our website or the internet generally which could lead to the loss or slower growth of our player base   our players need to access the internet and in particular facebook and our website to play our games companies and governmental agencies could block access to facebook our website or the internet generally for a number of reasons such as security or confidentiality concerns or regulatory reasons or they may adopt policies that prohibit employees from accessing facebook our website or other social platforms for example the government of the people’s republic of china has blocked access to facebook in china if companies or governmental entities block or limit access to facebook or our website or otherwise adopt policies restricting players from playing our games our business could be negatively impacted and could lead to the loss or slower growth of our player base   failure in pursuing or executing new business initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our business and future growth   our growth strategy includes evaluating considering and effectively executing new business initiatives which can be difficult management may not properly ascertain or assess the risks of new initiatives and subsequent events may alter the risks that were evaluated at the time we decided to execute any new initiative entering into any new initiatives can also divert our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities failure to effectively identify pursue and execute new business initiatives may adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will affect our financial results which we report in us dollars   as we continue to expand our international operations we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates we incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our nonus locations in the local currency and an increasing percentage of our international revenue is from players who pay us in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of such expenses being higher andor the dollar equivalent of such foreigndenominated revenue being lower than would be the case if exchange rates were stable this could have a negative impact on our reported operating results   the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the us taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations   the current administration has made public statements indicating that it has made international tax reform a priority and key members of the us congress have conducted hearings and proposed new legislation recent changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the united states are repatriated to the united states as well as changes to us tax laws that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities any changes in the us taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations          a change in the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions could result in an increase to our worldwide effective tax rate and a change in how we operate our business   our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions are intended to provide us worldwide tax efficiencies the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions including the united states to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements including our transfer pricing or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with the manner in which we report our income to the jurisdictions which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations   we may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all   we intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges including the need to develop new games and features or enhance our existing games improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses personnel and technologies accordingly we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds if we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities including potential acquisitions we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired and our business may be harmed risks related to this offering and ownership of our common stock the two class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial public offering including our founder and chief executive officer and our other executive officers and directors and their affiliates this limits our other stockholders’ and your ability to influence corporate matters   our series a preferred stock has  votes per share and our common stock which is the stock we are offering in this offering has one vote per share our founder and chief executive officer mr palexas beneficially owns approximately  of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock prior to and following the offering as a result mr palexas will continue to have significant influence over the management and affairs of the company and control over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future this concentrated voting control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock   future transfers or sales by holders of the series a preferred stock will result in those shares converting to common stock which will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those stockholders who retain their existing shares of series a or series b preferred stock our director and officer will control and make corporate decisions that may differ from those that might be made by the other shareholders due to the controlling amount of their share ownership in our company our director will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions including the power to prevent or cause a change in control his interests may differ from the interests of other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders        certain provisions in our charter documents and under florida law could limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors or current management and limit the market price of our common stock   provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our board of directors or management our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that · establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors · prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors and · reflect three classes of common stock as discussed above   these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our management our common stock price may be volatile due to thirdparty data regarding our games   third parties such as appdata publish daily data about us and other social game companies with respect to daus and maus and other information concerning social game usage in particular on facebook these metrics can be volatile particularly for specific games and in many cases do not accurately reflect the actual levels of usage of our games across all platforms and may not correlate to our bookings or revenue from the sale of virtual goods there is a possibility that third parties could change their methodologies for calculating these metrics in the future to the extent that securities analysts or investors base their views of our business or prospects on such thirdparty data the price of our class a common stock may be volatile and may not reflect the performance of our business   if securities or industry analysts do not publish research about our business or publish negative reports about our business our share price and trading volume could decline   the trading market for our common stock to some extent depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares our share price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline    if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected   if we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls for financial reporting in the future or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls as required pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports may be impacted or the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted      if we do not file a registration statement on form a to become a mandatory reporting company under section g of the securities exchange act of  exchange act we will continue as a reporting company and will not be subject to the proxy statement requirements and our officers directors and  stockholders will not be required to submit reports to the sec on their stock ownership and stock trading activity all of which could reduce the value of your investment and the amount of publicly available information about us in addition if we have less than  record shareholders at the beginning of any fiscal year other than the fiscal year within which this registration statement becomes effective our reporting obligations under section d of the exchange act will be suspended as a result of this offering as required under section d of the securities exchange act of  we will file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission for  months following the effectiveness of this offering including a form k for the year ended march   assuming this registration statement is declared effective before that date we are not required under section g or otherwise to become a mandatory exchange act filer unless we have more than  shareholders of which  may be unaccredited and total assets of more than  million on the  month anniversary of the effective date of this offering if we do not file a registration statement on form a at or prior to the  month anniversary of the effective date of this offering we will continue as a reporting company and will not be subject to the proxy statement requirements of the exchange act and our officers directors and  stockholders will not be required to submit reports to the sec on their stock ownership and stock trading activity there is also a significant risk that we will have less than  record shareholders at our next fiscal year end and at the conclusion of this offering if we have less than  record shareholders and have not filed a registration pursuant to a of the exchange act our reporting obligations under section d of the exchange act will be suspended and we would no longer be obligated to provide periodic reports following the form k for the fiscal year end immediately following this offering furthermore if at the beginning of any fiscal year we have fewer than  record shareholders for the class of securities being registered under this registration statement our reporting obligations under section d of the exchange act will be automatically suspended for that fiscal year if we were to cease reporting you will not have access to updated information regarding the companys business financial condition and results of operation  upon suspension of reporting obligations although the company may continue to file reports with the sec such filings will be voluntary  proxy requirements under rule a will thereupon cease  corporate events and shareholder notifications will be minimal and only to the standards of the state of florida  further for purposes of rule  generally holders of restricted stock will not be availed of those exemptions reserved for security holders of reporting issuers as defined therein the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members   we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act the doddfrank act and other applicable securities rules and regulations compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources the exchange act requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results   we also expect that being a public company subject to these rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee and qualified executive officers   as a result of disclosure of information in this prospectus and in filings required of a public company our business and financial condition have become more visible which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties if such claims are successful our business and operating results could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results            we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and as a result your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors accordingly investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments the shares being offered are defined as penny stock the rules imposed on the sale of the shares may affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase if at all the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a brokerdealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement prior to the sale in addition the brokerdealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in this offering in the public markets the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse stockholders should be aware that according to sec release no  the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse  such patterns include · control of the market for the security by one or a few brokerdealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer · manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases · boiler room practices involving highpressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons · excessive and undisclosed bidask differential and markups by selling brokerdealers and · the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and brokerdealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequential investor losses      our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of brokerdealers who participate in the market management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities the occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price shareholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock we have no committed source of financing other than the verbal agreement of our sole officer and director mr panayis palexas to meet the ongoing shortfalls in operational overheads up to a period not less than the end of fiscal   in addition as described elsewhere in this offering mr palexas has verbally agreed that all service provers controlled by mr palexis will accrue fees until such time as additional financing is secured sufficient to meet our operational overheads  we have no formal agreements in place with mr palexas evidencing these funding commitments wherever possible our board of directors will attempt to use noncash consideration to satisfy obligations in many instances we believe that the noncash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock our board of directors has authority without action or vote of the shareholders to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock in addition if a trading market develops for our common stock we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock possibly at a discount to market these actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders may further dilute common stock book value and that dilution may be material such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of the company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management you may not revoke your subscription agreement once it is accepted by the company or receive a refund of any funds advanced in connection with your accepted subscription agreement and as a result you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock     due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering there currently is no public trading market for our common stock therefore there is no central place such as a stock exchange or electronic trading system to resell your shares if you do want to resell your shares you will have to locate a buyer and negotiate your own sale we plan to contact a market maker to file an application on our behalf to have our common stock listed for quotation on the overthecounter bulletin board otcbb immediately following the effectiveness of this registration statement the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter otc securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements per se to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  or  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between zev ventures inc or anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities the lack of a public trading market for our shares may have a negative effect on your ability to sell your shares in the future and it also may have a negative effect on the price if any for which you may be able to sell your shares as a result an investment in the shares may be illiquid in nature and investors could lose some or all of their investment in the company   our shares may not become eligible to be traded electronically which would result in brokerage firms being unwilling to trade them if we become able to have our shares of common stock listed on the otcbb we will then try through a brokerdealer and its clearing firm to become eligible with the depository trust company dtc to permit our shares to trade electronically if an issuer is not dtceligible then its shares cannot be electronically transferred between brokerage accounts which based on the realities of the marketplace as it exists today means that shares of a company will not likely be traded our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with new or revised accounting standards  we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period that section  of the jobs act provides an emerging growth company as provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile our status as an emerging growth company under the jobs act of  may make it more difficult to raise capital when we need to do it because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an emerging growth company and because we will have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry if we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected we will not be required to comply with certain provisions of the sarbanesoxley act for as long as we remain an emerging growth company we are not currently required to comply with the sec rules that implement sections  and  of the sarbanesoxley act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose upon becoming a public company we will be required to comply with certain of these rules which will require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting though we will be required to disclose changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section  until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the sec or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act          our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the sec or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company at such time our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors as an emerging growth company we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without additional revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all our business plan allows for the estimated  cost of this registration statement to be paid from our cash on hand and related party loans going forward the company will have ongoing sec compliance and reporting obligations estimated as approximately  annually such ongoing obligations will require the company to expend additional amounts on compliance legal and auditing costs in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all   use of proceeds we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the selling shareholders’ shares of common stock registered herein determination of offering price as a result of

pursuant to this prospectus may be sold by one or more of the following methods   · ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the brokerdealer solicits the purchaser   · block trades in which the brokerdealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction   · purchases by a brokerdealer as principal and resale by the brokerdealer for its account   · an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange   · privatelynegotiated transactions or   · brokerdealers may agree with the selling security holders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share   the selling security holders may also sell shares under rule  under the securities act if available rather than under this prospectus   we currently lack a public market for our common stock selling shareholders will sell at a price of  per share until our shares are quoted on the otc bulletin board and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices   the offering price of the shares has been arbitrarily determined by us based on estimates of the price that purchasers of speculative securities such as the shares offered herein will be willing to pay considering the nature and capital structure of our company the experience of the officers and directors and the market conditions for the sale of equity securities in similar companies the offering price of the shares bears no relationship to the assets earnings or book value of our company or any other objective standard of value we believe that only a small number of shares if any will be sold by the selling shareholders prior to the time our common stock is quoted on the otc bulletin board at which time the selling shareholders will sell their shares based on the market price of such shares the company is not selling any shares pursuant to this registration statement and is only registering the resale of securities previously purchased from us    the selling security holders may pledge their shares to their brokers under the margin provisions of customer agreements if a selling security holder defaults on a margin loan the broker may from time to time offer and sell the pledged shares   the antimanipulation provisions of regulation m under the

engaged in the distribution of the shares neither selling security holders nor their agents shall bid for purchase or attempt to induce any person to bid for or purchase shares of our common stock while they are distributing shares covered by this prospectus   accordingly the selling security holders are not permitted to cover short sales by purchasing shares while the distribution is taking place we will advise the selling security holders that if a particular offer of common stock is to be made on terms materially different from the information set forth in this plan of distribution then a posteffective amendment to the accompanying registration statement must be filed with the securities and exchange commission   brokerdealers engaged by the selling security holders may arrange for other brokerdealers to participate in sales brokerdealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling security holders or if any brokerdealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares from the purchaser in amounts to be negotiated it is not expected that these commissions and discounts will exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved     the selling security holders may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of the securities act in connection with such sales therefore any commissions received by such brokerdealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the securities act          penny stock regulation our common shares are not quoted on any stock exchange or quotation system the sec has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange system the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec that · contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading · contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties · contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including “bid” and “ask” prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price · contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions · defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks and · contains such other information and is in such form including language type size and format as the sec shall require by rule or regulation the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with the following prior to proceeding with any transaction in a penny stock · bid and offer quotations for the penny stock · details of the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction · the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and · monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement these disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities offering period and expiration date   this offering will start on the date this registration statement is declared

for a share of the social casino game market are game developers including caesars interactive zynga igtdoubledown big fish games jackpot party doubleu and others being first to market with an established user base places those top ten market players in an advantageous position over new arrivals although there are many casino apps and many new app entries the top ten still manage to hold onto  of the market for a new entry to make any significant inroads a substantial investment in brand awareness over time will need to be made in the social media space brand awareness backed by an excellent product and a clever ongoing marketing campaign that is consistently implemented will ensure that a new market entry can gain the brand recognition and positioning needed to compete successfully as the social casino game industry grows and the barriers to entry are lowered for new market entrants more and more new entrants will be investing time and money to get their piece of this market what has been shown to be true is that although entry is relatively easy the market still dictates survival of the fittest a strong skill in the art of great game development coupled with deep pockets for marketing determines who gets to keep the lion’s share of this business this will remain true in the future the company owns a competitive and unique social casino app no other social casino app to date offers the same or similar game unlocking features or overall challenge mechanics by utilizing game media works ltd’s game library we are able to reduce our outlay cost and increase our chances of developing successful and proven slot games              talent sources and names of principal suppliers on april   the company entered into an agreement with game media works ltd a

fee equal to  of the monthly gross income generated by the games on april   the company entered into an agreement with panash sac a company owned by our president panayis palexas under the agreement the provider will develop creative ads manage social media networks maintain and engage existing users via social media networks create positing and manage the company’s facebook fan page  in addition the provider will ensure brand positioning and increase awareness as well we grow and retain users  the provider will be paid by the company for its services with a minimum of  monthly or  of monthly revenue earned by the application the provider is servicing this amount will not exceed of  per month dependence on one or a few major customers although the company is not dependent upon a few major customers it is duly noted that access to the company’s software for end users is through facebook applications as our sole customer access  we are confident in our ability to adjust to changing protocols rules and regulations put forth by facebook however these efforts could be detrimental to our focus on continued growth patents trademarks licenses agreements or contracts our business is significantly based on the creation acquisition use and protection of intellectual property some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to enable them to run properly on multiple platforms other intellectual property we create includes audiovisual elements including graphics music story lines and interface design we presently have no patents on this intellectual property   while most of the intellectual property we use is created by us we have acquired rights to proprietary intellectual property from game media works ltd a company  controlled by our sole officer and director panayis palexas  whereby game media works ltd  grants to the company a nonexclusive nontransferable and individual license making the casino games jackpot games and branded games “the system” available to end users to play via the internet using the cleo’s casino proprietary platform for a term of  years from april     we protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights as well as contractual restrictions we will control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees upon hire and all contractors as well as confidentiality agreements with third parties we also actively engage in monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to infringing uses of our intellectual property by third parties   we  may also seek patent protection when appropriate and when funding permits covering inventions originating from the company and acquire patents we believe may be useful or relevant to our business        in addition to these contractual arrangements we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark trade dress domain name and patents to protect our games and other intellectual property we typically own the copyright to the software code to our content as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our games are marketed we pursue the registration of our domain names trademarks and service marks in the united states and in locations outside the united states   circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the united states or other countries in which our games are distributed also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and timeconsuming any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business thereby harming our operating results   companies in the internet games social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights from time to time we have faced and we expect to face in the future allegations by third parties including our competitors and nonpracticing entities that we have infringed their trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights as we face increasing competition and as our business grows we will likely face more claims of infringement government regulation we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business in the united states and internationally laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts unfair competition copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched the ads posted or the content provided by users any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business we are potentially subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types of content such as that which depicts violence many of which are ill defined still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or expose us to liability   in addition rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct such as the unauthorized dissemination of national security information money laundering or supporting terrorist activities may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our games or restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business              some of our games are based upon traditional casino games such as poker we have structured and operate our slotmachine game cleo’s casino  with the gambling laws in mind and believe that playing cleo’s casino does not constitute gambling we also sometimes offer our players various types of sweepstakes giveaways and promotion opportunities we are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services could result in criminal or civil liability and could harm our business   in the area of information security and data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as the  amendment to california’s information practices act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities   we are also subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of player data we post our privacy policy and terms of service online in which we describe our practices concerning the use transmission and disclosure of player data any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others which could harm our business in addition the interpretation of data protection laws and their application to the internet is unclear and in a state of flux there is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state country to country or region to region and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices further any failure by us to adequately protect our players’ privacy and data could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of players which could adversely affect our business   in addition because our services are accessible worldwide certain foreign jurisdictions have claimed and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity employees or infrastructure employees and consultants the company does not have any employees

a public entity subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements we estimate that these accounting legal and other professional costs would be a minimum of  in the next yearand will be higher in the following years if our business volume and activity increases increased business activity could greatly increase our professional fees for reporting requirements and this could have a significant impact on future operating costs the difference between having the ability to sustain our cash flow requirements over the next twelve months and the need for additional outside funding will depend on how fast we can generate sales revenue   we have no plans to undertake any substantive product research and development during the next  months as we secure a user base for our initial app cleo’s casino  currently all updates tweaks game integration is managed by third party service provider game media works ltd for all games under license as we secure funds to implement our business plan we will retain employees to expand our offering of app’s and expect at that time to incur more substantive research and development costs   increasing the company’s userplayer base is the fundamental driver to increasing revenue and achieving profitable operations   as such the key factor in the company’s annual budget outside costs of standard overhead payable to third party service providers audit bookkeeping and legal services and for general and administrative expenses is the allocation of funds to our facebook advertising and marketing program the company’s business model provides for the acquisition of a database of as many daily “purchasing users” as possible with an average daily spend estimated at day or approximately  per month the company’s operating history to date and management’s experience in the industry suggest this is a reasonable target for its financial projections we hope to ultimately achieve a database of up to  users with  to  of the database making a virtual currency purchase each month  presently we have a database of over  users with approximately  purchasing users on a monthly basis  our projections call for a marketing spend of  for each new user acquired and we have allocated our marketing and advertising budget as to  new user acquisition and  user retention to accelerate our growth  the advertising and marketing spend directly correlates to new users as reflected in our historical operating figures  the larger the user database grows the lower the spend to engage and retain users and the more profitable the app will become as our purchasing user rate increases month over month  presently between  and  of our total user database are purchasing players each month should the company achieve funding of  million as proposed in this offering we will allocate  million to a dedicated  month user expansion plan which should increase our daily purchasing players to between  and  users over the term of the program at an estimated spend of  per player per month in this manner we expect to generate sufficient revenues to become profitable within  months of implementation of the program   the remaining proceeds shall be allocated as follow up marketing during fiscal  with a  reduction to our monthly advertising spend  in financing proceeds shall be used to settle accrued payables and advances and as to payment of cost of financing   until such time as the company is able to raise capital for rapid expansion our sole officer and director has agreed to continue to fund our operations   at a minimum mr palexas has verbally agreed to spend  per day on advertising and marketing efforts and to accrue associated costs from the third party service providers controlled by him as our monthly revenue increases our prior operating history current purchasing user rates and new user retention projections indicate that with a minimal advertising spend of  per day approx year we should be able to generate revenues to offset a substantive portion of our basic operating overhead including the services provided by unrelated parties and all professional fees we expect to achieve minimum gross revenues of  which net of processing costs provides for approximately  in gross profit  our total anticipated overhead costs for fiscal  are detailed below including related party services provided             costs of reporting including professional fees filing fees        advertising at  per day        server hosting costs        marketing fees related party        general overhead        total     we expect the capital required from mr palexas and his controlled entities for the next  months of operations to be approximately  to meet the shortfall dependent on the actual allocated adverting and marketing spend  the majority of the anticipated shortfalls approx  represents amounts payable to service providers controlled by mr palexas under licensing and marketing contracts which amounts will be accrued until such time as the company reaches profitable operations or is successful in raising additional capital  with this program we should increase our daily purchasing players from  at present to approximately  with an estimated spend of  per month or  per day per user   we have no formal agreements in place with mr palexas evidencing these commitments we will seek to raise up to  in order to fully implement our business plan including our planned future operations which includes substantive funding for marketing and development of new product for our online apps   at presently the company

stock with no comparable expense in the prior comparative period  net losses for the nine months totaled   and   respectively   liquidity and capital resources our sole officer and related entities have funded our shortfall in operational capital to date and haveagreed to advance funds as needed to allow the business to operate  until such time as outside financing is secured or profitable operations are achieved while mr palexas has agreed to advance thesefunds the agreement is verbal and is unenforceable as a matter of law we received our initial funding of  through the sale of common stock to those shareholders listed herein and moneys advanced by our officer and director the purchasing shareholders purchased a total of  shares of our common stock at  per share prior to september    of this amount a total of  shares were acquired by our sole officer and director   we do not presently have sufficient funds on hand to pay for the expenses related to this offering or meet all of our operational expenses as well as planned expansion costs at a minimum mr palexas has verbally agreed to spend  per day on advertising and marketing efforts as we seek a larger financing and to accrue associated costs from the third party service providers controlled by him until such time as there is sufficient cash flow to pay these amounts as they come due  at this rate of funding the company can continue to expand our business by approximately  to  purchasing users over the coming twelve months and expect to record gross revenues of approximately  in a twelve month period we expect the capital required from mr palexas and his controlled entities for the next  months of operations to be approximately  to meet the shortfall dependent on the actual allocated adverting and marketing spend  the majority of the anticipated shortfalls approx  represents amounts payable to service providers controlled by mr palexas under licensing and marketing contracts which amounts will be accrued until such time as the company reaches profitable operations or is successful in raising additional capital  with this program we should increase our daily purchasing players from  at present to approximately  with an estimated spend of  per month or  per day per user   we have no formal agreements in place with mr palexas evidencing these commitments we will seek to raise up to  in order to fully implement our business plan including our planned future operations which includes substantive funding for marketing and development of new product for our online apps   currently we do not have sufficient capital to fully implement our business development we will seek to raise up to an additional  to fully implement our business development plan  however if we fail to raise additional funds in the future we believe we can continue to grow our business at a conservative rate over the next  months though we will would not have yet achieved profitable operations working capital total current assets as of december   were  a decrease of  compared to  as of march   the decrease in current assets is primarily attributable to general operating expenses settled in the period   total current liabilities as of december   were  a decrease of  compared to  as of march   the substantive decrease in current liabilities is entirely due to the decrease in accounts payable related party as a result of the conversion of  of accounts payable into  shares of series a preferred stock of the company the conversion of  in payables into shares of common stock and a total of  settled by way of a private placement for shares at   these reductions were offset by an increase to accounts payable as a result of an inability of the company to meet obligations as they came due      cash flow cash used in operating activities cash used in operating activities totaling  increased substantially during the nine months ended december   compared to  of cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended december   the increase was primarily due to expenditure of more cash as a result of increased operations   cash used in investing activities   there was no cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended december   and  respectively   cash provided by financing activities   cash provided by financing activities increased  during the nine months ended december   as there was no cash provided by financing activities for the prior comparative nine months ended december    the cash provided by investing activities was as a result of the sale of common stock   cash requirements   we anticipate that our operating and other expenses will increase significantly as we continue to implement our business plan and pursue our operational goals we estimate that our cash requirements for our fiscal year ending march   will be between  and  based on the success we have in raising additional capital and the marketing efforts we undertake we do not presently have sufficient funds on hand to pay for the expenses related to this offering or meet all of our operational expenses as well as planned expansion costs at a minimum mr palexas has verbally agreed to spend  per day on advertising and marketing efforts as we seek a larger financing and to accrue associated costs from the third party service providers controlled by him until such time as there is sufficient cash flow to pay these amounts as they come due  at this rate of funding the company can continue to expand our business by approximately  to  purchasing users over the coming twelve months and expect to record gross revenues of approximately  in a twelve month period we expect the capital required from mr palexas and his controlled entities for the next  months of operations to be approximately  to meet the shortfall dependent on the actual allocated adverting and marketing spend  the majority of the anticipated shortfalls approx  represents amounts payable to service providers controlled by mr palexas under licensing and marketing contracts which amounts will be accrued until such time as the company reaches profitable operations or is successful in raising additional capital  with this program we should increase our daily purchasing players from  at present to approximately  with an estimated spend of  per month or  per day per user   we have developed use of proceeds for our gaming expansion plans for various investment amounts ranging from the minimum of  up to  in available capital  the speed with which we grow and achieve profitability is directly related to our initial and ongoing marketing expenditures however we expect to be profitable at or prior to march  dependent on our success in raising additional capital above the minimum capital requirements we will implement a marketing program which fits our available funds   should we be successful in raising total proceeds of  we will implement an aggressive marketing and

directors approved an amendment to the articles of incorporation to increase to the authorized share capital from  to  common shares the effect of this action is retroactively impacted in these financial statements note   summary of significant accounting policies  use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods actual results could materially differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents   for purposes of reporting within the statements of cash flows the company considers all cash on hand cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents   revenue recognition   we derive revenue from the sale of virtual goods associated with our online games as well as from services provided for customer events all sales are recorded in accordance with asc   revenue recognition   revenue is recognized when all the criteria have been met   • when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists • the services have been provided to the customer • the fee is fixed or determinable • collectability is reasonably assured online game we operate our flagship social gaming application “cleo’s casino” cleo’s casino is available on facebook google play and the apple app store cleo casino generates revenue through the sale of virtual currency to players that they may exchange to play at any of our licensed online slot machines video poker machines hold’em style poker tables or for other features and experiences available within cleo casino players can pay for our virtual currency       f   trupal media inc notes to audited financial statements march   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued online game cont’d using facebook credits or facebook local currency payments when playing our games through facebook and can use other payment methods such as credit cards or paypal on other platforms   revenue from the sale of virtual currency to players is recognized when the service has been provided to the player assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we have determined that an implied obligation exists by the company to the paying player to continue displaying the purchased virtual goods within the online game over their estimated life or until they are consumed we recognize revenue upon the sale of the game credits to the customer and receive such amounts from the payment processor within a period of  days from the sale to the customer cost of revenue   our cost of revenue consists primarily of the direct expenses incurred in order to generate revenue such costs are recorded as incurred our cost of revenue consists primarily of virtual good transaction fees paid to platform operators such as facebook google amazon and apple  we also record costs related to the fulfillment of specific customer advertising campaigns fair value of financial instruments   the company’s financial instruments consist of cash receivables payables and due to related party the carrying amount of cash receivables and payables approximates fair value because of the shortterm nature of these items the carrying amount of the notes payable approximates fair value as the individual borrowings bear interest at market interest rates   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” topic  income taxes which requires that the company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse deferred income tax benefit expense results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized research and development and capitalized software development costs research and development expenses with respect to the company’s online gaming platform including consulting services internal costs for payroll overhead and related expenses of its technology development and other employees directly involved in the application development are charged to expense as incurred in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no  sfas no  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed  while the company has launched its application has determined technological feasibility and is generating revenues from the sale of virtual currency due to the limited cash flow to date the company does not yet consider it has reached the threshold
