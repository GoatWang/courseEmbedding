by the end of summer of  we require additional financing to implement our plan of operation and sustain business operations currently we do not have any arrangements for financing and we may be unable to obtain financing when required obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors including the companys ability to attract customers the company may be unable to access to capital markets in the future or that financing adequate to satisfy the cash requirements of implementing our business strategies will be available on acceptable terms the inability of the company to gain access to capital markets or obtain acceptable financing could have a material adverse effect upon the results of its operations and upon its financial conditions going concern our auditor has indicated in their reports on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended february   and february   that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations deficit in equity and the need to raise additional capital to fund operations a going concern opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities table of contents results of operations fiscal year ended february   compared to the fiscal year ended february   we did not earn any revenues from february   inception to february   during the fiscal year ended february   we incurred operating expenses of  comprised of office and general expenses of  professional fees in the amount of  and

increases in transfer agent fees and website expenses capital resources and liquidity our auditors report on our february   financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business since our sole director maybe unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next  months we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans see february   audited financial statements  auditors report as of february   we had  of cash compared to  of cash as of february   we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from financing activities will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next  months to date the company has incurred operating losses since inception of  as at february   the company has a working capital deficit of  the company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty we expect to incur marketing and professional and administrative expenses as well expenses associated with maintaining our filings with the commission we will require additional funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital if we are unable to obtain additional financing we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities which could harm our business plans financial condition and operating results additional funding may not be available on favorable terms if at all the company intends to continue to fund its business by way of equity or debt financing and advances from related parties any inability to raise capital as needed would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we cannot raise additional funds we will have to cease business operations as a result investors in the companys common stock would lose
