reviews ›   u reviewed by unsatisfied jul   is this place a joke are we on camera our business gets a refund check in the mail it states refund for card balance i called the banks   because were not in mi the csr tells me that due to privacy i need to take the check to our bank and have them call the   to see if theres enough funds they do not know if they have enough funds in their own bank hahahaha thats when i asked if i was on candid camera yes thatll show you my age and clearly asked if this was a freakin joke she said well the only thing i can tell you is if the bank account is opened or closed ummmm what a waste of my banks time were a repair shop in a completely different state so customers have paid us through their online banking however the amount doesnt match any outstanding balance and its made from comerica card operations we have no card so now that this bank sucks clearly through the reviews i have read but they suck so bad that theyre now scamming people in other states to recoup money i say that because thats the only thing i can think of them doing at this point jerks thank you for your feedback is this review helpful yes  no    c reviewed by cheld jul   do not get a heloc from comerica we obtained a heloc from comerica in december  since then it has been a nightmare trying to gain access to the money i wrote a check from the account but the loan department would not approve it the heloc department did not even have record of our heloc account in addition at the time there were some type of changes at the bank and i was directed to several numbers to call i finally went to the vvl branch i spent  minutes at the vvl branch trying to get the loan department to approve the amount not even near the full line of credit since the mesa branch is too far from my home finally the branch also after several attempts and numbers to call reached someone in the correct loan department the bank approved the check amount finally  even though the loan department would not since then it has been a nightmare trying to get the money the computer system is antiquated you cannot transfer from the heloc to the comerica checking additional heloc checks were sent to the wrong address figure that one out and after filling out an interest only form at the beginning of the process and again in june the full amount is still being deducted the first six months is a great interest ratetoo bad you cannot get the money out from the account i specifically needed the amount for home things but every time i tried to use it immediately it was not approved very embarrassing i was told i would have to go into the branch for approval does not make sense at all i was told to use the debit cardwhich defeats the purpose of using the money conveniently many vendors charge a high percentage to use a debit cardplusit probably would not have worked avoid the heloc from this bank you cannot get the money anyway sincerely disappointed

increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes financial aid and many consumer goods and services it now costs on average  per year for tuition fees room and board for a fouryear private college assuming a collegecost inflation rate of  today’s yearold child may need  come college time in  “for parents the numberone goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement but close behind is paying for a child’s education” says marc dextraze executive director morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions it takes a village to raise a child but in  it may take an extended family to educate one tweet this share this on linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save or even pay in advance for college expenses earnings in a  plan can be tax deferred and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition fees room and board and supplies many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that making education a family affair motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education grandparents relatives and even family friends have also begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there including ks s and others it’s using all of the available tools that’s how you reach your goals” morgan stanley offers many s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies you can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
