exchange investment ideas lake sunapee bank group naslsbg graham number gurufnaslsbggraham number  as of sep  graham number is a figure that measures a stocks fundamental value by taking into account the companys earnings per share and book value per share the graham number is the upper bound of the price range that a defensive investor should pay for the stock according to the theory any stock price below the graham number is considered undervalued and thus worth investing in as of today the stock price of lake sunapee bank group is  lake sunapee bank groups graham number for the quarter that ended in sep  was  therefore lake sunapee bank groups price to graham number ratio for today is  graham number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation it is a very conservative way of valuing a stock definition graham number is a concept based on ben grahams conservative valuation of companies lake sunapee bank groups graham number for the fiscal year that ended in dec  is calculated as graham number sqrt of tangible book value per shareeps without nonrecurring items nri sqrt of   lake sunapee bank groups graham number for the quarter that ended in sep  is calculated as graham number sqrt of tangible book value per shareeps without nonrecurring items nri ttm sqrt of    all numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio all numbers are in their local exchanges currency explanation ben graham actually did not publish a formula like this but he wrote in the intelligent investor  version regarding to the criteria for purchases current price should not be more than  times average earnings of the past three years current price should not be more than  times the book value last reported however a multiplier of earnings below  could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets as a rule of thumb we suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed  this figure corresponds to  times earnings and  times book value it would admit an issue selling at only  times earnings and  times asset value etc unlike valuation methods such as dcf or discounted earnings the graham number does not take growth into the valuation unlike the valuation methods based on book value alone it takes into account the earnings power therefore the graham number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation in general the graham number is a very conservative way of valuing a stock it cannot be applied to companies with negative book values lake sunapee bank groups price to graham number ratio for today is calculated as price to graham numbershare price todaygraham number q sep      all numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio all numbers are in their local exchanges currency be aware please keep these in mind  graham number does not take growth into account therefore it underestimates the values of the companies that have good earnings growth we feel that if the earnings per share grows more than  a year graham number underestimates the value  graham number punishes the companies that have temporarily low earnings therefore an average of earnings makes more sense in the calculation of graham number  graham numbers underestimates companies that are light with book related terms earnings per share without nonrecurring items
