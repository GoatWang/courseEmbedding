circular for caprocq investors must review the offering circular for caprocq and sign a subscription agreement attesting that they reviewed the offering circular before making an investment in caprocq caprocq core risk factors prospective investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the companys common stock involves a high and sometimes speculative degree of risk and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate the risks of the investment an investment in our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of and to withstand the total loss of their investment prospective investors should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to purchase shares it is impossible to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares of the companys common stock because of general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate the risks associated with the types of properties the company intends to acquire and certain tax risks among other risks these risks may be exacerbated by the additional risks associated with the specific properties that the company acquires and the ownership structure of the investment such specific risks include but are not limited to high vacancy rates tenants in possession but not paying rent tenants paying rent but who have gone dark properties that need substantial capital improvements andor repositioning in their local markets properties that are not generating income and risks relating to joint venture and coinvestor structures in addition prospective investors must rely solely upon the advisor to identify investment opportunities and to negotiate any debt financing prospective investors who are unwilling to rely solely on the advisor should not invest in our shares each prospective investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering and should consult with his own legal tax and financial advisors with respect thereto prior to investing in shares of the companys common stock examples of a few risks in this offering are the following • upon raising the minimum offering amount we will only own one investment • our advisor may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities • investments in real estaterelated assets can be speculative • adverse economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and as a result our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize appreciation in the value of our investments • reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity • we may have conflicts of interest with our advisor and other affiliates which could result in investment decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders • we have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness which increases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments • a limit on the percentage of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business combination which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium price for their stock • the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly prior to this offering there has been no public market for caprocq core reit incs common stock therefore our company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its common stock will develop or be sustained after this offering or how the development of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock for a complete discussion of risks please refer to the
