it offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation combat vehicles weapons systems and munitions communications and information technology systems and solutions and shipbuilding we operate globally through four business groups aerospace combat systems marine systems and information systems and technology the aerospace group comprised of gulfstream aerospace corporation and jet aviation is at the forefront of the businessjet industry  the combat systems group comprised of land systems european land systems and ordnance and tactical systems provides a full spectrum of combat vehicles weapons systems and munitions for the us and its allies  the marine systems group comprised of electric boat bath iron works and nassco is a marketleading designer and builder of nuclearpowered submarines surface combatants and auxiliary and combat logistics ships for the us navy and jones act ships for commercial customers  the information systems and technology group comprised of mission systems and information technology provides technologies products and services for a wide range of customers stem narrativestem is essential to the technological superiority of the united states military  the defense industry working handinhand with our military customer provides us service members with the best technology and capabilities in the world  this qualitative advantage is itself a force for peace our enemies must consider the presence of capable men and women operating the most sophisticated weaponry available deployed around the world  that technological overmatch can only persist if our defense industry continues to have the finest stem professionals in the world general dynamics employs nearly  stem professionals across our ten business units at all levels of the workforce  in the past a company’s stem professionals were in the management workforce and the labor workforce was devoted to touch labor  today however we need significant stem knowledge across every part of the workforce  our products are simply too complicated and our manufacturing processes simply too streamlined to function any other way  today we undertake manufacturing operations without conventional engineering drawings but rather employ a digital system which provides realtime updates  the degree of technological savvy of  our workforce at all levels is breathtaking and it is increasing  whether our employees come into the workforce with a stem foundation from high school technical school college or graduate school we build upon that foundation to provide the advanced specialized knowledge required for the pace of innovation our customers demand at general dynamics we also believe that a stem background is conducive to problem solving  stem professionals are accustomed to working together to proceed carefully and logically through a problem  in today’s complex world we need people who are interested in finding solutions  real problemsolving requires innovation rigor and intellectual discipline  those things are not exclusively found in the stem fields but they are certainly found there in high concentrations  simply put the world today needs problemsolvers and stem education produces problemsolvers stem professionals are also highlysuited for our culture of continuous improvement  the dedication many of our stem professionals have to continuous improvement allows us to achieve cost schedule and capability gains year after year  they are conditioned to ask constantly whether we can do better and then to work to achieve results what traits do corporate leaders need to effectively support and advance stem education todaywe look for our corporate leaders to have a strong baseline in stem or at least a willingness to learn  at general dynamics no level of leadership has the luxury of dismissing technical issues  we are all stem leaders at every level and we are engaging with our stem workforce on technical issues at general dynamics our senior leaders believe that it is a central part of their job to train the next generation of leaders  this is especially important in our stem workforce given the highly specialized complex products we offer  today there are thousands of engineers at general dynamics electric boat working to design the nextgeneration ballistic missile submarine  that submarine will be in service until   quite literally we are building the military of the future and it is impossible to do so without the best engineering talent in the world  whether they are building advanced military communications networks submarines or surface naval combatants combat vehicles or business jets our engineers need the kind of specialized training that can be found only on a job site  that’s why we invest daily in recruiting training and workforce development for our stem professionals in addition we promote our stem professionals  i believe that both students and young stem professionals need to be able to look one two or several levels up in the organization and see people who have serious technical skills and knowledge and a stem education  our stem professionals know that their stem knowledge is a prerequisite for nearly all of our most important leadership positions finally like many companies we believe that it is helpful in advancing stem education to offer opportunities to promising students so that they can gain valuable exposure to complex problems of design engineering and manufacturing  at many of our businesses these programs are a critical pipeline to stem talent so it is a mutually beneficial relationship how is your company infusing diversity in stem initiativesgiven the breadth of our products our engineering challenges are among the most complex in the industry  i have long believed that one of the key benefits of a heterogeneous workforce is that it brings about diversity of thought  we need people from diverse backgrounds because they bring a different view to a problem which might well have been missed in a more homogenous environment  as many have noted however some groups have typically been underrepresented in stem careers  for this reason general dynamics has sought to support the effort to encourage more minorities to enter the stem fields and was named a top  employer by workforce diversity magazine last year  at all levels of leadership we stress the importance of diversity of thought and we use that principle to drive recruitment of diverse candidates for our stem jobs phebe n novakovic

conference call all participants will be in listenonly mode please note this event is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to alison harbrecht staff vp of investor relations please go ahead alison harbrecht  general dynamics corp thank you gary and good morning everyone welcome to the general dynamics first quarter  conference call any forwardlooking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the companys outlook these estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties additional information regarding these factors is contained in the companys k and q filings with that i would like to turn the call over to our chairman and chief executive officer phebe novakovic phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp thanks alison and good morning alison has replaced erin linnihan who is now reporting to me in a different capacity alison has had a distinguished year career in the finance department most recently as the controller for mission systems we are pleased to have her here as our staff vp for investor relations as to the quarter commentary i will keep my remarks brief since this quarters results are relatively straightforward quite good and the comparisons are generally attractive we reported earnings per share of  on revenue somewhat in excess of  billion operating earnings of slightly over  billion and net earnings of  million eps of  was  better than consensus we estimate that about  of that  was from operations in the form of higher than expected operating margins offset modestly by somewhat lower than expected revenue the remainder came from a lower effective tax rate offset slightly by a somewhat higher than anticipated share count with respect to cash we had  million net cash provided by operating activities after capital expenditure of  million we had  million of free cash flow from operations  million more than in the yearago quarter while our total backlog at  billion is down  billion from yearend figures it remains quite robust it is also significant to observe that the important funded portion of that backlog grew by approximately  billion to  billion an impressive  of our total backlog is funded the general comparisons quarter over quarter reflect as you would expect strong operating performance all of the comparisons i will give you are with reference to  numbers as restated for the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules for this year so compared to the first quarter of  revenue was down  million or  however our operating earnings were up  million or  over the prior years quarter on the strength of a  basis point improvement in operating margin the operating margin in the quarter at  was particularly strong on a sequential basis revenue was down  million or  but again operating earnings were up  million or  on a  basis point improvement in margin all of the foregoing is a reflection of very positive operating leverage finally eps from continuing operations was up  up  over the yearago quarter as a result a better operating earnings and a lower tax rate and share count let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results in each of our operating segments first aerospace revenue was up by  million compared to q  about  and up  million or  sequentially similarly operating earnings were up  million or  against the yearago quarter on a  basis point expansion in operating margin sequentially operating earnings were up  million on a  basis point improvement in operating margin the sequential result needs to be understood in the context of the restated  revenue and earnings resulting from the new revenue recognition rules in the fourth quarter we had nine more green aircraft receive a certificate of airworthiness than we had final deliveries to customers this negatively impacted q  as restated because the green deliveries were no longer recognized by the same token we had four more entryintoservice deliveries in q  than we had green aircraft receive a certificate of airworthiness that obviously helped the first quarter of  and should help next quarter as well orders for the group were typical of a first quarter in the quarter net earnings were  billion and the dollarbased booktobill was  this is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of  through  the aerospace average booking for the first quarter over the last five years were  billion a booktobill of about  so it was a quarter with a lot of sales pipeline replenishment it was part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter in particular we noted sharp increases in activity levels in europe and improved activity in china i should also note that the activity has been good in april and has clearly shifted in favor of largecabin this is quite encouraging on the product development front we anticipate a lateoctober completion of all flight test requirements for the g this leads us to believe that faa certification will follow within  days thereafter by the way we are going to fly our third g test airplane today think about it this way we are flying three test airplanes in the first  months since first flight really quite remarkable so we are off to a very good start in the aerospace group somewhat better than our guidance to you at the operating earnings level we expected a strong first quarter for the reasons we discussed with you at the beginning of the year however the operating performance was better than expected let me turn to the defense side of the business with combat systems compared to the first quarter of  sales were up  million or  and operating earnings were up  million or  on a  basis point improvement in operating margin we had particularly strong performance on a quarter to yearago quarter basis from european land systems sequentially revenue was down  million but operating earnings were down only  million on a  basis point improvement in operating margin the sequential comparison is particularly difficult on a revenue basis because this group always has a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract deliveries at ots and els also in the quarter we largely completed the transition from engineering and prototype production on our two large international vehicle programs for canada the mideast and the uk these programs will now enter full production and continue apace for the next several years even given combats large backlog they had nice order activity in the quarter with a  times booktobill all in all extremely strong operating performance once again at combat systems with respect to information systems and technology we experienced very good operating leverage in the quarter while revenue was down  million or  against the yearago quarter and down  million sequentially operating earnings of  million were essentially flat with the yearago quarter on the strength of an  basis point improvement in margin on a sequential basis operating earnings were up  million once again on an  basis point improvement in operating margin these results are consistent with our guidance of an around  operating margin i think its important to note that ists backlog grew by  million in the quarter with a booktobill of  times following strong booktobill of to on average for the last four years the significant orders in the quarter included a  million contract from the uk ministry of defence to design and develop its nextgeneration communication and information system  million from the nato communication and information agency to upgrade its technical infrastructure and  million from the national geospatial intelligence agency for the new campus east so a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective at ist finally lets turn to marine revenue of  billion was down  million or  compared to the yearago quarter but up  million or  sequentially operating earnings were down  million or  against the yearago quarter and up  million sequentially the revenue variance from the yearago quarter was solely attributable to lower virginiaclass block  material volume offset only partially by higher columbiaclass engineering volume and higher repair volume earnings were driven by a delay in the scheduled delivery on one ship in block  of our virginiaclass submarine program our performance on the virginiaclass program continues to be solid also at eb we are already over  complete on the design of the columbiaclass ballistic missile submarine four years before start of construction this performance is far better than any submarine firstofclass design maturity to construction start date in history so we are pleased baths shipovership performance on the remainder of the ddg s is outstanding and we have stabilized the ddg  nassco continues to show performance improvement on each of its ships so the company is off to a very good start to the year somewhat ahead of our expectations we do not as a practice change guidance at the end of the first quarter it is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based as always we will continue to consolidate our improvements and strive to continue to improve our results id like to turn the call over now to our cfo jason aiken jason w aiken  general dynamics corp thank you phebe and good morning net interest expense in the quarter was  million versus  million in the first quarter of  the increase was due to a  million increase in our outstanding debt last year on the capital deployment front we spent  million on the repurchase of  million shares in the first quarter when you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments we spent  million in shareholderfriendly actions during the first quarter almost  of our free cash flow from operations we continue to anticipate deploying all of our free cash flow this year to share repurchases and dividends we ended the quarter with a cash balance of  billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of  billion as phebe mentioned our effective tax rate was  for the quarter the lower first quarter rate was anticipated based on the timing of the vesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefits and is consistent with our fullyear tax rate forecast so despite coming out of the gate with a lower rate were still anticipating an effective tax rate of about  for the year alison that concludes my remarks and ill turn it back over to you for the qa alison harbrecht  general dynamics corp thanks jason as a reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate if you have additional questions please get back into the queue gary can you please remind the participants how to enter the queue questionandanswer session operator the first question comes from robert spingarn with credit suisse please go ahead robert m spingarn  credit suisse good morning phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp good morning robert m spingarn  credit suisse so phebe as you said good performance across the board in marine youve got a lot going on i wanted to ask you about that its a multipart question but it really gets to capex over the next several years with the columbia class coming in a construction contract rumored to be around  billion you have the advanced procurement money that went into the december cr thats nearly i guess  billion and then weve got this very ambitious ship force structure assessment where large surface combatants go up from something like  to  attack submarines go up from  to  going from two per year perhaps to three same with the destroyers given that how do we think about the requirement for you – for gd to invest in capex over the next several years phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so let me give you our investment philosophy across the board we invest in programs that we believe we can earn a sufficient and proper return so to the extent that those returns become increasingly clear that then informs our investment and thats true across the entirety of our portfolio so i think you need to think about our investment proposition through that lens with respect to the increase in shipbuilding to the extent that that materializes and we can understand both the quantum and the timing of those increases we have the capacity to increase production in each of our shipyards as does the majority of our supply base but with all of these – with any increase in production we would need to replenish as needed our workforce the supplier base and facilities over time and again all of the potential investments with respect to that growth will be determined with our customer as we begin to identify the return robert m spingarn  credit suisse so phebe would we go through a period where there is some pressure on cash flow from the added capex and maybe pressure on margins as you hire and prepare for future higher revenue phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so our current plan anticipates an investment in our shipbuilding program commensurate with what we see the growth to be so we may see in the out years some cash demands as a result of those investments but i believe it will be well within our capabilities and remember too the cash thats tied up at gulfstream will begin to unwind naturally as well so we will consider all of those puts and takes as we think about our investment into the future you had a second part of that robert m spingarn  credit suisse i was simply talking about the possible impact to margins as you start to hire and so forth yes phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so we have done a very careful plan on what our margin expectations are and we see our margins throughout at least our initial plan period of four years as essentially flat in the mid range and thats because the increase in columbia volume will continue to be costplus and then offset somewhat by the virginiaclass submarine performance and that longterm successful program as we have continued improvement ship over ship so think about flat in the near term as we go out into the future then its our job to manage that growth appropriately and as you can imagine with all – when you think about shipbuilding its all about planning thats really the competitive advantage and the key to success in shipbuilding so we have put in place very very detailed hiring plans training plans supplier base plans and facility plans to support that growth so as we sit here today im very comfortable that we are both anticipating and thinking through the potential risks of growth operator the next question comes from david strauss with ubs please go ahead david e strauss  ubs securities llc thanks good morning phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp good morning david e strauss  ubs securities llc good morning jason maybe could you touch on the eacs cume adjustments in the quarter on a yearoveryear basis given the new reporting structure and then phebe i wanted to ask you about combat systems and specifically the us business how prepared are you or your production lines stryker or abrams for a potential rampup there thanks jason w aiken  general dynamics corp so as it relates to the eac adjustments as youre probably alluding to we had been expecting with this transition to the new revenue recognition rules and specifically the cumulative catchup approach to our defense businesses to start to see a little more volatility perhaps a little bit more in terms of magnitude on this side as it turns out for the first quarter in any event the aggregate number was actually about  million and not too different from what we saw a year ago on a restated basis i think that was  million so still tbd in terms of what well see quarter to quarter over time still were probably expecting some level of volatility but for now it was a relatively inconsequential quarter phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so with respect to combat systems there has been quite a lot of discussion in this new administration about potential increases to the land forces in the united states and to the extent again to which those increases actually occur and the timing and the amounts of those increases we will look at that as the details emerge but we have plenty of capacity and plenty of operating leverage both within combat systems and within our supply base so i have very little doubt that we can ramp up to meet any expectations that our customers both the army and the marine corps may have in the future alison harbrecht  general dynamics corp next question please operator the next question comes from carter copeland with barclays please go ahead carter copeland  barclays capital inc hey good morning jason phebe phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp good morning jason w aiken  general dynamics corp good morning carter copeland  barclays capital inc at the risk jason of asking again the nerdy accounting question on the eacs just since you guys have never really had this before is that  million – or that  million is that a net favorableunfavorable number and if so can you give us the pieces and then one for phebe i just wondered you made a statement about stabilizing the ddg  at bath i just wondered if there was something beneath that what metric youre looking at in terms of stabilization that gave you the confidence to make that statement thank you jason w aiken  general dynamics corp so good question i didnt clarify that earlier both the current quarter and the yearago quarter were net favorable adjustments and in parsing that there was no material up or downs in there on any segment or any program so there were some positives and negatives as youd expect but nothing material phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so lets talk a minute and this might be a good opportunity to give you a little bit of color on bath and let me break that into two buckets first the ddg  and then to your specific question on the ddg  so we delivered the lead ship of the ddg  last may and the final two ships of this class are demonstrating very good levels of shipovership learning in terms of laborhour performance which is our prime metric that we look at when we look at shipbuilding and in fact we experienced the best shiptoship learning curve we have ever seen at bath on that program so to the extent that there was any risk i believe that is behind us with respect to the ddg  just to give you a little bit of background we delivered the ddg  which was our first ship after the fourplus year break in production we delivered that in february we just floated off the ddg  but let me give you a little color here that fouryear break caused us a bit of a challenge which the ddg  program exacerbated and i think by way of illustration a recent example can give you a sense of how weve managed through all of this before the ddg  we had late equipment deliveries into the shipyard that required us to rephase our production and it created a production gap between the ddg  and the ddg  well see some learning from ship to ship as we realize steadystate production on this but the costs associated with those challenges were recognized in  so going forward im very comfortable that the performance at bath has stabilized i like where they are carter copeland  barclays capital inc thanks phebe operator the next question comes from ron epstein with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead ronald j epstein  bank of america merrill lynch yeah hey good morning everyone phebe just maybe shifting back towards gulfstream but maybe from a different angle if northrup were to win the jstars program how do you think about the impact that could have on gulfstream across the business and specifically for the g phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp well it is our practice to refer any questions about jstars to the prime northrup but with respect to the g let me take some license with a quote that mark twain said that the reports of his demise were greatly exaggerated we have sufficient orders both on the commercial side and international orders for the g to keep that production line open for the foreseeable future so jstars would be additive to that if in fact the northrup team prevails so i very much like where we are on the g ronald j epstein  bank of america merrill lynch and then just maybe as a followon to that broadly speaking can you maybe characterize more whats going on in the widecabin market are you seeing any customer hesitation around tax reform accelerated depreciation that kind of thing or are you seeing followthrough with the pickup in the market that seemed to really happen postelection phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so in the first quarter our activity was pretty much as weve seen for the prior years but we have definitely seen frankly for about the last solid year now increased interest in our aircraft and the extent to which we execute on that interest and put all those planes into backlog thats simply a question of timing but were seeing some very nice demand for our products as we have for the last few years but i do see an uptick so whatever set of reasons different customers are motivated by a different economic reality operator the next question comes from doug harned with bernstein research please go ahead douglas stuart harned  sanford c bernstein  co llc yes thank you phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp good morning douglas stuart harned  sanford c bernstein  co llc good morning i was interested in looking at now that youre getting close to the g coming into service when you look at the ramp for that program how would you compare that to what happened on the g are you looking at a similar production increase over the next few years to the g ramp phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so if you recall the g was the first aircraft that we had a purposebuilt manufacturing facility to outfit and bring in assembly and then outfit the airplanes we experienced and had quite a bit of learning around that – around how we performed during that period so when i think about the ramp up on the g weve taken yet another purposebuilt facility applied the lessons learned on the g and i expect and our plan anticipates that well have a very nice ramp up both in terms of volume and performance relative to the g douglas stuart harned  sanford c bernstein  co llc and i know there obviously were some problems on the ramp in the g but if you look at the size of the program say and if things go smoothly and say they go smoothly for the g is this one that would look at a similar kind of a rate increase over time to the g phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp i think wed see a little bit in terms of timing and amount a little bit faster but step back and think about the g and the g when we entered into the test program we had retired an enormous amount of risk even before we had our first flight and at every step of the way on both the g and now the g we have met or surpassed our milestones and the capabilities that we had designed into that airplane so the design maturity of even the test airplane is far in excess of what we saw on the g so the disequilibrium that i think i talked about back in  where we had a bunch of gs on the tarmac that we had to go back in and retrofit we do not anticipate anything like that for the g and g simply because the test airplanes were really manufactured to production standards so well all go back and as we have had changes and updates in some design parameters weve done those at that time so i dont anticipate – in fact theres nothing to indicate that we would see anything like we did on the g does that answer your question douglas stuart harned  sanford c bernstein  co llc yes and if i can on the purposebuilt facility because a lot of what happened on the g is you made some pretty dramatic improvements in manufacturing processes i know youve done a lot of work in that regard on the g and g would you characterize the potential to improve cost of manufacturing on the g and g as a step comparable to what you did from the g and the g and should we see an improvement like that phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp given that we will start out at a higher rate perhaps the incremental improvement plane over plane may be less than what we saw on the g but i think that we are poised to have a very nice learning curve plane over plane in both programs and thats how we have – all of the analysis that we have done in terms of production preplanning suggests that will be the case operator the next question comes from howard rubel with jefferies please go ahead howard a rubel  jefferies llc thank you very much i will just use the cash flow statement to ask about four questions no to be serious for a moment thank you phebe but to be serious there are two points one to go back to dougs question a little bit we didnt see a lot of increase in inventory and so if were preparing for reasonable growth in or entry into service of the g can you explain the puts and the takes there and then second i thought at some point we would get some further advances from some of your international combat systems business and when might we expect that are there some milestones related to that and then just one small followup item could you talk about firstnet for a moment thank you jason w aiken  general dynamics corp howard ill take your first part of your question on the inventories this is one of the other many underlying subtleties of the new revenue recognition rule that we maybe skipped over at the yearend conference call as we touched on the major muscle movers but in this case we used to have a fairly – in the balance sheet categorization – ill try and be as quick as i can on this of these accounts we used to have what we called contracts in process that was almost exclusively related to the defense business and inventory that you could pretty – as a general statement pretty closely correlate to the aerospace business the new rules have us categorizing these two accounts as what we called unbilled receivables and inventories now and it now comingles some of the different pieces of the defense and commercial aerospace businesses so there were some decreases in inventories associated with the defense businesses in the quarter offsetting some of the increase that weve talked about in the gulfstream business as we built up on the g and g programs so theres a little bit of netting going on in there that youre seeing but still the story on the aerospace inventory build and the working capital is consistent with the production ramp weve talked about phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so turning to our international combat systems vehicle orders we have up until this point had milestone payments but we move in this quarter in the second quarter into payment on delivery so we anticipate that we will have a more regular order of cash on the unit of deliveries and again we are ahead of plan on our production so im comfortable that the cash flow that we modeled at the beginning of these programs we will execute on appropriately firstnet we have been careful to refer the general questions to att to whom we are a sub but we consider this a potential growth market into the future and for many years to come and again it will be a nice franchise for us howard a rubel  jefferies llc thank you very much operator the next question comes from samuel pearlstein with wells fargo please go ahead samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc good morning phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp good morning samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc i was wondering if you could talk about two different segments in terms of the guidance just ist why the revenue looked so weak this quarter and can you still get that back to up modestly for the year and i guess if you can address aerospace the same thing with the margin where it is this year would seem as though your low  is a pretty low hurdle phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so let me address in the inverse order we had a particularly outstanding quarter i think that was obvious we anticipate that well be at about a  margin in the second and third quarter and then a decline in the fourth quarter so as of today were still holding to our guidance with respect to the ist revenue let me talk about two things here remember these are two – the two businesses in that group are shortcycle businesses so we had anticipated a lighter volume quarter it was a touch lighter than we had anticipated largely because as we changed administrations we had some slowdown in the execution of the contract line items in a number of particular programs so our view today is that we are very much poised to recover that and were holding to our guidance let me talk to you a little bit about though – and i think this might be an opportune time – talk to you a little bit about how we built the guidance for this year and equally importantly in the out years when we built our plans in the fall we considered only those thenknown programs we factored them accordingly and then built into our plans the attendant cash flow to the extent across the defense portfolio that we see additional funding that represents upside to us thats true in combat in the marine group and particularly in ist so i think understanding the context in which we built these plans will help you get some sense of our confidence in our revenue estimates for the year as we stand today samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc thats helpful thank you operator the next question comes from cai von rumohr with cowen and company please go ahead cai von rumohr  cowen and company llc yes thank you very much so phebe as i thought i heard you talk about gulfstream  certification flights into october and then certification two months later are we talking about certification late in the year and is that consistent with still hitting some initial deliveries in the fourth quarter phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp this has been – theres nothing that has changed in our plan with respect to certification from the faa and i think our plan anticipated and were on track to do that one delivery well have multiple green airplanes but just right now were looking at one completed entry into service airplane on the g again consistent with what we have been anticipating cai von rumohr  cowen and company llc okay and then based on what you said about the margins at gulfstream i think on the fourth quarter call you talked about the quarterly earnings pattern given where you started the year could you maybe update us because if the margins are going to go down in the fourth quarter on paper that would seem to be a tougher compare jason w aiken  general dynamics corp one thing i think we talked about in january on the call was with – and i think we talked about it in light of the transition to the new revenue recognition rules how we were anticipating having a stronger first quarter and phebe went into this in her remarks about the green deliveries the extra green deliveries in the fourth quarter of last year and how those would translate into more outfitted deliveries in the first quarter but as we then went out of the year we had been anticipating green production as she just discussed of the gs which would now be deferred till theyre outfitted deliveries into  so while the year guidance is what it is the slope is a little bit different than perhaps typical with the stronger first quarter and a little bit of that shift in the fourth quarter because of that transition to the g so i cant reverseengineer it for you here specifically but i think that slope is what we alluded to at the end of the year and consistent with phebe just described earlier operator the next question comes from jason gursky with citi please go ahead jason gursky  citigroup global markets inc yeah good morning everyone phebe i wonder if you could spend a few minutes back on aerospace and talk a little bit about services aftermarkets at aviation just maybe describe a little bit about the current demand environment particularly on the completion side of things for jet what youre seeing in cycles and the aftermarket for the existing gulfstream fleet and then talk a little bit about the longerterm outlook for your businesses there some of the recent ma activity weve seen there and some of the other investments that youre making and what your view is on the longerterm growth outlook for aerospace services thanks phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so our aerospace services business did very well in the quarter both in terms of volume and particularly at gulfstream in terms of volume and margin and the service business is somewhat cyclical but we have continued to improve our operating performance on our service end at gulfstream with respect to jet weve got a nice pipeline of opportunities in the quarter theyre a bit of a drag on a booktobill basis in the quarter but we expect a strong second quarter on the completions side in terms of demand and the demand at jet aviation has been pretty consistent for the last couple of years its somewhat lumpy so as we – the additions into backlog of new orders have been a touch lumpy on the completions side on the services side weve been making a series of very targeted small investments to augment our fbo capability and our managed fleet capability one of the things im particularly pleased about is that weve seen additional synergies between gulfstream and jet aviation as we have matured jet and begun to provide them additional resources and assets to support gulfstream worldwide and were continuing that path so completions business steady lumpy in terms of order activity but on the service side we see nice growth in the future and were very pleased with the performance of the investments weve made heretofore operator the next question comes from myles walton with deutsche bank please go ahead myles a walton  deutsche bank securities inc thanks good morning phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp good morning myles a walton  deutsche bank securities inc i was wondering if i could circle onto gulfstream just for a second the fourth quarter margin of  is that more indicative of the completions that were carried over being better margin than the first half of  and the flowin of initial deliveries of the g and what does that tell us about  youve talked about the top line growth in  but i dont think youve said if the ebit grows in  jason w aiken  general dynamics corp so as it relates to the fourth quarter i dont know if you can state it that simply as always the quartertoquarter margin in the aerospace business is going to be the result of a number of factors weve touched on them from time to time over the years obviously mix is an important part of that you alluded to that so theres a piece of that there but its also the level of preowned activity the service business jet aviation rd all of those have meaningful points that can move you     basis points in a given quarter on each of those particular items so i wouldnt chalk it up to any one influence but thats what the mix is shaking out to be as were looking at the fourth quarter phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so when you think about margins and earnings too but lets talk about – lets go back a couple years ago when we – as we entered into this transition from the g and g to the g and g we told you all that our goal was essentially flat earnings and we were going to accomplish that by feathering in some additional g weve done that but on top of which weve had superior cost control and nice operating leverage at gulfstream so thats combined to allow us to meet that commitment as we go into next year we are anticipating – we havent given you specific yearoveryear guidance on margins but were going to bring down that g production a touch as you would expect as we move up the ramp on the g and then ultimately the g so when you look at – the past has to be prologue when you look at the operating performance of gulfstream i am very comfortable that theyll do nicely on their margin performance but were not going to get into  details until we get a little bit further in fact well do it at the end of the year as is our constant practice myles a walton  deutsche bank securities inc okay all right thanks operator the next question comes from rob stallard with vertical research please go ahead robert stallard  vertical research partners llc thanks so much good morning phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp good morning robert stallard  vertical research partners llc phebe i was wondering if you could comment on this whole continuing resolution situation whether youve seen any impact of that particularly on your shortcycle businesses and what your expectations are if this should drag on phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp the congress – the customer has made it quite clear to the congress on the impacts on national security of failing to enact a budget that said weve done an analysis of a potential fullyear cr which we do not anticipate but if we actually experience a fullyear cr the impact on our  is not material so that tells you something about the strength of our backlog by the way robert stallard  vertical research partners llc so theres been no impact in ist that youve seen so far phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp no not yet other than its a little slow to execute on some of the contract task orders but we anticipate that increasing robert stallard  vertical research partners llc thats great thank you very much alison harbrecht  general dynamics corp gary i think we have time for one more question operator and the final question will come from seth seifman with jpmorgan please go ahead seth m seifman  jpmorgan securities llc thanks very much good morning phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp good morning seth m seifman  jpmorgan securities llc phebe i wonder if you could talk a little bit about the ma landscape these days and whether anticipation of a growing defense budget causes you to look at anything differently or whether high valuations remain a deterrent phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp so i have an answer that ive been giving for the last four years now under the fifth and its were not going to comment on ma its simply not appropriate you all understand the landscape and we havent seen much changes in valuations so no real change seth m seifman  jpmorgan securities llc okay fair enough and maybe ill sneak in another quick one then and maybe as you talk about – thinking about the business jet market and where you think about the opportunities longer term i guess as you think about investing in new platforms not necessarily a specific plan but whether youd think about smaller or large and also your future plans for the g phebe n novakovic  general dynamics corp lets answer this in this regard because any more specificity is inappropriate you can expect that we will continue to have a robust rd profile to fund new product development now and into the future thats our business proposition and in that regard were going to stick to our knitting were going to stick to our market in which we have excelled and frankly were the only company to fully excel so steady as she goes past is prologue seth m seifman  jpmorgan securities llc great thank you very much alison harbrecht  general dynamics corp great thank you for joining our call today if you have additional questions i
