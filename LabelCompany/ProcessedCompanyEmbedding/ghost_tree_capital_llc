capital is a healthcareoriented hedge fund headquartered in new york it was founded in  by david kim who is the portfolio manager ken greenberg and brian kim senior analysts and matt diaz trader ghost tree capital team formerly worked at richard schimel‘s diamondback capital david kim also worked as a portfolio manager at ken griffin‘s citadel investment group with almost  of its equity portfolio valued at approximately  million allocated to the healthcare industry “the firm’s strategy is focused on driving strong absolute returns independent of market cycles based on fundamental primary research and disciplined financial analysis” ghost tree many hedge funds have been filing their fs for the fourth quarter of  lately in these forms they disclose most of their long equity positions as of the end of december although the portfolio information is a few weeks old there are still a few ways for investors to use it in this article we will briefly look into the equity portfolio of ken greenberg and david kim’s ghost tree capital by the end of the fourth quarter this was the first time that the fund reported its equity portfolio at the us securities and exchange commission although its most valuable holdings are mostly comprised by call and put options at several companies –including allergan inc nyseagn and gilead sciences inc nasdaqgild we will focus on its long stock positions the fund has placed its largest bet on gilead sciences inc nasdaqgild a  billion market cap researchbased biopharmaceutical company that discovers develops and commercializes new medicines for different medical sectors kim and greenberg’s fund owned  shares of the company by dec st  valued at roughly  million –which comprises about  of its equity portfolio including ‘put’ and ‘call’ options the percentage of its portfolio invested in gilead raises to roughly  this investment certainly makes sense especially given the company’s industry leading margins and returns low debt levels and amazing growth prospects analysts expect it to deliver average annual eps growth rates around  over the next five years with a privileged position in the hiv and hepatitis c markets this stock looks like a safe bet in addition it trades at a substantial discount in relation to its peers at  times the company’s earnings versus an industry average valuation of x pe moreover the stock is already up more than  since their purchases even further several other major hedge funds including julian robertson’s tiger management which holds  shares up by  over q and lee munder’s lee munder capital group also seem to feel quite bullish on this company ghost tree’s second largest long position is in bristolmyers squibb co nysebmy a biopharmaceutical company with a market cap of  billion the fund owns  shares of the company valued at  million comprising  of its portfolio this holding is the fund’s seventh most valuable one despite ghost tree’s bullishness opinion among funds and analysts is quite divided in relation to bristolmyers squibb co nysebmy some feel encouraged by decent growth projections a strong portfolio of drugs a robust pipeline a wide economic moat –mainly supported by its patent holdings and pipeline and a  dividend yield amongst them we can find christopher medlock’s partner fund management which holds  million shares and alex denner’s sarissa capital management others instead would rather hold on this stock mainly in account of the company’s below average margins and returns valuation at x pe double its industry´s average high debt levels and important patent losses that will continue through  in this group of bears i would like to highlight jim simons who sold out  of his stakes in the company during the fourth quarter amongst several  others who closed out or significantly reduced their positions the fund’s top  list is completed by biogen idec inc nasdaqbiib and the spectranetics corporation nasdaqspnc two healthcare tech companies each of these holdings are worth more than  million and comprise combined about  of ghost tree’s portfolio no doubt about it ken greenberg and david kim’s bets are placed on the healthcare
