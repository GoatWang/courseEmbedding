uncertain poetries paperback pp xins  download a pdf sampler from this book here these essays concern the uncertain nature of twentiethcentury poetry dealing with such major figures as pound stevens moore oppen duncan niedecker lorca rilke and mallarmé and of poets in more contemporary modernist and postmodernist lineages they examine how these poets articulate virtually in the same breath both affirmation and doubt concerning poetry history and knowledge   for decades michael heller has been making in his poetry one of the most careful explorations we have of the lyric imagination for nearly as long readers have relied on convictions net of branches as their gateway into understanding the objectivists in  heller offered us living root one of the great spiritual autobiographies in the american poetic idiom what a pleasure to have these essays then collected in uncertain poetries as an affirmation of the depth and seriousness of hellers engagement with lyric properties and as a testament to the vibrancy of his thought and to the admirable intensity of his questioning mind —peter oleary michael heller is not only one of our finest poets he is also one of our best thinkers and prose writers someone for whom thought is aesthetic in this volume poetry is the object of exquisite meditations that show it to be alive delicate — and yet the most powerful force in human affairs written under the aegis of an uncertainty that embodies the condition of modernity hellers prose is at once supremely intelligent and knowing deeply philosophical and ruminative and utterly graceful what other poet or scholar could be more illuminating hellers contribution to our understanding of the poetic act language more broadly civilization is truly extraordinary it will remain with us for a very long time —burt kimmelman michael heller believes with louis zukofsky that poetry offers ‘precise information on existence uncertain poetries proves the point coupling generosity of attention with precisions that are as vital as they are unassuming —peter nicholls   order from amazoncouk order from the book depository order from amazoncom order from barnes and noblecom usa order from small
