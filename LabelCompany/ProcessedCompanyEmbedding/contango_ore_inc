contango ore all rights reserved contango ore mining gold and associated minerals in alaska contango ore gold associated minerals and rare earth elements in alaska tetlin project rights plan press releases presentations our team investor relations corporate governance contact us   contango ore in the news company strategy and focus contango ore inc core has a strategy of exploring for gold copper silver and other valuable minerals in alaska and advancing our discoveries to the point that our properties become attractive to a larger integrated mining company for acquisition or joint venture our belief is that while grass roots exploration expenditures are inherently risky the potential returns for our shareholders is maximized during the exploration phase by successfully discovering new resources of gold and other valuable minerals and monetizing the assets once they are defined to a sufficient degree to sell them to a mining company better equipped to move them from exploration to production cores current focus is on the tetlin goldcoppersilver project in the eastern interior of alaska near tok the majority of our acre land position is a longterm lease from the tetlin village council and we added state of alaska mining claims adjoining the tetlin village lands geologically these lands are located in the prolific tintina gold belt and also fall within a recently defined ns trending porphyry copper trend although the most costeffective months to explore are june through september excellent access and infrastructure in the tetlin project area allow for exploration on a yeararound basis producing gold mines in these trends include fort knox  ouncesyear and pogo  ouncesyear with many other known gold occurrences that are not yet in production the lands are also very accessible with the alaska highway running through the northern portion of our leasehold and the tok cutoff highway is only  to  miles west of our drilling activity we began exploring these leases in  and after spending most of our initial efforts gathering reconnaissance stream sediment and pan concentrate samples collecting top of bedrock soil auger samples collecting surface grab and trench samples completing airborne resistivitymagnetic surveys and completing limited drilling in  we were successful in making a significant goldcoppersilver discovery in  we originally named the area with our best results from surface data the chief danny prospect area and while drilling in this area we discovered a unique zone with gold grades much higher than anything on trend that we can document and we named this discovery the peak zone after our chairman ken peak peak zone detail targeting a lowlevel goldcopper soil anomaly the peak zone was discovered in the summer of  following discovery in the first hole about  meters of drilling was completed with  of  holes in the zone returning gold grade of greater than  gpt over more than  meters our best drill intercepts grades are  gpt over  meters beyond the obvious significance of the gold grades discovered over an interval up to  meters thick hole  the peak zone is clearly seen as a magnetic highresistivity low associated with sulfide host rock on our airborne magneticresistivity data our observation is that all of the meaningful gold grades in this part of our project are associated with sulfide host rock but not all sulfide host rock contains material gold grades as you can see on the anomaly map we have identified other prospects with similar signatures that have not yet been drilled some with supporting surface geochemistry gold anomalies while the peak zone as we currently know it is not big enough to be considered economically viable in our view if our planned  drilling campaigns are successful in expanding the peak zone and can identify additional resources on one or more of the prospects we have identified core will have reached a stage where one or more areas of the tetlin project have become economically attractive our  drilling program will include further delineation and expansion of the peak zone with a goal to define the total productive area of the discovery along with the testing of the other prospects referenced above we plan to have  to  drill rigs running all summer and we also plan to acquire additional airborne magneticresistivity data to cover prospective lands that we have not yet explored we interpret our discovery to be unique in this trend both in the high quality of the gold grades and the geologic character of the goldcoppersilver our hope is that we are able to use our airborne geophysical data along with our surface geochemistry data to locate several independent but related deposits in close proximity that will create an economic resource combined with the projects stable land status excellent infrastructure and impressive geologic pedigree the tetlin project is emerging as one of the most prospective
