successfully emailed the post × linkedin ceo these five things make a worldclass tech product jonathan fisher mar    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print stephen lamgetty images linkedin ceo jeff weiner believes that great products can be separated from notsogreat products through five key principles taking the stage at the launch conference in san francisco today he gave the audience of startup entrepreneurs and investors five characteristics that make up a worldclass tech product and gave an example for each one  great products deliver a singular value proposition weiner highlighted google as a perfect example of this before they erupted onto the scene altavista was the most prominent search engine at the time however because google just focused on their logo and a search box they eventually changed the world with their search engine  earlier in the talk he used yahoo as an example of what not to do he said that each time they went into another vertical they encountered competition  they anticipate a customers needs weiner said that waze is a perfect example of a product that knows what its customer wants and delivers on it he told the audience that one day as he was about to leave work he turned on waze and was about to type in his home address when a message popped up asking whether he was going home  combining driving directions and mapping  intelligence waze had figured out the general time he usually headed home using this information to anticipate his daily commute time  this he said sends the signal that the product understands me  they exceed expectations weiner told the audience that one night he and his wife were hosting a party he was in charge of music for the night but because his wifi had just been reconfigured his sonos music system was not working he called their customer service line and was told that because it was a holiday the offices were closing in  minutes in the end weiner said that the customer service exceeded expectations  the guy stayed an hour after close to help me set up music it helps to not only have a great product but reliable and dedicated customer service as well  they resonate emotionally according to weiner a perfect example of a product that resonates emotionally is a tesla — its like driving an iphone he said he constantly mentioned how using the product felt like driving the future a catchphrase that tesla has never once marketed he mentioned how others have said the exact same thing about driving teslas which really hammered home the point that the best products make you feel without directly prompting you  have a meaningful impact on your life weiner mentioned that his iphone has become the control panel of his life the best products are the ones that are so helpful they manage to change your routines and serve as an extension of yourself now watch heres the youtube star taking over the internet  seconds at a time more linkedin jeff weiner

jul    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print linkedin ceo jeff weiner michael loccisanogetty since becoming ceo in  jeff weiner has led linkedin to become a network of  million registered users with offices in  countries and a market cap of  billion weiners leadership style has earned him the trust of founder and chairman reid hoffman his team and linkedin investors glassdoor named him the highestrated ceo of  earlier this year weiner spoke at the wisdom  conference in san francisco where he explained how he understands his role as a leader firstly he sees the role of a manager as someone who tells others what to do whereas a leader inspires others to do great things he broke down three functions of an inspirational leader they are clear about their companys vision weiner said linkedin employees know the company strives to enhance the productivity and economic opportunity of everyone in the world pushing them to constantly reach more people fred kofman linkedins vp of leadership and organizational development was also on the panel and said he has a visual metaphor for how he sees weiner most ceos sit at the front of a boat and tell their employees where they need to row weiner grabs a surfboard and catches a huge wave inspiring everyone behind him to do the same the surfers are all riding the same wave sharing the same vision but are putting much more of their heart and personality into their work than the grunts in the rowboat they are brave weiner said its necessary to have courage because if you have true vision and you want to try something that hasnt been done before theres gonna be a lot of naysayers theres gonna be a lot of skeptics theres gonna be a lot of people who feel threatened and try to get in your way you have to feel it deeply to be able to overcome those challenges and for people to want to follow you and if youre not authentic in that belief and you dont have true conviction theyre not gonna be behind you he said they are effective communicators weiner told business insider ceo henry blodget last year that the role of chief executive requires a constant awareness of how you are communicating your vision and conviction to the rest of the company the more people youre responsible for the more your words and the way you communicate those words and your body language and essentially everything you do is taken into consideration by the team he said you have to be that much more aware of the way in which youre coming across and i think the best leaders maintain awareness of their environment and in real time can course correct it doesnt matter if theyre in a oneonone a staff meeting an allhands or speaking to thousands of people at a keynote they are always aware of the way they are being received they can course correct so they can ensure that what theyre saying is resonating and that its bringing people together at the wisdom  conference weiner said that if as a leader you are able to incorporate these three aspects into your role then the job just becomes a matter of what objective youre trying to achieve and then surrounding yourself with the best talent you can see also linkedin ceo jeff

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
