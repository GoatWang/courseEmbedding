kannappan discusses how he discovered the key to motivating employees while working at his first job by ilan mochari ilan mocharis debut novel zinsky the obscure fomite press  earned rave reviews from publishers weekly kirkus reviews and booklist bostons npr station named it one of  good reads for the summer he is a senior writer for inc magazine ilanmochari senior writer incilanmochari write a comment credit ceos notebook s kenneth kannappan  present life ceo of plantronics a million maker of telephone headsets based in santa cruz calif former life in the summer of  after he graduated from high school kannappan worked for an electronicsrepair shop in northbrook ill it was  an hour there was very poor ventilation but at the time jobs were not plentiful lining up summer work was difficult he says lessons learned it was more of an example of how not to manage kannappan says for example when repairing something we all took supplies from the same supply bin and when we were done repairing we all put our finished products in the same finished bin so there was no individual accountability for using supplies or performing quickly people in general were not motivated to work to the maximum level that they could kannappan attributes that lack of motivation to managements failure to communicate there was no explanation of the companys goals and how everyones efforts fit in the job was simply about obtaining income employees never came to management with suggestions on how processes could improve and management didnt ask the way i believe you motivate people is to make it clear not only what goals the company is trying to achieve but also why the goals are important to society our products for example help people drive safely while talking on mobile phones thats a societal benefit we want our people to under stand he says kannappan constantly canvasses his workforce of  for suggestions feedback from employeesatisfaction surveys led to changes in his companys visioncare policy retirement plan and training budget the company also conducts monthly townhall meetings at its  offices and holds a summertime management conference at one such conference we talked about the best and worst managers wed ever had says the ceo the worst ones generally were the ones who monitor all the time the better ones just communicate to employees a clear and exciting goal point the way
