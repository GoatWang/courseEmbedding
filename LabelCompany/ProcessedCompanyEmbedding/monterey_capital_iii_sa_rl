for immediate release recommended cash acquisition of infinis energy plc infinis by monterey capital ii sà rl monterey a terra firma group company to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under part  of the companies act  summary ·           the board of directors of monterey and the infinis independent directors are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition by which the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of infinis that monterey does not already own will be acquired by monterey ·           monterey currently owns  infinis ordinary shares representing approximately  per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of infinis ·           under the terms of the acquisition each scheme shareholder will receive  pence in cash for each infinis ordinary share which represents a premium of approximately  per cent to the closing price of  pence per infinis ordinary share on  october  being the last business day before this announcement and  per cent to the average closing price of  pence per infinis ordinary share for the onemonth period ended  october  being the last business day before this announcement ·           the acquisition values infinis entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital at approximately £ million ·           it is intended that the acquisition will be implemented by means of a courtsanctioned scheme of arrangement under part  of the companies act ·           the infinis independent directors who have been so advised by barclays bank plc acting through its investment bank barclays and rbc capital markets as to the financial terms of the acquisition consider the terms of the acquisition to be fair and reasonable in providing their advice barclays and rbc capital markets have taken into account the commercial assessments of the infinis independent directors rbc capital markets is providing independent financial advice to the infinis independent directors for the purposes of rule  of the code ·           accordingly the infinis independent directors have unanimously approved the acquisition and intend to recommend that infinis shareholders vote in favour of the scheme at the court meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the general meeting as they have irrevocably undertaken to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings of in aggregate  infinis ordinary shares representing approximately  per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of infinis on  october  being the last business day prior to the date of this announcement further details of these irrevocable undertakings including the circumstances in which they cease to be binding are set out in appendix  to the following announcement ·           it is expected that the court meeting and general meeting will be held by the end of november  subject amongst other things to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions it is expected that the scheme will become effective by the end of this year ·           infinis is the leading independent renewable power generator in the uk and operates  power plants with an installed capacity of  mw generating renewable power from landfill gas and onshore wind it also has four onshore wind projects under construction which are expected to deliver  mw of incremental onshore wind capacity by  march  the

information on the background to and reasons for the independent directors recommendation and paragraph  of the following announcement provides further information on the background to and reasons for the acquisition ·           commenting on todays announcement guy hands chairman and chief investment officer of terra firma said the transaction announced today is part of terra firmas strategy of monetising its investment in infinis a business that we have owned and invested in over more than a decade we have considered gradual selldowns of our interest in the company since its ipo in november  and more recently we have also explored other strategic options but the change in the regulatory environment for infinis has prompted us to rethink our strategy we believe that this transaction offers infinis shareholders an attractive cash consideration for their shares in infinis and allows terra firma to pursue alternative options to monetise its investment in infinis once it is a private company we are pleased that the infinis independent directors have unanimously recommended the transaction and are grateful to the infinis board and management team for their support in particular as we have jointly completed the preparations for the offer announced today ·           commenting on todays announcement ian marchant chairman of infinis said since the ipo of infinis two years ago our management and employees have delivered what was promised in terms of both operational performance and the development of the business with  mw of new wind capacity in construction however the challenging regulatory and political environment and the reduction in power prices in the last two years have adversely affected both the cash generation and the growth prospects of the business accordingly the infinis independent directors have been actively exploring ways to maximise value and have looked at offers for the whole business as well as selling the assets separately following this work the infinis independent directors firmly believe that the offer from monterey represents the best combination of risk and return for shareholders ·           the scheme document containing further information about the acquisition and notices of the court meeting and general meeting together with the forms of proxy will be posted to infinis shareholders and for information only to participants in the infinis share schemes as soon as practicable and in any event within  days of the date of this announcement unless the panel agrees otherwise this summary should be read in

capital ii sà rl monterey a terra firma group company to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under part  of the companies act       introduction the board of directors of monterey and the infinis independent directors are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition by which the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of infinis that monterey does not already own will be acquired by monterey it is intended that the acquisition will be implemented by way of a courtsanctioned scheme of arrangement under part  of the companies act monterey currently owns  infinis ordinary shares representing approximately  per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of infinis      the acquisition under the terms of the acquisition which will be subject to the conditions and further terms set out in appendix  to this announcement and to be set out in the scheme document scheme shareholders at the scheme record time will be entitled to receive for each scheme share  pence in cash the price of  pence in cash for each scheme share represents a premium of approximately ·            per cent to the closing price of  pence per infinis ordinary share on  october  being the last business day before this announcement and ·            per cent to the average closing price of  pence per infinis ordinary share for the onemonth period ended  october  being the last business day before this announcement the acquisition values infinis entire issued and to be issued share capital at approximately £ million monterey reserves the right to reduce the price of the acquisition by the amount of any dividend which is declared paid or payable by infinis after the date of this announcement it is expected that the court meeting and general meeting will be held by the end of november  subject amongst other things to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions it is expected that the scheme will become effective by the end of this year      background to and reasons for the acquisition since the original investment in infinis former parent company in  terra firma established and developed infinis business through a combination of organic and acquisitive growth  in november  with infinis well established as one of the uks leading renewable power generators terra firma sold a circa  per cent stake in infinis through an initial public offering on the main market of the london stock exchange with gradual selldowns of the remaining stake envisaged over time since the initial public offering infinis has performed well at an operational level has delivered on its dividend commitments and is in the process of constructing four onshore wind farms from its organic pipeline of projects under development by december  it had become clear to terra firma that a managed selldown of its investment in infinis through secondary offerings over time was unlikely to materialise at an acceptable price  terra firma therefore announced on  december  that it was exploring options in relation to its remaining approximately  per cent shareholding in infinis this process has subsequently suffered from the political implications of the general election in the uk most clearly manifested in the proposed removal of the support for new onshore wind capacity and the removal of the exemption from the climate change levy for electricity generated from renewable sources announced by the new government in july  compounded by a challenging power price environment following constructive discussions with the infinis independent directors and management terra firma and monterey have decided that monterey will make an offer for the infinis shares that monterey does not own with a view to taking infinis private  this would facilitate terra firmas pursuit of strategic alternatives for infinis that are consistent with its objective of monetising its investment in infinis terra firma believes that it will be easier for infinis to implement these strategic alternatives as a private company through its review of strategic options in relation to its investment in infinis terra firma has carefully considered a number of options for crystallising value from this investment having taken into consideration a number of factors including the changing political environment for renewable energy in the uk terra firma currently believes that separate sales of the onshore wind portfolio in whole or in part and the landfill gas assets are the optimal path for terra firma to achieve an exit from its investment in infinis to this end terra firma and infinis intend to work together to prepare for and in due course take initial steps in relation to the sale of infinis onshore wind assets with any such sales taking place following the implementation of the acquisition a review of options around monetisation of the landfill gas portfolio is also expected to follow      recommendation the infinis independent directors who have been so advised by barclays and rbc capital markets as to the financial terms of the acquisition consider the acquisition to be fair and reasonable in providing their advice barclays and rbc capital markets have taken into account the commercial assessments of the infinis independent directors rbc capital markets is providing independent financial advice to the infinis independent directors for the purposes of rule  of the code accordingly the infinis independent directors have unanimously approved the acquisition and intend to recommend that infinis shareholders vote in favour of the scheme at the court meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the general meeting as they have irrevocably undertaken to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings of in aggregate  infinis ordinary shares representing approximately  per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of infinis on  october  being the last business day prior to the date of this announcement mike kinski who is both a nonexecutive director of infinis and a representative of terra firma has played no part in the consideration of the acquisition or the recommendation of it by the infinis independent directors      background to and reasons for the recommendation the infinis independent directors have worked constructively with terra firma since its announcement on  december  stating that terra firma was exploring options to crystallise the value of its  per cent shareholding in infinis including a potential sale of the stake to ensure that the interests of all shareholders have been properly considered infinis management team has remained focussed on operational delivery throughout this period of uncertainty regarding the ultimate ownership of infinis and in the face of significant political regulatory and fiscal challenges in the renewable energy sector in the uk  infinis has continued to deliver reliable power from its existing landfill gas and wind portfolio and has made significant progress in the development of  mw of wind capacity including bringing north steads and sisters to financial close  however the changes in the uk renewable energy regulatory framework and the prevailing power price environment have impacted infinis near term cash generation and the organic and inorganic growth prospects of infinis infinis has announced that the removal of the exemption from the ccl previously enjoyed by renewable energy generation would result in an anticipated reduction of infinis ebitda of approximately £ million in the year ending  march  and approximately £ million in the year ending  march   consequently and as indicated at the q trading statement on  august  infinis would need to review its dividend policy in the absence of the acquisition in reaching their conclusion the infinis independent directors considered the acquisition in the context of the value prospects and cash generation profile of the underlying business segments of infinis against other proposals received and against the value to all shareholders were the board to pursue alternative strategies including a breakup of infinis as a publicly listed company through a sale of its wind business  the infinis independent directors have taken into account the significant execution risk uncertainty surrounding the landfill gas business as a standalone investment proposition and the uncertain timescale for delivery of such a breakup strategy  in addition since  infinis has received other proposals but none that have been as attractive to independent shareholders as the acquisition  accordingly the infinis independent directors believe the acquisition offers the independent shareholders in the circumstances an acceptable value an exit from infinis at an uncertain time for infinis and the renewable sector more generally and an opportunity to crystallise a premium to the current market price in cash the infinis independent directors have unanimously decided to recommend that infinis independent shareholders vote in favour of the acquisition the infinis independent directors recognise that there will be a period of transition for infinis and the infinis employees but believe that in the circumstances the acquisition is in the best interests of infinis in the medium term      irrevocable undertakings all of the infinis independent directors who hold infinis ordinary shares have irrevocably undertaken to vote in favour of the scheme at the court meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the general meeting in respect of in aggregate  infinis ordinary shares representing approximately  per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of infinis on
