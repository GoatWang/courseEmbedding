morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns

to provide capital appreciation consistent with the riskreturn characteristics of a diversified portfolio of hedge funds the secondary goal is to achieve these returns with less volatility than major equity indices strategy the fund seeks to achieve long and short exposure to global equity bond currency and commodity markets through a wide range of derivative instruments and direct investments the advisor expects that it will invest at least  of the funds total assets in money market and other shortterm highquality securities risk the fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect such as derivatives and forwardsettling securities which may increase market exposure magnify investment risks and cause losses to be realized more quickly the fund may invest in commoditylinked investments which may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying instruments or measures in addition their value may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as by weather disease and regulatory developments the commodities industry can be significantly affected by commodity prices world events import controls worldwide competition government regulations and economic conditions the risk of loss in trading foreign currency can be substantial and may be magnified if trading on margin customers should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for them in light of their financial condition risk tolerance and understanding of foreign markets these risks include foreign currency risk and liquidation risk stock markets especially foreign markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer political regulatory market or economic developments foreign securities are subject to interest rate currency exchange rate economic and political risks short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a securitys price increases therefore the loss on a short sale is theoretically

class y      barclay fund of funds      multialternative      as of  risk low avg high above average this fund scores above average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment decisionlearn more fund risk and return as
