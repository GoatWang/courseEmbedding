exosomes underlying several forms of cancer upwards of  of all cancerrelated deaths are attributed to metastasis the spread of cancer from a primary site of origin to other organs or areas of the body the mechanism of how tumors metastasize to distant sites in the body has long been one of cancers greatest mysteries that mystery was recently solved when circulating particles known as tumorderived exosomes were discovered to be the seeds that promote the spread and growth of cancer metastasis   aethlon initiated its tumorderived exosome research at a time when the medical community believed exosomes were merely cellular debris with no biological function today a therapeutic to address tumorderived exosomes represents a significant unmet need in cancer care aethlon has demonstrated that the affinity mechanism of the hemopurifier® can capture tumorderived exosomes underlying several forms of cancer including breast ovarian and metastatic melanoma our extended tumorderived exosome research beyond their role in metastasis researchers have also published mounting evidence that tumorderived exosomes contribute to tumorigenesis the formation of cancer cancer progression angiogenesis creation of blood vessels to fuel tumor growth immune evasion and resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs recent discoveries also reveal that exosomes may contribute to bacterial and viral pathogenesis the progression of alzheimer and parkinson’s diseases the spread of prion proteins and numerous inflammatory conditions  view press releases view whitepaper aethlon
