the year  the retail shopping experience is expected to look dramatically different than it does todayit’s being reshaped say fintech pioneers and futurists by the accelerated pace of new technology and changing consumer shopping patterns they urge retailers to begin planning for that future now the following list of forwardlooking trends is a good place to start diy retail the evolution of selfservicetechnology will bring on a new era of diy shopping—changing how we select and access products and the ways we pay selfservice will make shopping faster easier and funretail insights the interactionless retail model  will become more mainstream no need to interact with a sales associate with sensors on all items shoppers can pay with phone or fingerprint and then leave the traditional checkout process will change sales associates will only be there for their expertise if no expertise is required there’s no need for an associate interactive mirrors in dressing room shoppers touch the mirror screen for product info to request another size from associate or to order and buy from dressing room  stores—no more rules in retail after hours stores have a drivethru window robot assisted order on ipad at window robot goes and gets item and delivers it“time and conveniencetechnology is really the driver that accelerates that for the consumer”—whit goodrich cmo retail card synchrony financial automation nation using smart data to deliver customizationas customers willingly provide more personal information they’ll demand that retailers use that information to deliver better customized products and offers this give and take will drive customer loyalty in a new world where oldschool rules about loyalty will be thrown out the windowretail insights retailers will know shoppers well from rfid in cell phones or biometrics like fingerprint scanners when they enter the store retailers will be able to serve up customized products and experiences they can direct you to items you like and send unique popup sales offers determined by your profile to your phoneinhome chatbot devices will become mainstream and more proactive—offering advice on the best brands to shop for and the latest offers  thirdparty unbiased experts in the form of “digital assistants” will be popular shoppers can get honest opinions rather than rely on biased retail associate opinions—essentially an expert network on an app curated to shoppers’ needs smart connected car and home are nonretail examples of this technology“what we really need when we’re out shopping in the physical world is to selfidentify who we are so that we can associate ourselves with a purchase you can do that without the use of a mobile device or any device because we have our own unique physical identity that can be captured by various biometrics making us the device”——wendy mackinnon keith founder digital retail apps “i think consumers are going to be much more sophisticated and when you get these digital natives or these borndigital generations they’re going to look at information for what it is an asset they’ve created that can be monetized”——ryan matthews futurist black monk consulting  brick and mortar’s reason for being entertainment and engagementbrick and mortar stores will exist in the future but there will be fewer of them a new model of delivering not only products but also genuine brand experiences is emerging people are social by nature and will be drawn to gathering places to share ideas and be entertained it’s not just about making money it’s about building trust retailers who tap into this trend will be rewardedretail insights show me example an instore d printer print customized products on the spot it’s not only convenient but also engages the customer—who now takes away both the product and knowledge  entertain me example merge experiences bring other categories to the retail experience put a coffee shop café music experience bar or complimentary products or services inside the store it’s a big reason why local “markets” are making a resurgence across america teach me example a craft learning experience let shoppers see how a product like a leather belt is made from scratch while the artisan experience is already being used it will become more mainstream in the future  help me example a retailer app pick out clothes and reserve a dressing room from the retailer’s app it’s both a timesaver and a delighter “people get overwhelmed  of customers who don’t see an item they like will not ask for help service will be important and there will be a need to empower associates with tools that make the experience exceptional” ——healey cypher cofounder oak labs inc“so the question then is if you don’t need to go to a place to get stuff what do you need to go to a place for and that’s kind of what we call higherengagement things the experience advice consultation fun it’s moved beyond transactions into real relationships”  ——ryan mathewsfuturist black monk consulting  less is more streamlining of brandsin highinvolvement categories specialty retailers will remain a goto but variety will be important with that said shoppers are reaching a tipping point around american consumption feelings of angst about acquiring too much “stuff” is driving a shift toward purchasing experiences rather than things along with concern for the environment consumers feel that retail must streamline and consolidate in the future retail insightsbrands in the future must have a strong “reason for being”purchasing everyday commodities through online retailers and automated reordering will reduce the need to visit traditional onestop shop retailers   “there is a countertrend around wanting to feel included wanting to feel part of a community the social piece is what we believe is fundamentally going to change the experience”——kristen johnsonfuturist lowe’s home improvement“retail will be about making the tedious stuff invisible and the fun stuff beautiful and immersive”——healey cypher cofounder oak labs inc retail on demand we want it now the evolution of technology is creating a more demanding shopper base—one that expects what they purchase to be instantly available retail insightsstores on wheels will come to you the selection will be smaller but shoppers can order on the spot and their purchase will be shipped to their house the same day from a local warehouse trunk stores popup shops and subscription services will become more mainstream shoppers will see a consolidation of the number of brands in this spacereturns will be a snap purchaser hits the “return” button on the retailer’s app and and either a driverless car or a drone will appear within an hour to pick up your return no need for repackaging either“ship to store” option is gaining traction but the process needs improvement often the purchaser shows up at the store and the order is not thereproof of inventory not all retailers update their inventory in real time causing shoppers to make a wasted trip to the store in the future shoppers will see a picture of the item on the shelf before getting in their cars“driverless cars will be here long before package delivery by drone once you have driverless cars and you have the sharing economy to be able to use the space in those cars to make various kinds of deliveries i think that’s going to end up being more commonplace than package delivery by drone”——wendy mackinnon keithfounder digital retail apps“the biggest disrupter in retail in the future could be d printing—footprints to create shoes create things in a quick cheap manner we never could before it’s mass customization”——courtney gentlemancmo payment solutions synchrony financial“in the future shoppers will take a picture of the room and add things to it whether it’s furniture or accessories change the color of the walls etc from a technology and consumer standpoint we’ll see that retailers might leverage augmented reality for example to help achieve this”——john williamssvp marketing innovation synchrony financial  retail comes to you bridging the gap between home and storeretail insights virtual reality and beyond shoppers will have access to an interface that allows them to see what a new sofa paint garage door kitchen floor and so on would look like in their
