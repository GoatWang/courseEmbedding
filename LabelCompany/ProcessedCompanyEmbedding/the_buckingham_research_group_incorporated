continues to scale said michael marrano cto for the buckingham research group incorporated our employees wanted to use their ipads to access all of our corporate applications desktopdirect was in production in a matter of weeks without desktopdirect i was looking at a very expensive project spanning several months with desktopdirect i was able to enable full ipad access that was fully secure at a fraction of the cost of alternative solutionstablets are simple light and portable and are becoming increasingly affordable as a result many more employees are bringing their personal tablets to worka trend referred to as bring your own device byod as a consequence it management is presented with the challenges of maintaining corporate security and providing invisible seamless access to applications while supporting the broad range of tablet devices on the market using an encrypted ssl connection desktopdirect provides secure access from tablets such as ipads to a users office pc via a low bandwidth connection that maintains corporate security protocols and prevents data leakage the desktopdirect mobile application opens a secure window to office desktops that allows only for control of secure remote environments  with business and personal data never mixing and because the desktopdirect mobile app can be downloaded to and launched from any ios or android device it can avoid providing support for specific mobile devices with desktopdirect it maintains full control of corporate data while employees can choose the best device to fit their personal requirementsthe buckingham research group incorporated is a perfect example of the benefits provided by desktopdirect said lior rapaport director of product management for array networks like many industries financial services is heavily dependent on maintaining compliance and ensuring that confidential data does not leak outside the corporate network desktopdirect provides a solution that eliminates the possibility of data leakage and simultaneously enables remote access for any employee looking to access corporate applications using an apple ipad android tablet or remote pc desktopdirect is available now directly from array networks and through authorized array total value partners the desktopdirect mobile app is now available in the apple app store and the android marketplace   « return
