published for purposes of rule  opinion aronson j petitioner cottonwood capital property management ii llc cottonwood petitions for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to grant cottonwoods motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction real parties in interest nnn century hills tic  llc through nnn century hills tic  llc collectively owners are  limited liability companies that contracted with daymark realty properties inc daymark to manage an apartment complex owners bought in georgia a few years later daymark entered into a subcontract with cottonwood to have it manage the apartments for daymark owners filed this action against cottonwood and daymark after owners lender foreclosed on the apartments because cottonwood stopped making payments on owners purchase money loan according to cottonwood it stopped making loan payments because the apartments did not generate sufficient revenue to pay the operating expenses and service owners loan and owners refused to comply with cottonwoods capital call seeking additional funds to cover the expenses and loan payments owners alleged claims for breach of the subcontract breach of the original property management agreement and various torts cottonwood moved to quash service arguing it had not purposefully availed itself of any california benefits by entering into and performing the subcontract and therefore it lacked sufficient minimum contacts with california to constitutionally allow the states courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over it we agree and grant the petition cottonwood is a utah limited liability company with its principal place of business in utah it has no offices employees agents or assets in california and conducts no business in the state daymark and cottonwood negotiated and executed the subcontract in utah and cottonwood had no direct contractual relationship with owners cottonwood performed the subcontract in georgia where the apartments were located and in utah where its offices were located cottonwood did not engage in any activities in california relative to the subcontract cottonwoods california connections were limited to sending budgets plans reports miscellaneous communications and the capital call to a subset of owners that had members living in california these same connections also existed with the  other states where owners members lived cottonwood did not seek out these connections with california which were incidental to cottonwoods performance under the subcontract in georgia and utah as explained below we conclude these california connections are too attenuated and random to constitute purposeful availment and therefore may not support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over cottonwood i facts and procedural history owners are  limited liability companies that purchased a unit apartment complex in augusta georgia and held title to the apartments as tenants in common owners were formed in delaware for the sole purpose of purchasing the apartments they conducted no other business and each owners only asset was its interest in the apartments the members of each owner were individuals couples or family trusts that lived in  states with the members of  owners living in california none of owners members are parties to the underlying action owners financed the purchase of the apartments with a nearly  million loan secured by a deed of trust and security agreement in the loan documents owners agreed georgia law would govern any dispute relating to the loan and also agreed to submit to personal jurisdiction in georgia to resolve any dispute daymark is a california corporation with its principal place of business in orange county california in june  daymarks predecessor in interest entered into the property management agreement management agreement with owners to manage lease operate and maintain the apartments the management agreement designated daymark as the sole and exclusive manager of the apartments to act on behalf of owners and required daymark to keep the apartments clean and in good repair    order and supervise the completion of such repairs as may be required and    generally do and perform or cause to be done or performed all things necessary required or desirable for the proper and efficient management operation and maintenance of the apartments daymarks responsibilities under the management agreement included leasing the individual units collecting rent paying the mortgage taxes and other bills repairing and maintaining the apartments interacting with the tenants preparing an annual operating budget and plan for owners approval providing owners with quarterly financial reports establishing separate bank accounts for each owners share of the profits and maintaining books and records of the income and expenses attributed to each owners interest in the apartments at daymarks office in california the management agreement authorized daymark in its sole discretion to subcontract some or all of the property management functions described herein to local property managers and certain other parties finally the management agreement included a choiceoflaw provision designating georgia law but it required arbitration in orange county california for all disputes relating to the management agreement cottonwood is a delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in salt lake city utah in  representatives of cottonwood attended a conference in california where they met daymarks representatives this chance encounter led to two separate meetings in california when cottonwood representatives were attending other conferences during these california meetings cottonwood described its property management services and daymark shared information about the various portfolios of properties it held and managed the two companies did not discuss the terms of any particular deal during these meetings but rather simply got to know each others business after the california meetings daymark and its attorneys traveled to utah to meet with cottonwood the two companies negotiated drafted and agreed to an arrangement for cottonwood to purchase the right to manage various properties daymark managed including the apartments in georgia in november  cottonwood and daymark entered into the subproperty management agreement subcontract for cottonwood to perform daymarks property management responsibilities for the apartments the subcontract provides daymark hereby hires and retains cottonwood and cottonwood agrees to perform all of daymarks property management obligations under the management agreement subject to the exclusions terms and conditions contained in this subcontract collectively the services it is expressly understood that the services are to be provided on a subcontract basis and that this subcontract does not constitute an assignment of the management agreement or any right title or interest thereunder in exchange for cottonwood performing daymarks property management obligations daymark agreed to assign to cottonwood daymarks rights to payment of the management fee and the construction management fee and will instruct owners to pay the management fee and the construction management fee directly to an account designated by cottonwood in the subcontract cottonwood covenants and warrants that it fully understands and agrees to be subject to bound by and fully perform all of daymarks covenants agreements terms provisions and conditions of the management agreement arising as of the date hereof except i as such terms covenants agreements and provisions are specifically modified excluded or limited by this subcontract    the subcontract further provides it is not intended to give or confer any benefits rights privileges claims actions or remedies to owners or to any person or entity as a third party beneficiary or otherwise finally the subcontract includes a choiceoflaw provision designating delaware law but it does not include a forum selection or arbitration clause after a brief transition period cottonwood performed the daytoday management and maintenance services for the apartments through its onsite employees and contractors who were supervised by a regional manager located in georgia financial and other information relating to the apartments was compiled in georgia and transmitted to cottonwoods corporate offices in utah where cottonwood analyzed the information and prepared budgets plans reports and other documents concerning the apartments cottonwood stored this information in an online database it maintained in utah it provided owners with login information to access the database and also mailed hard copies of these documents to owners who requested them cottonwood provided notice to owners about the budgets and reports through email and standard mail from its offices in utah it also conducted regular conference calls to discuss its management and provided owners with the information necessary to participate in the calls or listen to recordings of previous calls the calls were initiated from cottonwoods offices in utah cottonwood experienced difficulties managing the apartments because they did not generate sufficient revenue to pay the operating expenses and service owners property loan initially cottonwood maintained the apartments by obtaining necessary services on credit and only paying for those services as they came due but eventually payment demands exceeded the available revenue cottonwood therefore made a capital call on all owners seeking the additional funds necessary to pay the outstanding bills while continuing to service the debt for the apartments when owners refused to comply with the capital call cottonwood lacked the funds necessary to pay the outstanding obligations including the loan on the apartments after owners missed several loan payments the lender foreclosed in  owners brought this action against cottonwood and daymark the operative first amended complaint alleged claims against cottonwood for breach of the subcontract breach of fiduciary duty accounting inducing breach of or intentional interference with the loan on the apartments intentional interference with prospective economic relations and negligent interference with prospective economic relations owners alleged cottonwood mismanaged the apartments and caused the foreclosure by paying certain operating expenses before paying the loan on the apartments failing to maintain the debt service coverage ratio required by the loan failing to timely provide the annual operating budget and other financial reports incurring unauthorized expenses failing to maintain required state and local licenses failing to make financial and other documents available to owners and making an unauthorized capital call owners served the summons and first amended complaint on cottonwoods agent for service of process in delaware and cottonwood responded by moving to quash service cottonwood argued it lacked sufficient minimum contacts with california to constitutionally subject it to personal jurisdiction in the state because cottonwood negotiated and entered into the subcontract with daymark in utah to manage the apartments in georgia and the alleged acts and omissions by cottonwood occurred in either georgia or utah owners opposed the motion arguing the totality of the circumstances surrounding the management agreement and the subcontract established sufficient minimum contacts with california because daymark is a california corporation cottonwood assumed daymarks obligations under the management agreement and the management agreement required certain obligations to be performed in california including making financial and certain other documents relating to the apartments available to owners providing budgets and financial reports to owners members and arbitrating any disputes under the management agreement the trial court agreed with owners and denied cottonwoods motion to quash cottonwood timely petitioned for writ relief code civ proc §  subd c we invited informal opposition and after reviewing that opposition we issued an order to show cause why a writ of mandate should not issue ordering the court to vacate its order denying cottonwoods motion to quash and enter a new order granting the motion after further briefing and oral argument we now address the petitions merits ii discussion a personal jurisdiction governing principles california courts may exercise personal jurisdiction on any basis consistent with the constitution of california and the united states citation the exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant comports with these constitutions if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice snowney v harrahs entertainment inc   calth   snowney the concept of minimum contacts    requires states to observe certain territorial limits on their sovereignty it ensures that the states through their courts do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system citations to do so the minimum contacts test asks whether the quality and nature of the defendants activity is such that it is reasonable and fair to require him to conduct his defense in that state snowney supra  calth at p  under the minimum contacts test personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific snowney supra  calth at p  a nonresident defendant may be subject to the general jurisdiction of the forum if his or her contacts in the forum state are substantial    continuous and systematic    such a defendants contacts with the forum are so wideranging that they take the place of physical presence in the forum as a basis for jurisdiction vons companies inc v seabest foods inc   calth   owners concede there is no basis for general jurisdiction over cottonwood in california and therefore we focus on specific personal jurisdiction when determining whether specific jurisdiction exists courts consider the relationship among the defendant the forum and the litigation citations a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if  the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits citation  the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendants contacts with the forum citations and  the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice snowney supra  calth at p  where a nonresident defendant challenges jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal jurisdiction citations the plaintiff must present facts demonstrating that the conduct of defendants related to the pleaded causes of action is such as to constitute constitutionally cognizable minimum contacts elkman v national states ins co   calappth   elkman if the plaintiff meets this initial burden then the defendant has the burden of demonstrating that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable snowney supra  calth at p  see greenwell v autoowners ins co   calappth   greenwell on review the question of jurisdiction is in essence one of law when the facts giving rise to jurisdiction are conflicting the trial courts factual determinations are reviewed for substantial evidence citation even then we review independently the trial courts conclusions as to the legal significance of the facts citations when the jurisdictional facts are not in dispute the question of whether the defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction is purely a legal question that we review de novo citation citations the ultimate issue of whether an exercise of jurisdiction is fair and reasonable is a legal determination subject to de novo review on appeal aquila inc v superior court   calappth   aquila b california lacks specific personal jurisdiction over cottonwood  the purposeful availment requirement the purposeful availment inquiry    focuses on the defendants intentionality citation this prong is only satisfied when the defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs its activities toward the forum so that it should expect by virtue of the benefit it receives to be subject to the courts jurisdiction based on its contacts with the forum snowney supra  calth at pp  purposeful availment requires that the defendant have performed some type of affirmative conduct which allows or promotes the transaction of business within the forum state stone v state of texas   calappth   stone thus the purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random fortuitous or attenuated contacts citations or of the unilateral activity of another party or a third person elkman supra  calappth at p  italics omitted instead the defendant will only be subject to personal jurisdiction if it has clear notice that it is subject to suit there and can act to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance passing the expected costs on to customers or if the risks are too great severing its connection with the state snowney supra  calth at p  for purposes of the purposeful availment prong the    united states supreme court has described the forum contacts necessary to establish specific jurisdiction as involving variously a nonresident who has purposefully directed his or her activities at forum residents citation or who has purposefully derived benefit from forum activities citation or purposefully availed himself or herself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws or deliberately has engaged in significant activities with a state citation or has created continuing obligations between himself and residents of the forum citation citation this disjunctive language along with the supreme courts rejection of mechanical or talismanic formulas citation suggests that the above formulations describe alternative but not mutually exclusive tests for purposeful availment citation courts must make the necessary assessment on a casebycase basis focusing on the nature and quality of the defendants activities in the state or with state residents greenwell supra  calappth at pp  elkman illustrates that simply having contacts with california or receiving some benefits from the state is not enough to establish purposeful availment the nonresident defendant must intentionally and voluntarily establish the requisite contacts with california in elkman a nonresident insurer issued a longterm care policy to the plaintiff when she lived in florida consistent with florida law the policy included a guaranteed renewal provision for the life of the plaintiff a few years later the plaintiff moved to california and from there she renewed the policy and continued to pay the premiums while still in california the plaintiff made a claim under the policy the insurer paid for six months of care but refused to pay for any further care based on the policys terms when the plaintiff sued in california to challenge the insurers policy interpretation the insurer moved to quash service for lack of personal jurisdiction elkman supra  calappth at pp  the insurer presented evidence showing it was a missouri corporation that had never been licensed or authorized to do business in california it maintained no office or bank account in california it had no agents licensed to sell its products in california and it never had advertised applied for approval to issue insurance or issued insurance in california in opposition the plaintiff presented evidence showing the insurer had nearly  insureds who lived in california and the insurer received premiums processed claims and paid claims from those insured in reply the insurer presented evidence showing these insureds moved to california after obtaining their policies and the insurer did not intentionally direct any activity toward california elkman supra  calappth at pp  the trial court granted the motion to quash service and the elkman court affirmed explaining we conclude that the insurer did not subject itself to specific jurisdiction in california merely by accepting premium payments from california and by processing and paying claims submitted by its insureds for services rendered in this state the insurer did not come here voluntarily no matter how many insureds did it was the unilateral decisions of the plaintiff and other insureds to relocate to california which caused the insurer to accept payments from this state and to process and pay claims for services rendered in this state these circumstances do not support a finding the insurer purposefully availed itself of forum benefits so as to make it subject to specific jurisdiction in california elkman supra  calappth at p  edmunds v superior court   calappth  edmunds illustrates that a nonresidents activities in california and directed toward the state do not establish purposeful availment if those activities merely are incidental to pursuit of interests or performance under a contract in another state in edmunds a california limited partnership hired a hawaii attorney to represent it when the partnership was sued in hawaii over a lease it held on real property located in hawaii during the representation the attorney came to california to represent the partnership at its deposition wrote letters and made phone calls from and to california and received payment for his services from california when the partnerships limited partners later sued the attorney for malpractice and other claims in california the attorney moved to quash service of process for lack of personal jurisdiction the trial court denied the motion and the attorney filed a writ petition challenging the courts order id at pp  the court of appeal granted the petition and directed the trial court to grant the attorneys motion because everything the attorney did was done in his capacity as a hawaii attorney and he thus lacks the necessary close relationship to the state of california in these matters to justify the assertion of personal jurisdiction over him edmunds supra  calappth at p  as the edmunds court explained the attorney was licensed to practice law in hawaii rather than california and he represented the partnership in hawaii state court litigation over real property located in hawaii the mere fact that to do so he came to california made phone calls and wrote letters to and from this state and accepted payment from a california client do not establish purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of california law because the actions were taken to further the attorneys financial interests in his hawaii law practice and the partnerships financial interests in the hawaii real property id at pp    cottonwood did not purposefully avail itself of any california benefits cottonwood contends the trial court erred in denying its motion to quash service because cottonwood did not intentionally engage in any conduct in or directed toward california that purposefully availed it of any california benefits we agree cottonwood is a delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in utah it does not have any offices employees agents bank accounts or assets in california it is not licensed to do business in california and although it manages property in nearly  states it never has managed property in california cottonwood never has advertised in california or otherwise directed any advertisements toward california residents cottonwoods only contacts with california derive from the subcontract it entered into with daymark which is a california corporation with its principal office in california entering into a contract with a california resident however is not enough for a nonresident defendant to purposefully avail itself of california benefits and be subject to specific personal jurisdiction here aquila supra  calappth at p  stone supra  calappth at p  burger king corp v rudzewicz   us   burger king to determine whether a nonresidents contractual relationship with a california resident constitutes purposeful availment a court must evaluate the contracts terms and all the surrounding circumstances including prior negotiations contemplated future consequences the parties course of dealings and the contracts choiceoflaw provision stone at p  burger king at pp  due process requires a substantial connection between the contract at issue and the forum state stone at p  for example in floyd j harkness co v amezcua   calappd  harkness a mexican farmer did not purposefully avail himself of california benefits by entering into a contract with a california corporation because the totality of the circumstances surrounding the contract demonstrated there was no substantial connection to california id at p  the parties negotiated the contract in arizona and mexico the corporation drafted and signed it in california and the farmer signed it in mexico under the contract the farmer agreed to grow vegetables in mexico and deliver them to the corporation in arizona and the corporation agreed to advance the cost of growing the vegetables to secure each advance the farmer signed promissory notes in mexico and delivered them to the corporations agent in arizona the corporation sent the advances from california to the farmers bank in arizona and the notes were payable in california when the farmer defaulted on the notes the corporation sued in california and the farmer moved to quash service id at pp  the trial court granted the motion and the court of appeal affirmed explaining the acts of making notes executed elsewhere by a nonresident defendant payable to a california resident in california or the acts of making interstate telephone calls relative to the performance of a contract executed outside the state and performed outside the state do not invoke the benefits and protections of our laws harkness supra  calappd at p  the court further explained the corporations activities in california were irrelevant to the question whether california had personal jurisdiction over the farmer because it is settled that we are not concerned with the performance of the plaintiff in california but exclusively with the nonresident defendants activities in this state it is the latter activities which must provide the basis for jurisdiction id at pp  here cottonwood likewise did not purposefully avail itself of any california benefits by negotiating entering into or performing the subcontract because there is no substantial connection between the subcontract and california cottonwood and daymark negotiated and entered into the subcontract in utah owners were not part of those negotiations and they are not parties to the subcontract under the subcontract cottonwood agreed to manage the georgia apartments for daymark on a subcontract basis cottonwood did not assume any of daymarks liabilities under the management agreement or any contractual obligations to owners indeed the subcontract expressly states it is not an assignment of the management agreement and owners are not third party beneficiaries and are not entitled to any benefits rights privileges claims actions or remedies under the subcontract cottonwood performed the daytoday management activities for the apartments in georgia and it performed various periodic administrative activities for the apartments at its offices in utah it performed no activities relative to the subcontract in california under the subcontract cottonwoods contacts with california were limited to sending communications about the apartments to a subset of owners that had members who happened to live in california the management agreement required daymark to periodically provide owners with information regarding the apartments and their operations including an annual budget an annual operating plan all information necessary for owners to prepare their taxes a report concerning any claims or complaints for damages and a quarterly financial report by entering into the subcontract cottonwood agreed to compile this information and communicate it to owners for daymark cottonwood did so by compiling the information in georgia generating budgets reports and other documents at its utah offices granting owners access to these documents via an online database cottonwood maintained in utah and mailing hard copies of the documents from utah to owners members who requested them cottonwood also initiated monthly conference calls from utah to discuss the apartments operations and it sent owners emails about those calls and other operational issues in june  cottonwood sent each owner a capital call when the revenue from the apartments proved insufficient to cover the operating expenses and service owners debt although cottonwoods communications with owners about the apartments reached california cottonwood did not purposefully seek or receive any california benefits by engaging in those communications indeed much like the insurers california connections in elkman were not purposeful because the insureds who lived in california moved here after the insurer issued their policies cottonwoods california connections were not purposeful because it contracted in utah to manage the georgia apartments for daymark and some members of the delaware limited liability companies that owned the apartments happened to live here see elkman supra  calappth at p  owners members also happened to live in  other states and each of the states where owners members lived lacked any direct or substantial connection to the subcontract or cottonwoods performance under the subcontract because none of owners member lived in either georgia or utah cottonwoods connection to each state where owners members lived therefore was entirely random and coincidental cottonwood did not enter into the subcontract seeking to establish a connection with any of these states see elkman supra  calappth at p  random fortuitous or attenuated forum contacts do not establish purposeful availment moreover the contacts established through cottonwoods communications with the handful of owners members who lived in california were incidental to the subcontracts purpose daymark did not hire cottonwood to communicate with owners members who lived in california it hired cottonwood to manage the apartments in georgia and keep owners informed about their upkeep wherever owners happened to be california contacts that merely are incidental to a nonresidents performance of a contract outside of california do not establish purposeful availment of california benefits edmunds supra  calappth at pp  hawaii attorney who represented california client at deposition in california and sent communications to and from california did not purposefully avail himself of california benefits because activities were incidental to representing client in hawaii state court litigation over hawaii real property harkness supra  calappd at p  communications to california regarding contract executed and performed outside california did not establish purposeful availment see re sanders  co v lincolnrichardson   calappd   mail and telephone communications to california plaintiff about outofstate investment did not constitute purposeful availment finally the absence of any intent by cottonwood to purposefully avail itself of california benefits is further demonstrated by the subcontracts choiceoflaw provision and its provision declaring owners are not third party beneficiaries and have no rights claims or remedies under the subcontract as stated above a contracts choiceoflaw provision is an important consideration in the purposeful availment analysis because it shows the nonresident intended to purposefully avail itself of the benefits and protections of the designated states laws burger king supra  us at p  cottonwood and daymarks agreement to be bound by delaware law therefore suggests they did not intend for the subcontract to have a significant connection with california see aquila supra  calappth at p  similarly by disclaiming any intent to create rights under the subcontract in owners cottonwood and daymark further demonstrated they did not intend owners or their location to have a role in the enforcement of the subcontract  owners failed to point to any aspect of the subcontract or cottonwoods performance that establishes purposeful availment to meet their burden in opposing the motion to quash owners point to various provisions in both the subcontract and the management agreement to show cottonwood purposefully availed itself of the benefits of conducting activities in california by entering into and performing the subcontract owners however misconstrue the governing standards and the agreements first owners contend cottonwood purposefully availed itself of california benefits because it created ongoing relationships and assumed continuing obligations with california residents—both daymark and owners with members who lived in california—simply by entering into the subcontract this argument fails for the reasons already discussed a nonresident does not purposefully avail itself of california benefits simply by contracting with a california resident aquila supra  calappth at p  and the totality of the circumstances show cottonwood did not purposefully avail itself of california benefits because the subcontract was entered into and called for performance outside of california with only incidental california connections edmunds supra  calappth at pp  harkness supra  calappd at p  second owners contend cottonwood purposefully availed itself of california benefits by entering into the subcontract because the agreement required cottonwood to perform at least one obligation in california owners point to the management agreements provision requiring daymark to maintain certain records regarding owners interests in the apartments and to make those records available to owners at daymarks office in california according to owners cottonwood assumed this obligation to maintain records in california by entering into the subcontract and agreeing to perform all of daymarks obligations under the management agreement not so the subcontract states cottonwood agreed to perform daymarks obligations under the management agreement except    as such terms covenants agreements and provisions are specifically modified excluded or limited by this subcontract elsewhere the subcontract states daymark will provide all information books and records for the apartments and for owners to the extent in daymarks possession to cottonwood all files then shall be kept at the apartments or at cottonwoods offices and will be available to daymark and owners cottonwood therefore never agreed to maintain any records in california and daymarks obligation to do so does not establish cottonwood purposefully availed itself of any california benefits next owners point to the arbitration provision in the management agreement as evidence cottonwood purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of california law that provision states daymark and owners agreed to submit any dispute relating to the management agreement to binding arbitration in orange county california based on that provision and the subcontracts provision stating cottonwood agreed to be bound by daymarks agreements in the management agreement owners argue cottonwood agreed to litigate any    disputes regarding the apartments management within orange county california thereby invoking the benefits and protections of california law in making this argument owners do not contend the management agreements arbitration provision is enforceable against cottonwood rather they simply argue it is evidence of cottonwood invoking the benefits and protections of california law when read with select provisions of the subcontract we are not persuaded because this contention ignores other provisions defining the limited scope of what cottonwood agreed to do by entering into the subcontract the management agreement authorized daymark to subcontract some or all of the property management functions described herein consistent with that provision the subcontract states cottonwood agrees to perform all of daymarks property management obligations under the management agreement    on a subcontract basis and this subcontract does not constitute an assignment of the management agreement owners are not parties to the subcontract and it expressly states they are not third party beneficiaries and have no rights privileges claims actions or remedies under the subcontract the subcontract does not include an arbitration provision nor does it have a forum selection clause designating orange county or any other forum accordingly when the two agreements are read together and in their entirety they show cottonwood did not agree to litigate any claims in california by entering into the subcontract even if the management agreement required daymark to do so owners also cite the subcontracts indemnity provision as evidence cottonwood purposefully availed itself of california benefits in the subcontract cottonwood agreed to defend and indemnify daymark from any claims or liabilities based on cottonwoods breach of the subcontract and daymark agreed to defend and indemnify cottonwood from any claims or liability based on daymarks breach of the management agreement or the subcontract according to owners any indemnity claims against cottonwood likely would arise out of litigation commenced in california because daymark is a california corporation several of owners members reside in california and the consultant owners hired to advise them about the apartments resides in california similarly owners contend any indemnity claim by cottonwood against daymark likely would be asserted in california because daymark is a california corporation owners therefore conclude cottonwood purposefully availed itself of california benefits because it is foreseeable any indemnity claims under the subcontract would arise in california we disagree owners speculation about where indemnity claims under the subcontract might arise—or even where they might be filed—does not establish personal jurisdiction over cottonwood liability and jurisdiction are independent citation liability depends on the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants and between the individual defendants jurisdiction depends only upon each defendants relationship with the forum goehring v superior court   calappth   goehring personal jurisdiction must be based on forumrelated acts that were personally committed by each nonresident defendant in re automobile antitrust cases i  ii   calappth   the purposes and acts of one party    cannot be imputed to a third party to establish jurisdiction over the third party defendant ibid not even when the parties are partners goehring at pp  coconspirators automobile antitrust cases at p  or parent and wholly owned subsidiary corporations aquila supra  calappth at p  as explained above cottonwood has not committed any forumrelated acts that would subject it to personal jurisdiction in california the subcontract was negotiated and entered into in utah and called for cottonwoods performance in georgia and utah any claims against daymark based on cottonwoods performance therefore would be based on cottonwoods acts or omissions in georgia or utah and would not subject cottonwood to personal jurisdiction in california even if daymark sought indemnity from cottonwood in california similarly daymarks status as a california corporation does not mean cottonwood must seek indemnity from daymark in california and daymarks california connections cannot be attributed to cottonwood owners fail to identify any act by cottonwood relating to the indemnity provision in the subcontract that would subject cottonwood to personal jurisdiction in california next owners contend cottonwood purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of california law by filing a ucc financing statement with the california secretary of state to perfect the security interest the subcontract granted cottonwood in daymarks right to payment under the management agreement owners are mistaken a nonresidents use of a california procedure to protect its security interest under a contract entered into and requiring performance in another state does not amount to purposeful availment of california benefits indeed several courts have rejected this same contention because the filing of financing statements is not akin to soliciting business in the forum introducing products into the forum or signing and performing a contract within the forum goehring supra  calappth at p  finally owners contend that if these california connections individually are not sufficient to establish purposeful availment they are sufficient when they are considered collectively again we disagree none of the individual contacts owners rely on establish any connections with california it therefore follows logically that no california connection is shown when those factors are considered as a whole because we conclude owners failed to meet their burden to establish purpose availment it is unnecessary to address the other prerequisites for the exercise of specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant ie whether the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendants contacts with the forum and whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice elkman supra  calappth at p  see jewish defense organization inc v superior court   calappth   disposition the petition for writ of mandate is granted let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the respondent court to vacate its order denying cottonwoods motion to quash service of process and enter a new

economic relations and wrongful foreclosure the lender is not a party to this writ proceeding  owners moved to augment the record with  pages from a deposition transcript they cited to the trial court but inadvertently failed to file with the court and  pages from a separate deposition transcript they neither cited nor filed with the trial court we deny the motion the record cannot be augmented with material that was not before the trial court in re marriage of forrest  eaddy   calappth   nonetheless considering those materials would not change our analysis or conclusions  owners point out cottonwood also entered into more than  other contracts similar to the subcontract to manage properties for daymark in numerous other states none of these contracts called for cottonwood to manage property in california moreover in determining whether minimum contacts exist it is the nature and quality of the contacts that is determinative not the quantity as you sow v crawford laboratories inc   calappth   as you sow we therefore focus on the contacts arising from the subcontract because owners contend the contacts arising from the other contracts are similar in nature and quality  owners contend harkness is distinguishable because the harkness plaintiff sought to establish the defendants purposeful availment based on the plaintiffs rather than the defendants forum activities although the plaintiff may have argued purposeful availment based on its forum contacts the court of appeal did not find a lack of purposeful availment on that ground rather the court of appeal properly considered the totality of the circumstances surrounding the parties contractual relationship to determine whether the defendant had purposefully availed himself of forum benefits owners efforts to distinguish harkness therefore are unpersuasive more importantly owners support their argument by citing to a california court of appeal opinion they acknowledge is unpublished bell v lihuang   wl  acknowledging the opinions unpublished status does not make citing it permissible california rules of court rule  prohibits citation to a california court of appeal opinion that was not certified for publication even though the opinion is publicly available through online databases people v williams   calappth   we caution counsel that citation to unpublished opinions may support an award of sanctions and counsel should refrain from doing so in the future see ibid alicia t v county of los angeles   calappd   indeed counsel would be well served to heed this advice by a leading treatise writer do not under any circumstances cite to an unpublished or depublished opinion or any unpublished part of a published opinion    unless    one of the narrow exceptions to the noncitation rule applies williams at p  italics omitted  shortly after entering into the subcontract with daymark cottonwood proposed contracting directly with owners to manage the apartments but owners declined  the presence of more owners and their members in california than any of the other  states does not change the analysis as explained above the determinative factor is the quality and nature of the contacts with the forum not the number as you sow supra  calappth at p   it is interesting to note that owners repeatedly have agreed that georgia law should govern disputes about the apartments and they even agreed to submit to personal jurisdiction in georgia the documents for owners loan on the apartments included a georgia choiceoflaw provision and a submission to personal jurisdiction in georgia for any dispute about the loan similarly although the management agreement states any dispute between owners and daymark must be arbitrated in california the management agreement also designates georgia
