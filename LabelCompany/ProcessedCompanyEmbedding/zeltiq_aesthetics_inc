company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing its proprietary controlledcooling technology platform the company’s first commercial product the coolsculpting® system is designed to selectively reduce stubborn fat bulges that may not respond to diet or exercise coolsculpting is based on the scientific principle that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the overlying skin and surrounding tissues coolsculpting utilizes precisely controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area which is intended to cause fat cell elimination through a natural biological process known as apoptosis  we developed coolsculpting to safely noticeably and measurably reduce the fat layer within a treated fat bulge without requiring the patient to diet or exercise

coolsculpting units we have for sale by visiting our current zeltiq inventory page if you have any questions about our zeltiq systems or need further assistance we encourage you to contact us so that we can best serve you zeltiq coolsculpting system the effectiveness of the coolsculpting system is based upon the process of cryolipolysis which was discovered and developed at massachusetts general hospital a decade ago in short cryolipolysis hinges upon the observation that the cells comprising fatty tissues in the body are more vulnerable to low temperatures than other tissues in the body by cooling a specific region of the body–selective cryolysis–fat cells are induced to undergo cell death apoptosis prompting the immune system to attack and reabsorb the dead cells the coolsculpting procedure begins with an applicator being placed against the targeted area of the body the applicator creates a vacuum drawing the underlying skin and tissue up against two recessed cooling panels in the handpiece then the system begins extracting energy from the tissue underneath lowering local tissue temperature the lipids in fat cells in the area crystallize killing the cells the chemical composition of other tissues such as skin nerves and muscles is such that they are more tolerant of these temperatures and the coolsculpting system carefully monitors and manages the process so that temperatures are maintained below those that fat cells can endure but above temperatures that would damage other tissues ultimately everything but fatty tissues emerge from the cryolipolysis process unscathed as the body absorbs these damaged fat deposits noticeable thinning occurs and fat layers in treated areas of the body are noticeably thinned improved body shape is apparent for at least six months after initial treatment the only side effects of the procedure are minimal reddening of the skin and very occasionally some bruising or swelling contact us please select an options beloware you
