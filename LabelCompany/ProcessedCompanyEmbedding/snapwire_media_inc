of that good customer service which is very important my only regret is to not have using it earlier  ps and to respond to user who rate  svetoslav bonev sorry but maybe this is because the quality of your pictures submitted are not enough so i recommend you to use some other app where they accept anything maybe you got more chance there to be frank with you i have just started not even a month and im already expert with a lot of nominations so your statement is not true  good luck angel osorio cool im starting to really like this app not only does it challenge you as a photographer and step into new grounds as far as photography but it can also earn you money i havent earned anything yet but ive gotten a couple of nominations and some photos added onto the market place teymur myasoutov overall i really like it and am willing to continue to use it though the desktop experience is far better because looking through google requests and trying to find a specific one is a nightmare please add alphabetical sorting or sorting by location plus opening links through the app doesnt show the shared request just opens the default tab mike evans great app i am new to this app and love the freedom to express oneself in a marketplace environment i gave  stars because the initial level up isnt easy to attain for inexperienced amatures like me and to really advance and sell its required to level up i will keep trying and when i can see more of this app i will give it a  star lisa norris i reinstalled hoping this app would be fixed as i love snapwire but i am still getting error cant connect and can not even sign in manually or through facebook its been months it used to work what happened and why hasnt it been fixed yet totally disappointed roxana stratila great but hi i really like this appreally nicely built and maintained still i recently changed my phone and when i try to log in with facebook on the new device it just loads and then takes me back to the log in

watch out facebook this is the next big thing yet without the drama i love snapwireits super fundamental upload photos get creative learn new techniques browsefollow awesome artistsphotographersshow your talent even get paid for ityou cant chat backforth communicate wother photographersbuyers unless u comment on a reqchallenge wall but that is no downfalltrust me it keeps the beautyintention of this social media place true to its vision to be focused on the talentart of photography the individuals behind itwithout any dramawell done chad newell full review lj bazinga june   my new addiction fantastic site library that features affordable stock photos for companies a place for photo art lovers to aquire and view thousands and thousands of incredible photos and somewhere for truly gifted photographers to actually be acknowledged  paid for their work winwinwin full review lamarcus smith march   ok i see why i deleted it the first time your limited on the photo size you can post then nobody really buy nothing plus the challenges are not realistic  of people cant up and travel places i had more sales at an art show dont waist your time just go to an art show now it saying no internet connection wtf full review rick nofel march   i dont know if this app works anymore the website has a lot of buttons that dont work when you click them also nothing ive posted on the website shows up in my app there are no current requests available only challenges i have a few photos that are currently the only photos nominated for challenges so well see if anything happens full review l reedy march   love this app but wont connect wont connect for weeks now and cant log in i have emailed support with no resolution app keeps erroring no internet connection but all my other apps are connecting fine galaxy note  full review rob williams october   great but not for the casual photographer the casual photographer takes many pics with their cell phone and maybe a dozen come out looking professional this app is purely for the professional photographer who uses their cell not to take pics but to negotiate prices of pics they sell on the app not for me full review artem repka september    well i really love the interface and the animations everything is smooth the main idea is also cool and this app is better that the other ones like foap clashot etc because it has a thing called requests so for people who want to buy someones photos it is easier to find you well its a bit hard to explain for me though you have to try it to understand its benefits beneath clashot and other apps full review eric prochnow september   too selective disappointed i switched phones and lost therefore lost access to my account since then all the beginner missions have been location specific for the past several months or expecially difficult like rio olympics really the requests are things i can do but the missions are only things a very small percentage of lucky people can get nominated for fix this this is not working full review fae lynne july   youre not selling your photos for actual money  youre entering contests and you get nothing if you dont win this isnt communicated to you until you go to actually use the app and its not even clear then they expect you to figure it out through the guidelines for each request then if you do decide to enter your pictures are declined because their app gets picture qualities wrong  all of mine are taken with a mpx camera but are denied because their app claims theyre only mpx if you finally do find one that it accepts it takes nearly ten minutes just to upload im done this app is more trouble than its worth full review retro gaming may   love it finally someone has released a way for people to get paid for doing something they love i tried some of the other apps and websites but none of them even came close to providing the sort of service that people are looking for full review edwin chua december   there should be an easier way to filter or sort the challenges available by location nearest to you imagine scrolling over  challenges to see that none of them are related to you  word annoying full review jonathan newton november   cant log in ill change the rating when you guys fix the issue i try to log in with my email and password and it says no internet connection try to log in with facebook and i get an invalid hash key blah blah the app was cool on my other phone this sucks full review sunny ghosh december   only for people who live in north america and europe and australia this is not for every one kinda defeats the purpose of making this available worldwide but only have challenges for people of north america and europe bogus with love from india full review jessica pombo july   love it so far although my profile picture and background picture become squished and contorted once i save them am i doing something wrong full review aimless amoeba january   i like it so farjust starting the idea is great but they really need a search feature or nearby feature for the challenge and requests its timeconsuming to have to scroll through seemingly endless challengesrequests before finding one thats doable full review kimberly hebert november   wtf i downloaded this app  days ago it would be nice if it would actually connect instead of wasting my data i have a galaxy note  yall need to fix this because it may only be  of users of your app that experience this problem regardless of make  model of phone but everyone that chooses to download your app should be able to at least try it for themselves  just to see if its worth keeping full review eric barkkari june   addicting i find myself looking at my phone constantly i am still waiting to get nominated and it becomes frustrating  but i dont quit and will keep trying all in all this app has brought out a passion in me that was hidden full review david anaka december   no internet connection your logging in with the wrong info this happened to me unfortunately to reset the app you have to uninstall and then reinstall make sure you have the right emailpassword or you get this error and cant go back without uninstalling weird glitch full review waka november   not good at all its boring most challenges are impossible to take part because individuals have to travel to specific locations to take pictures there and be a part of the competitions layout of the app is boring it does nothing to capture the attention of the users and thats not what a photo app should be boring full review esraa hossam january   even if i have a good internet connection it always shows me the note of no internet connection i uninstalled it and reinstall it again and its the same problem i cant do anything to it full review athul mk january   unable to login while logging in from my mobile it always says no internet connection model lg l android full review mohamed ibrahim april   its a good app but u have to add the option of searching missions by name there are hundreds of googles missions and i cant find the one related to my location i keep scrolling but theyre so many they never end full review kishori dorsey september   great buisness this app gives you the chance to showcase your photography talents in a safe way while building up your reputation earning your clients make money just doing what u do best posting it to your acct and showcasing your passion full review eric sanchez december   i just downloaded the app and its telling me i have no internet connection my wifi is working perfectly but the app doesnt seem to pick it up full review multiorange december   snapwire love the app n easy money so i can help feed my family trying my best but also trying to enjoy and share photos full review ce te prawoso march   no one paid every challenges they didnt pay for any pictures could they steal our pictures maybe full review ethan chinapen march   its an amazing app its an easy way to make money for your google play account its simple to use and you can see the amazing pics that people around the world put up full review tartarus poseidon december   problem to connect with facebook why i cant log in with fb that it i upload my photo from my computer to snap wire web full review thebe suping february   mainly for people in america certain challenges request for photos that were taken in north america and europe which really doesnt cater for all photographers word wide full review rachel lowles january   seems great so far ive only installed this app today it loaded fine was easy to set up andive uploaded a dozen pictures without any problems only time will tell if i can sell anything but im excited to try full review march   just download and signed up first photo challenge they had for me was in berlin i registered myself in california as it asked soo maybe more local challenges might be better for the new guys updates to come full review calvin kloer november   wont connect ive used this before and liked it and i tried to install in on my new phone and it says i have no internet connection full review michelle thompson july   great app i really enjoy snapwire i dont get too use it as much as id like but still a great app full review hans a may   horribly not working the app always gives me an unable to
