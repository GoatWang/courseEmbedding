efficient energy resources explore the map to learn how it takes a significant amount of energy to extract and produce the copper and other minerals rio tinto kennecott provides we are committed to finding more efficient ways to power our operation and reduce our energy consumption combined heat and power system at kennecott we are committed to researching and implementing additional ways of increasing power supply and energy efficiency throughout our operations the new million megawatt mw combined heat and power chp system that we commissioned in december  at our refinery is an excellent example of this commitment the chp system is more than  percent energy efficient compared to separate heat and power systems which are estimated to be less than  percent efficient the mw chp system produces enough electricity to power  averagesized homes chp also known as cogeneration is an efficient clean and reliable approach to generating power and thermal energy from a single fuel source the refinery chp system meets the steam requirements of the refinery and provides up to  percent of the electrical needs of the plant the steam produced by waste heat from this chp system replaces steam that was previously supplied by a natural gas boiler system it increases the facilitys operational efficiency and decreases energy costs at the same time chp reduces the emission of greenhouse gases which contribute to global climate change chp technology represents an innovative approach to energy planning because the electrical power is being generated onsite rather than at an offsite power plant  an approach called distributed generation the chp system uses a naturalgasfired turbine generator combined with a heatrecovery steam boiler to capture heat from hot turbine exhaust for the efficient production of process steam used at the refinery in addition to powering  percent of the plants electrical needs the chp system reduces air emissions by more than  percent  with the addition of the refinery chp our power supply from alternative and highefficiency power sources is now at  percent  key benefits of our chp system produces up to  mw per hour — equivalent to the electrical needs of  averagesize homes produces up to  pounds of steam per hour provides distributed onsite steam and power production for use in the copper refining process improves power generating efficiency to above  percent compared to about  percent for traditional power plants diversifies our energy generation portfolio and improves power reliability smelter cogeneration the smelter captures and converts the waste heat from the flash smelting and converting furnaces at the acid plant to generate about twothirds of its electrical demands the smelter recovers the heat as a lowpressure steam which is combined with exhaust steam from the acid plant steam turbine compressors the steam makes its way to the powerhouse where up to  megawatts of electricity can be produced in a steam turbine generator solar and wind an important part of ensuring responsible mineral production is to continually reduce the environmental impact of our energy supply kennecott has made a number of energy supply improvements including the increased usage of renewable energy such as microwind turbines and solar photovoltaic pv systems kennecott has installed five microwind turbines or windspires to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about  metric tons per year they can generate up to  kilowatts of renewable energy when wind conditions are favorable the windspires generate approximately  kilowatts of electricity each year which is about the amount consumed by one average home in addition to generating renewable energy this system collects valuable wind sunlight and temperature data which can be used to determine the location’s solar resource to predict the output of future solar pv systems at kennecott the pv system is part of a rio tinto initiative to install solar monitoring systems at all its operations rio tinto has installed more than  systems already primarily in australia the data collected will help rio tinto prioritize where to install larger solar pv systems globally as they become more competitive with traditional sources of electricity idle reduction program the awardwinning vehicle idling reduction program started in  as a pilot program and continues to grow each year the goal is to have  percent of our vehicles fitted with global positioning system gps insight monitoring equipment the gps insight monitoring system tracks location idling time fuel usage speed and other vehicle metrics the idle reduction program has been highly successful and has returned many benefits in fuel savings and emission reductions since  the program has grown from  vehicles to  vehicles and has resulted in more than  tonnes of coe this program has also created greater cultural awareness of the impacts of idling employees are not only reducing idling at work they are taking this thinking home and reducing their idling in the community for more information please click here cng vehicle program in the spirit of energy efficiency the kennecott operational services team commenced a program to pilot the use of compressed natural gas fuel in our light and mediumduty vehicles in  this pilot included the trial of  different cng vehicle conversion systems and installation of a cng fueling station at our northern operations replacing gasoline with cng reduced both criteria emissions and greenhouse gas emissions initially three different vehicle types were considered for our light and mediumduty fleet — electric hybrid and cng — and were evaluated to determine which type would be most feasible we chose compressed natural gas technology for this project due to the technology being available for installation in the mediumduty fleet a roughly fiveyear payback period on conversions and the minimal differences between conventional fossilfuel vehicle maintenance and cng vehicle maintenance once cng was selected kennecott initiated a pilot project to determine the feasibility of using cng vehicles given the pilot’s large success we committed to increasing the use of cng vehicles across the operation we also installed a cng fueling station on the north end of our operation with plans to install an additional station we have since increased our fleet and currently operate  cng vehicles all vehicles converted to cng are epa certified we chose to use epacertified conversion equipment as it has been thoroughly tested and conforms to the highest standards of operation to date  ghg emissions have been prevented these steps have saved more than  million in fuel fuel efficiency has remained the same relative to conventional gasoline mileage for new vehicles efficiency for maintenance lubricants has risen as motor oil changes are scheduled every  miles versus every  miles for conventional gasoline motors which is expected to increase to  miles in the next year   environment air quality water management land managementhistoric cleanup inland sea shorebird reserve energy alternative view construction project  › renewable
