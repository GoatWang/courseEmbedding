remaining term and wam are each calculated based upon the term from the current month to the earlier of the anticipated repayment date if applicable and the maturity date  data in this table was calculated by allocating prorata the current loan information to the properties based upon the cutoff date balance of the related mortgage loan as disclosed in the offering document the scheduled balance totals reflect the aggregate balances of all pooled loans as reported in the crefc loan periodic update file to the extent that the scheduled balance total figure for the “state” and property” stratification tables is not equal to the sum of the scheduled balance figures for each state or property the difference is explained by loans that have been modified into a split loan structure the “state” and “property” stratification tables do not include the balance of the subordinate note sometimes called the bpiece or a “hope note” of a loan that has been modified into a splitloan structure rather the scheduled balance for each state or property only reflects the balance of the senior note sometimes called the apiece of a loan that has been modified into a splitloan structure  all
