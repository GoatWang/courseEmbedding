fighter  ad premiered in  it was written and drawn by russ manning and as a nod to its influences included isaac asimovs three laws of robotics as a quote in the beginning of the first issue for the duration of the titles original run magnus battled rogue robots aliens space pirates and other threats he fell in love with leeja clane the daughter of one of north ams senators leeja developed limited telepathic abilities after training by mree and other humans who had acquired them as a result of their minds being linked together while imprisoned in suspended animation by h the series was popular in the s as the s approached sales began to decline the last issue  was published in january  however manning only completed  issues the rest were reprints of previous issues or new stories by others – the original concept is a deliberate inversion or update of the tarzan mythos the syndicated comic strip which russ manning had previously illustrated where tarzan was a human raised as a noble savage feral child by african great apes who saw the world through his naturalistic upbringing and opposition to the rules and limits of civilization magnus was a human raised by a benevolent robot named a who saw mankind becoming an ever more decadent and complacent human civilization doomed by its everincreasing dependence on robots in one case the hero is a throwback to a hardier and more naturalistic time in the other he is a creation of science sent to carry the message to the rest of humanity that man must control his own destiny and carve out his own path rather than become little more than an overfed herd of cattle tended by robots in both incarnations of magnus robot fighter he lives and operates according to his own set of rules and because of this is considered an outsider and something of a threat to the established order of things backup seriesedit in the early s a new magnus backup series ran in the new doctor solar title in issues – this was supposed to

that magnus was actually born during the unity conflict he was a child of a harbinger named torque and a woman named kris hathaway geomancer geoff mchenry sensed that someone like magnus was needed in the future so solar transported the baby magnus to the future where he was picked up by the solar from that time period and delivered to a it was also revealed that magnuss strength wasnt solely due

premiseedit by the year  humanity has become dependent on robots h the polrob robot police chief of the civic sector of north am a continentspanning megacity is damaged in a radiation accident it seeks to promote the human dependency on robots and gradually impose totalitarian rule in the area under its control magnus was raised by a robot known as a a name which implies that he is the very first robot of his type ever manufactured a seems to be selfaware and possess emotions a firm believer in the three laws of robotics a recognized the threat represented by the dependency of humans on robots in general and the developments in north am due to h in particular therefore a trained magnus to protect humans against both rogue robots and humans who used normal robots for evil purposes magnus was trained from infancy by a in an undersea domed house using advanced techniques to become a skilled martial artist who could break steel with his bare hands in addition a equipped his charge with a device that would allow him to hear robottorobot radio communications leeja is magnuss girlfriend robots that served as police are called polrobs as in police robots and are painted black and white like city police cars all robots have identifying numbers painted on their chest and backs other robots such as taxi drivers could be nothing more than a torso with arms and head attached to a flying automobile settingedit both the gold key and valiant versions take place in north am a megalopolis that encompasses the entire north american continent the city consists of several levels the higher levels are populated by wealthier individuals often regarded as soft and complacent the lowest level the goph level is populated by a hardier and less educated class known as gophs by ad  the nation of japan is home to  billion people the major islands of japan are covered by a single contiguous structure known as the host grandmother a freewill electronic network controls virtually every facet of daily life aside from north am earth also features a city on the continent of antarctica named antarcto the city consists of several transparent domes inside each of which the climate is carefully controlled construction of these habitats was fiercely opposed for fear of ecological damage to the fragile antarctic system as well there is the area known as himalhina which apparently includes at least all of india and china charactersedit magnus robot fighter a the freewill robot mentor of magnus and lover of grandmother whom he calls kimi claiburne president of north am leeja

robot nation of synchron york timbuc a major later a colonel in north ams military xyrkol brilliant but psychopathic alien scientist who seeks to rule north am gold keyedit original seriesedit the original series titled magnus robot fighter  ad premiered in  it was written and drawn by russ manning and as a nod to its influences included isaac asimovs three laws of robotics as a quote in the beginning of the first issue for the duration of the titles original run magnus battled rogue robots aliens space pirates and other threats he fell in love with leeja clane the daughter of one of north ams senators leeja developed limited telepathic abilities after training by mree and other humans who had acquired them as a result of their minds being linked together while imprisoned in suspended animation by h the series was popular in the s as the s approached sales began to decline the last issue  was published in january  however manning only completed  issues the rest were reprints of previous issues or new stories by others – the original concept is a deliberate inversion or update of the tarzan mythos the syndicated comic strip which russ manning had previously illustrated where tarzan was a human raised as a noble savage feral child by african great apes who saw the world through his naturalistic upbringing and opposition to the rules and limits of civilization magnus was a human raised by a benevolent robot named a who saw mankind becoming an ever more decadent and complacent human civilization doomed by its everincreasing dependence on robots in one case the hero is a throwback to a hardier and more naturalistic time in the other he is a creation of science sent to carry the message to the rest of humanity that man must control his own destiny and carve out his own path rather than become little more than an overfed herd of cattle tended by robots in both incarnations of magnus robot fighter he lives and operates according to his own set of rules and because of this is considered an outsider and something of a threat to the established order of things backup seriesedit in the early s a new magnus backup series ran in the new doctor solar title in issues – this was supposed to lead to a new magnus title but gold key stopped publication soon afterwards supposedly there was work completed for two new magnus issues what would have been magnus   but these have never been published valiantedit in  jim shooter obtained rights to three gold key characters doctor solar man of the atom turok son of stone and magnus robot fighter he intended to use those characters to launch his new comic book line valiant comicscitation needed several months later the company launched magnus robot fighter the series began where the original one left off the artists took great care to replicate the setting and trappings of the original storiescitation needed but as the new series progressed it began to deviate from the original conceptcitation needed the term freewills appeared in the valiant run introducing the concept that the rogue robots seen previously were not simply the product of random malfunctions but were the result of a common phenomenon which allowed robots to become sentientcitation needed while some of them are malevolent others merely want to be free it was also learned that a is a freewill with magnuss help a colony of benevolent freewills is established called the steel nation at the same time magnus becomes disgusted with north ams elite he journeys to the lower levels of north am and befriends a group of social outcasts known as gophs in  valiant published the popular crossover predator versus robot fighter valiant president steven massarsky recounted we started this project in february  knowing that this time of the year john ostrander would be taking things over in magnus so we want to generate renewed interest in magnus as the series progressed it was used to introduce other heroes to the valiant universe in issue  a japanese hero known as rai began appearing in magnuss title and would eventually move on into his own series in the sixth issue the future version of solar made his debut the issue also introduced the spider aliens who became a recurring threat throughout the valiant universe in the th issue modern readers were reintroduced to turok son of stone unityedit during the unity crossover it was revealed that magnus was actually born during the unity conflict he was a child of a harbinger named torque and a woman named kris hathaway geomancer geoff mchenry sensed that someone like magnus was needed in the future so solar transported the baby magnus to the future where he was picked up by the solar from that time period and delivered to a it was also revealed that magnuss strength wasnt solely due to his martial arts training rather it was a harbinger ability inherited from his father the malev waredit shortly after the unity crossover the future earth was invaded by alien robots called malevs directed by the giant brain introduced in the original series that encompassed the planet of malev  this invasion forced all of the future heroes to band together their adventures were showcased in a spinoff title rai and the future force after the malev war ended all future titles jumped twenty years forward magnus became the leader of north am he married leeja his love interest since the original series and had a son whom he named torque magnus spent the rest of the series battling various threats during the chaos effect crossover he was transported to the th century but he eventually returned to the future trade paperbacksedit steel nation collects issues – written by jim shooter art by art nichols  bob layton invasion collects

raised and trained by battlestone who was working for the harbinger foundation in this series magnuss parents were both killed by battlestone while trying to escape the harbinger foundation years later magnus would confront battlestone about this and fight him to more or less a standstill while geoff mchenry the geomancer of earth would lament that reality was literally coming to an end around them the world ends as magnus and battlestone fight to the death acclaim comicsedit in  voyager communications the company that owned valiant comics was bought by acclaim entertainment at first it

in  acclaim entertainment relaunched its comic book division all valiant comics characters were altered and rebooted including magnus this time magnus was reimagined as an insane robot fighter who in addition to the originals strength and skills had metallic blood that repaired his injuries the series was much more comedic and selfparodying than any of the previous incarnations two years later acclaim comics closed and magnuss title was one of the first to go along with most of the line unity edit in  acclaim entertainment made a final attempt to revive its comic book line and jim shooter was invited to write a unity  crossover due to financial troubles within the company only three issues of six were published the valiant version of magnus played an important role in the crossover
