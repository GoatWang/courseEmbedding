directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

namesake news of pottrucks removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped  percent to  million for the second quarter driven largely by a  percent decline in revenue from customer stock trading after coming back into control mr schwab conceded that the company had lost touch with our heritage and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to

ten times since the return of charles schwab the company’s net transfer assets or assets that come from other firms quadrupled from  to  schwab yieldplus fund this fund was named as one of the decades top ten fund disasters for the s “in written materials and in conversations with customers some schwab representatives omitted or provided incomplete or inaccurate material information relating to the funds characteristics risk and diversification and continued to represent yieldplus as a relatively lowrisk alternative to money market funds and other cash alternative investments that had minimal fluctuations in net asset value nav between sept   and feb   schwab sold over  billion in shares of yieldplus to customers which accounted for approximately  percent of the amount schwab customers invested in ultra shortterm bond funds during this time period schwabs solicited sales of yieldplus totaled approximately  billion approximately  percent of which were to customers  years of age or older schwab collected approximately  million in fees from sales of the fund”  from june  through june  the total return on schwab’s yieldplus fund yieldplus held large amounts of securities backed by illiquid longterm private label mortgages it also held long maturity corporate bonds and trust preferred securities in doing so schwab’s fund violated concentration and illiquidity limits stated in its prospectus and had much more credit and liquidity risk than it disclosed in its sec filings and marketing materials yieldplus’ long term securities including private label mortgage backed securities gave it a slight advantage over its peers prior to  unfortunately the extra yield was an order of magnitude smaller than the losses that followed when credit and liquidity spreads widened and the value of its long term holdings dropped significantly in  and  was  when other ultra short bond funds had little or no losses these large losses occurred because schwab’s yieldplus fund was not an ultra short bond fund as claimed by schwab it was instead an ultra long bond fund yieldplus’s heaviest reported losses occurred in early  yet schwab still appears to have understated these losses by significantly inflating the value of the fund’s holdings and therefore its navthe yieldplus fund made large risky investments in long maturity structured products such as subprime residential mortgage backed securities “rmbs” that were inconsistent with the sec’s definition of an ultra short bond fund schwab marketed the fund as a cash equivalent investment and as a safe alternative to money market funds with a higher yield and only slightly more risk such a claim would be incorrect for a typical conventionally managed ultra short bond fund but was especially false when made by schwab on behalf of the yieldplus fund in its marketing materials schwab compared returns on the yieldplus fund to returns on the lehman short us treasury  month index the treasury securities included in the lehman index have no credit risk are highly liquid and have short maturities the holdings of the yieldplus fund generally shared none of these attributes  yieldplus had  billion of investor losses including losses by the founder himself schwab closed the yieldplus funds in   in  the company acquired the k company on july   walter w bettinger the previous chief
