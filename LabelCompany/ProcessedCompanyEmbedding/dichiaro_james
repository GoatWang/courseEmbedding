placement  huffpost tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you edition us arabi australia brasil canada deutschland españa france greece india italia japan korea maghreb méxico québec south africa united kingdom united states close books 9  am et  updated apr 9  writers james bond and the perils of product placement by david gaughran for indiereadercom it’s one of the most recognizable quotes in the history of cinema “shaken but not stirred” the phrase perfectly encapsulated the nature of james bond and has since become synonymous with the suave british spy its first appearance was in ian fleming’s fourth bond novel diamonds are forever although bond himself didn’t utter the words until the sixth outing dr no – halfway through the muchloved series the movie franchise did a lot more to immortalize the phrase and it appeared from the very first installment dr no and in virtually every bond movie since with some notable exceptions it’s symbolic of james bond’s quintessential characteristics – sophistication – which explains why fans have reacted so angrily to reports that he will be trading his martini for a heineken in the upcoming skyfall this isn’t the first time that bond’s traditions have been tampered with his usual aston martin was swapped for a bmw in goldeneye presumably for a large check which caused a similar backlash critics argue that throughout the fleming novels numerous novelizations by other authors and twentytwo movies to date that have featured the spy there are only a few remaining signifiers that make bond who he is his code number  his looks and taste for amorous adventures and his sophistication and sense of style – of which the martini with its explicit instructions for preparation is a key part i’m sure the anger is compounded by the replacement beverage being something as unsophisticated as beer and something as universal and generic as heineken and i’m also confident that nobody is surprised to hear the release of the movie will be accompanied by a worldwide advertising campaign from heineken featuring bond swilling their lager aside from the muchderided temporary switch to bmw this is hardly the first instance of product or brand placement in bond movies since the very first installment in 9 bond movies have featured british airways panam perrier finlandia vodka smirnoff ford omega mattel calvin klein virgin atlantic revlon samsonite sony ericcson kodak and many more i’m sure ian fleming’s literary estate would defend the practice as monetizing something that was native to fleming’s writing anyway he often mentioned brands like cartier and received no compensation however fans would be justified in arguing that mentions of products have become increasingly shameless with a scene in casino royale namedropping omega attracting particular scorn product placement in movies and television has become so ubiquitous that it has led to widespread parody faux product placement the invention of fictional productsbrands such as kwikemart in the simpsons reverse placement the rebranding of reallife  stores as kwikemarts in  and product displacement where mercedezbenz asked the makers of slumdog millionaire to remove their iconic logo from scenes featuring their cars in slum settings such product placement isn’t as common in books but it has a long history when jules verne began serializing around the wold in eighty days in  transport and shipping companies lobbied to be mentioned it should be noted that verne claimed the novel was inspired by a thomas cook advertisement in a parisian newspaper however without a doubt the most shameless literary product placement was in a pulpy detective novel from 9 called never kill a client by brett halliday the book was part of a longrunning and hugely popular series featuring private detective mike shayne in one early scene in never kill a client shayne is on the scent of a case and boards a flight to los angeles taking a seat next to a passenger reading another of brett halliday’s books the narrator goes on to say “it wasn’t a rare occurrence for shayne to see some complete stranger reading one of halliday’s books with thirty million copies of them sold in soft cover editions it would have been queerer if you didn’t run into them now and then and shayne also knew that she woke to darkness had recently been reissued in a new cover and there were probably several hundred thousand copies of it in the hands of readers throughout the country” the conversation between shayne and the passenger about halliday’s oeuvre continues for another two pages such an aside is probably made easier by the fact that brett halliday was a penname the writer davis dresser was an interesting character who wore an eyepatch since a childhood accident with barbed wire aside from a voluminous writing output he was also a founding member of the mystery writers of america of which his wife fellow author helen mccloy later became the first female president there is no doubt that dresser’s tongue is firmly planted in his cheek in the above as fun is poked at several of his novels however it quite clearly shows the possibilities for advertisers to shoehorn their way into fictional narratives the advent of ebooks makes such marketing tieins a lot more attractive to brands as any author who has been interviewed for a newspaper will know a clickable link can make all the difference between a bump in sales and no effect whatsoever publishers and selfpublishers have been circling the idea of advertising in ebooks for some time straight advertising can be intrusive and can also provoke a negative reaction even if advertising in books is nothing new and has long been common in things like travel guides product placement is usually more subtle and allows marketers to tap into the emotional connection that people have with the writer’s characters the attraction of the idea is obvious it’s an additional revenue stream and potentially a very lucrative one while product placement in novels is unlikely to attract the kind of prices we are seeing in movies skyfall is aiming to bring in over m in product placement fees there is no doubt that the biggest selling books could command considerable prices for selfpublishers the attraction lies in monetizing free or cheap content after all a book could be permanently free if it was subsidized sufficiently by advertising or product placement fees however as the james bond outcry shows there are clear dangers here it seems there is a small step between getting paid for something you are doing anyway mentioning how much a character loves their converse and radically altering the characteristics of your hero or your plot to suit a corporate agenda david gaughran is the author of the south american historical adventure a storm hits valparaiso and the short stories if you go into the woods and transfection as well as the popular
