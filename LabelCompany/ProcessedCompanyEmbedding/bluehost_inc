supporting unmetered disk space or data transfer bandwidth we do not have defined limitations these resources are unmetered meaning you are not billed according to the amount of disk space or bandwidth used while of course these resources are not infinite we believe our customers should have all the resources necessary to build an online presence and  of customers will have more than enough disk space and bandwidth to meet their needs that said we do require all customers to be fully compliant with our terms of service and utilize disk space and bandwidth in a manner consistent with the normal operation of a website while rare we occasionally constrain accounts utilizing more resources than should be the case in the normal operation of a personal or small business website how do you determine normal operation we regularly examine customer bandwidth and disk space utilization data in a series of statistical analyses and use the results to define normal although these tests vary from month to month one thing remains constant  of our customers fall into normal range if your accounts bandwidth or disk space utilization causes any concern you will receive an email asking you to reduce usage we strive to provide at least  hours notice to allow customers to make adjustments before we take any corrective action it is very rare for a customer to exceed normal usage while managing a website typically customers only experience issues if they use their accounts for storage for example large multimedia files or file sharing our hosting services are not intended to support these activities and in accordance with our terms of service your disk space and bandwidth usage must be integrated into the normal operation of a website we offer various plans that better address high bandwidth and large storage requirements please contact us for details what constraints exist on websites domain names or email for plans or packages featuring unlimited websites domains or email accounts we do not enforce any official limitations customers are able to utilize as many of these features as they wish that said these are of course not infinite resources and there are inherent maximums associated with the technology powering them for example while email account creation is unlimited these rely on the file storage available on the account therefore customers need to be operating within the terms of service to ensure resources are available to fully enable email functionality customers operating within the terms of service have yet to come up against technical boundaries for email domains or websites × managed support all vps and dedicated servers on bluehost include managed support from our hosting experts features of managed support include
