also high on its quantum logic technology which it says will solve one of the custom electronics industry’s biggest dilemmas the public’s almost universal embrace of compressed audio files augsburger recently spoke to ce pro about all that harman has in the works what impact will ieee  avb have on residential integration we’ve invested heavily over the past  years in networking components for us it was out of necessity because when you do a large stadium for example you have equipment rooms spread out and it’s a challenge to control all these components and monitor all the pieces remotely that drove us to put together the sdig systems development integration group about eight years ago and we started really focusing on control and monitoring we were moving data around with cobranet then about two years ago we got very involved in this avnu alliance up to that point we were able to move data over an ethernet cable we knew it was going to get there but we didn’t know the time it was going to get there you’d have all sorts of jitter problems what ethernet avb did for us was it solved that jitter problem and then it also allowed us to increase the bandwidth so we could move audio and video so that’s really how we’ve developed the pro side of the business what we want to do is take that technology and integrate it into this cedia type business we see a lot of opportunity in the residential side and the office side i think we have the expertise from our professional side and it’s all about creating a value solution it’s got to be easy to use nowadays when you look at a professional system you’ve got engineers that work with contractors that have to do the programming and set it up we need to get over that hump so we’re trying to deal with that with ethernet avb wall panels so you can control the stuff and it’s an easy to use interface what does it mean for installers the key for us and i think the key for this business in general is that we have to simplify the installation today to do a crestron or amx system you have to be trained and constantly stay up on the training how do we simplify that whole process our goal at the end of the day is to make it easy to use plug and play that would mean guys integrators can lower their costs if you look at a contractor today on the professional side if he’s going to put in a system he’s got to have somebody on his staff who’s an expert at every component it’s the same thing for a residential installer if he’s going to put a system in he’s got to have somebody on his staff who knows everything if harman can bring a whole system solution and you have one guy on your staff that understands the whole thing and it all plugs and plays it saves them money the key takeaway point there is how do we make it easier to use and easier to install how do you see ieee  avb fitting in the market versus other existing cable networking solutions we’re ethernet guys that’s where we see the future and that’s where
