ts   risk factors there are important differences between the notes and a conventional debt security an investment in the notes involves significant risks including those listed below you should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the notes in the additional risk factors section below the risk factors section beginning on page p of the product supplement and the risks associated with foreign currency notes and indexed notes section beginning on page s of the prospectus supplement identified below under additional note terms as well as the explanation of certain risks related to sek contained in item  of our annual report on form f for the fiscal year ended december   which was filed with the sec on april   and is incorporated by reference herein we also urge you to consult your investment legal tax accounting and other advisers before you invest in the notes     §   your investment may result in a loss     §   your yield may be lower than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity     §   your return if any is limited to the return represented by the capped value     §   your investment return if any may be less than a comparable investment directly in copper as measured by the copper spot price     §   you must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment linked to the copper spot price     §   in seeking to provide you with what we believe to be commercially reasonable terms for the notes while providing merrill lynch with compensation for its services we have considered the costs of developing hedging and distributing the notes if a trading market develops for the notes and such a market may not develop these costs are expected to affect the market price you may receive or be quoted for your notes on a date prior to the stated maturity date merrill lynch is not obligated to make a market for or to repurchase the notes     §   many factors affect the trading value of the notes these factors interrelate in complex ways and the effect of any one factor may offset or magnify the effect of another factor     §   payments on the notes are subject to seks credit risk and changes to seks credit ratings are expected to affect the value of the notes     §   purchases and sales by merrill lynch and its affiliates may affect your return     §   ownership of notes will not entitle you to any rights with respect to copper or any related futures contracts or commodities     §   trading in copper can be volatile based on a number of factors that we cannot control     §   suspensions or disruptions of market trading in copper and related futures markets may adversely affect the value of the notes     §   the notes will not be regulated by the cftc     §   tax consequences are uncertain see summary tax consequences and certain us federal income taxation considerations below and certain us federal income taxation considerations beginning on page p of product supplement arn in addition to these risk factors it is important to bear in mind that the notes are senior debt securities of sek and are not guaranteed or insured by the fdic or secured by collateral nor are they obligations of or guaranteed by the kingdom of sweden the notes will rank equally with all of seks unsecured and unsubordinated debt and any payments due on the notes including any repayment of principal will be subject to the credit risk of sek additional risk factors there are risks associated with investing in copper or copperlinked notes the copper spot price is derived from an exchangetraded principals market specifically the london metal exchange the lme certain features of us futures markets are not present in the context of trading on the lme for example there are no daily price limits which would otherwise restrict the extent of daily fluctuations in the prices of the commodities in such markets in a declining market therefore it is possible that prices would continue to decline without limitation within a trading day or over a period of trading days copper prices are primarily responsive to global supply and demand key factors that may influence prices are the size and availability of copper stockpiles as well as economic conditions in the countries that are the principal consumers of copper including the united states and china copper is an excellent conductor of electricity as such one of its main industrial usage is for the production of cable wire and electrical products for both the electrical and building industries the construction industry also accounts for coppers second largest usage in such areas as pipes for plumbing heating and ventilating as well as building wire and sheet metal facings accordingly reduced demand in these and other industries in which copper is used could reduce the value of the notes the market value of the notes may be affected by price movements in distantdelivery futures contracts associated with the copper spot price the price movements in the copper spot price may not be reflected in the market value of the notes if you are able to sell your notes the price you receive could be affected by changes in the values of futures contracts on copper or similar underlying commodities that have more distant delivery dates than the spot price the prices for these distantdelivery futures contracts may not increase to the same extent as the prices of the copper spot price or may decrease to a greater extent which may adversely affect the value of the notes changes in the methodology used to calculate the copper spot price or changes in laws or regulations may affect the value of the notes the copper committee of the lme may make recommendations to the executive committee of the lme as to contract specifications trading procedures delivery points and policy issues related to the trading of copper contracts on the lme in a way that may adversely affect the copper spot price and the value of the notes the copper committee and the lme have no obligation to consider your interests the lme also may from   ts   time to time change any rule or bylaw or take emergency action under its rules any of which could affect the copper spot price any change of this kind could cause a decrease in the copper spot price which would adversely affect the value of the notes in addition the price of copper could be adversely affected by the promulgation of new laws or regulations or by the reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations including without limitation those relating to taxes and duties on commodities or commodity components by one or more governments governmental agencies or instrumentalities courts or other official bodies any event of this kind could adversely affect the copper spot price and as a result could adversely affect the value of the notes other terms of the notes the following definitions supersede and replace the definition of market disruption event set forth beginning on page p of product supplement arn market disruption event a market disruption event means any of the following events as determined in good faith by the calculation agent     a the suspension of or material limitation on trading in copper or futures contracts or options related to copper on the relevant market as defined below     b the failure of trading to commence or permanent discontinuance of trading in copper or futures contracts or options related to copper on the relevant market     c the failure of the lme as defined above to calculate or publish the official reference price of copper for that day or the information necessary for determining the official reference prices or     d any other event if the calculation agent determines in its sole discretion that the event materially interferes with our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to unwind all or a material portion of a hedge that we or our affiliates have effected or may effect as to the notes for the purpose of determining whether a market disruption event has occurred     a a limitation on the hours in a trading day andor number of days of trading will not constitute a market disruption event if it results from an announced change in the regular trading hours of the relevant market and     b a suspension of or material limitation on trading in the relevant market will not include any time when trading is not conducted or prices are not quoted by the lme in the relevant market under ordinary circumstances relevant market relevant market means the market in london on which members of the lme or any successor thereto quote prices for the buying and selling of copper or if such market is no longer the principal trading market for copper or options or futures contracts for copper such other exchange or principal trading market for copper as determined in good faith by the calculation agent which serves as the source of prices for copper and any principal exchanges where options or futures contracts on copper are traded     ts   investor considerations   you may wish to consider an investment in the notes if   §   you

consider the united states federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes including the following        we intend to take the position that the notes will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts to purchase copper and by purchasing a note you will be deemed to have agreed to that treatment        under the treatment agreed to above the gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and generally will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holder held the note more than one year immediately before the disposition you should refer to the product supplement related to this offering for additional information relating to us federal income tax and should consult your own tax advisors to determine tax consequences particular to your situation certain us federal income taxation considerations below is a summary of certain us federal income tax considerations for us investors us holders that are initial holders of the notes and that hold the notes as capital assets the following summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the discussions under the section entitled certain us federal income taxation considerations beginning on page p of the accompanying product supplement arn which you should carefully review prior to investing in the notes general     we intend to take the position that the notes will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts to purchase copper and by purchasing a note you will be deemed to have agreed to that treatment the remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will be so treated we also will take the position that at the time of issuance of your note you deposit irrevocably with us a fixed amount of cash equal to the purchase price of your note to assure the fulfillment of your purchase obligation which deposit will be noninterest bearing and will be unconditionally and irrevocably applied at the maturity date to satisfy that obligation at the maturity date although you will be obligated to treat the purchase price as a deposit for us federal income tax purposes the cash proceeds that we will receive from the offering will not be segregated by us during the term of your note but instead will be commingled with our other assets no statutory administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of holders of notes for us federal income tax purposes as a result no assurance can be given that the irs or a court will agree with the tax consequences described in this discussion a differing treatment from that assumed herein could adversely affect the amount timing and character of income gain or loss in respect of an investment in the notes prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the us federal income tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the notes in light of their own particular circumstances as well as the effect of any state local or foreign tax laws sale exchange or other taxable disposition of notes     a us holders initial tax basis in the notes should be the price at which the us holder purchased the notes upon the sale exchange or other disposition of notes in a taxable disposition a us holder should generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the proceeds received including amounts received at maturity and the us holders adjusted tax basis in the note under the treatment agreed to above the gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and generally will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holder held the note more than one year immediately before the disposition longterm capital gains of individuals are eligible for reduced rates of taxation the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations regulatory and legislative developments related to taxation of prepaid forward contracts     on december   the irs and us treasury department issued a notice requesting public comments on a comprehensive set of tax policy issues raised by prepaid forward contracts including several different approaches under which us holders of prepaid forward contracts could be required to recognize ordinary income on a current basis or could be treated as owning directly the assets subject to the prepaid forward contract although it is currently uncertain what future guidance will result from the notice the notice leaves open the possibility that such guidance could have retroactive application in addition prospective investors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors about the potential impact of several proposed legislative changes in the taxation of derivatives contracts and the likelihood that any of the foregoing may take effect it is also possible that future regulations or other irs guidance would require you to accrue income with respect to the notes on a current basis at ordinary rates as opposed to capital gains rates in excess of any amounts paid currently or to treat the notes in another manner that significantly differs from the agreedto treatment discussed above prospective purchasers of the notes should consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences in light of their particular circumstances under the laws of the united states and any other taxing

categories each designed to meet a different set of investor risk profiles time horizons income requirements and market views bullish bearish moderate outlook etc the following descriptions of these categories are meant solely for informational purposes and are not intended to represent any particular marketlinked investment or guarantee performance certain marketlinked investments may have overlapping characteristics market downside protection market downside protection marketlinked investments combine some of the capital preservation features of traditional bonds with the growth potential of equities and other asset classes they offer full or partial market downside protection at maturity while offering market exposure that may provide better returns than comparable fixed income securities it is important to note that the market downside protection feature provides investors with protection only at maturity subject to issuer credit risk in addition in exchange for full or partial protection you forfeit dividends and full exposure to the linked assets upside in some circumstances this could result in a lower return than with a direct investment in the asset enhanced income these short to mediumterm marketlinked notes offer you a way to enhance your income stream either though variable or fixedinterest coupons an added payout at maturity based on the performance of the linked asset or both in exchange for receiving current income you will generally forfeit upside potential on the linked asset even so the prospect of higher interest payments andor an additional payout may equate to a higher return potential than you may be able to find through other fixedincome securities enhanced income marketlinked investments generally do not include market downside protection the degree to which your principal is repaid at maturity is generally determined by the performance of the linked asset although enhanced income streams may help offset potential declines in the asset you can still lose part or all of your original investment market access market access notes may offer exposure to certain market sectors asset classes andor strategies that may not even be available through the other three categories of marketlinked investments subject to certain fees the returns on market access marketlinked investments will generally correspond on a onetoone basis with any increases or decreases in the value of the linked asset similar to a direct investment in some instances they may also provide interim coupon payments these investments do not include the market downside protection feature and therefore your principal remains at risk enhanced return these short to mediumterm investments offer you a way to enhance exposure to a particular market view without taking on a similarly enhanced level of market downside risk they can be especially effective in a flat to moderately positive market or in the case of bearish investments a flat to moderately negative market in exchange for the potential to receive betterthan market returns on the linked asset you must generally accept a degree of market downside risk and capped upside potential as these investments are not market downside protected and do not assure full repayment of principal at maturity you need to be prepared for the possibility that you may lose all or part of

supplement arn   the basket component indices   sp  index   the sp  index is published by standard  poor’s a division of the mcgraw hill companies inc “standard  poor’s” or “sp” the sp  index is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of common stock price movement in the united states the calculation of the level of the sp  index discussed below in further detail is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of  companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of  similar companies during the base period of the years  through  as of november    companies or  of the market capitalization of the sp  index traded on the new york stock exchange  companies or  of the market capitalization of the sp  index traded on the nasdaq stock market and no companies traded on the american stock exchange as of november   the aggregate market value of the  companies included in the sp  index represented approximately  of the aggregate market value of stocks included in the standard  poor’s stock guide database of domestic common stocks traded in the us excluding american depositary receipts limited partnerships and mutual funds standard  poor’s chooses companies for inclusion in the sp  index with the aim of achieving a distribution by broad industry groupings that approximates the distribution of these groupings in the common stock population of the standard  poor’s stock guide database which standard  poor’s uses as an assumed model for the composition of the total market relevant criteria employed by standard  poor’s include the viability of the particular company the extent to which that company represents the industry group to which it is assigned the extent to which the market price of that company’s common stock is generally responsive to changes in the affairs of the respective industry and the market value and trading activity of the common stock of that company ten main groups of companies comprise the sp  index with the approximate percentage of the market capitalization of the sp  index included in each group as of november   indicated in parentheses consumer discretionary  consumer staples  energy  financials  health care  industrials  information technology  materials  telecommunication services  and utilities  standard  poor’s may from time to time in its sole discretion add companies to or delete companies from the sp  index to achieve the objectives stated above   the sp  index does not reflect the payment of dividends on the stocks included in the sp  index because of this the calculation of the ending value will not reflect the payment of dividends on these stocks that investors would receive if they were to purchase these stocks and hold them for a period equal to the term of the notes   the following graph sets forth the historical performance of the sp  index in the period from february  through november  this historical data on the sp  index is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the sp  index or what the value of the notes may be any historical upward or downward trend in the level of the sp  index during any period set forth below is not an indication that the sp  index is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time over the term of the notes on december   the closing level of the sp  index was       all disclosure contained in this term sheet regarding the sp  index including without limitation its markup method of calculation and changes in its components has been derived from publicly available information prepared by standard  poor’s a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc “standard  poor’s” or “sp” sek and mlpfs have not independently verified and make no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of such information none of sek the calculation agent and mlpfs accepts any responsibility for the calculation maintenance or publication of the sp  index or any successor index   computation of the sp  index   while sp currently employs the following methodology to calculate the sp  index no assurance can be given that sp will not modify or change this methodology in a manner that may affect the amount an investor receives on the maturity date of the notes   historically the market value of any underlying stocks included in the sp  index was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of the then outstanding shares of that underlying stock in march  sp began shifting the sp  index half way from a market capitalization weighted formula to a floatadjusted formula before moving the sp  index to full float adjustment on september   sp’s criteria for selecting stocks for the sp  index did not change by the shift to float adjustment however the adjustment affects each company’s weight in the sp  index ie its market value   under float adjustment the share counts used in calculating the sp  index reflect only those shares that are available to investors not all of a company’s outstanding shares standard and poor’s defines three groups of shareholders whose holdings are subject to float adjustment   ·                       holdings by other publicly traded corporations venture capital firms private equity firms strategic partners or leveraged buyout groups   ·                       holdings by government entities including all levels of government in the united states or foreign countries and   ·                       holdings by current or former officers and directors of the company founders of the company or family trusts of officers directors or founders as well as holdings of trusts foundations pension funds employee stock ownership plans or other investment vehicles associated with and controlled by the company   however treasury stock stock options restricted shares equity participation units warrants preferred stock convertible stock and rights are not part of the float in cases where holdings in a group exceed  of the outstanding shares of a company the holdings of that group are excluded from the floatadjusted count of shares to be used in the sp  index calculation shares held by mutual funds investment advisory firms pension funds or foundations not associated with the company and investment funds in insurance companies shares of a united states company traded in canada as “exchangeable shares” shares that trust beneficiaries may buy or sell without difficulty or significant additional expense beyond typical brokerage fees and if a company has multiple classes of stock outstanding shares in an unlisted or nontraded class if such shares are convertible by shareholders without undue delay and cost are also part of the float   for each stock an investable weight factor“iwf” is calculated by dividing x the available float shares defined as the total shares outstanding less shares held in one or more of the three groups listed above where the group holdings exceed  of the outstanding shares by y the total shares outstanding the floatadjusted index is then calculated by dividing w the sum of the iwf multiplied by both the price and the total shares outstanding for each stock by z the index divisor for companies with multiple classes of stock standard  poor’s calculates the weighted average iwf for each stock using the proportion of the total company market capitalization of each share class as weights   the sp  index is calculated using a baseweighted aggregate methodology the level of the sp  index reflects the total market value of all  component stocks relative to the base period of the years  through  the “base period” an indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the value easier to work with and track over time the actual total market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years  through  has been set an indexed value of  this is often indicated by the notation    in practice the      daily calculation of the sp  index is computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the “index divisor” by itself the index divisor is an arbitrary number however in the context of the calculation of the sp  index it serves as a link to the original base period level of the sp  index the index divisor keeps the sp  index comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the sp  index   sp  index maintenance   sp  index maintenance includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions share changes stock splits stock dividends and stock price adjustments due to company restructuring or spinoffs   to prevent the level of the sp  index from changing due to these corporate actions all corporate actions which affect the level of the sp  index require an index divisor adjustment by adjusting the index divisor for the change in total market value of an individual company the level of the sp  index remains constant this helps maintain the level of the sp  index as an accurate barometer of stock market performance and ensures that the movement of the sp  index is not caused by the corporate action of an individual company all index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the sp  index closing level   some corporate actions such as stock splits and stock dividends require simple changes in the common shares outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the sp  index and do not require divisor adjustments   changes in a company’s shares outstanding of  or more due to mergers acquisitions public offerings private placements tender offers dutch auctions or exchange offers are made as soon as reasonably possible all other changes of  or more due to for example company stock repurchases redemptions exercise of options warrants subscription rights conversion of preferred stock notes debt equity participation units or other recapitalizations are made weekly and are announced on tuesday for implementation after the close of trading on wednesday changes of less than  are accumulated and made quarterly on the third friday of march june september and december and are usually announced two days prior   also changes in iwfs of more than ten percentage points caused by corporate actions such as merger and acquisition activity restructurings or spinoffs will be made as soon as reasonably possible other changes in iwfs will be made annually in september when iwfs are reviewed

price performance of selected japanese stocks the nikkei  index is currently comprised of  stocks that trade on the tokyo stock exchange the “tse” and represents a broad crosssection of japanese industry all  of the stocks underlying the nikkei  index the “underlying stocks” are stocks listed in the first section of the tse stocks listed in the first section are among the most actively traded stocks on the tse nikkei calculates the nikkei  index by multiplying the per share price of each underlying stock by the corresponding weighting factor for that nikkei  underlying stock calculating the sum of all these products and dividing that sum by a divisor as of october   the divisor was  and is subject to periodic adjustments futures and options contracts on the nikkei  index are traded on the singapore international monetary exchange the osaka securities exchange and the chicago mercantile exchange   the following graph sets forth the historical performance of the nikkei  index in the period from february  through november  this historical data on the nikkei  index is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the nikkei  index or what the value of the notes may be any historical upward or downward trend in the level of the nikkei  index during any period set forth below is not an indication that the nikkei  index is more or less likely to increase or decrease

information none of sek the calculation agent and mlpfs accepts any responsibility for the calculation maintenance or publication of the nikkei  index or any successor index   the nikkei  index is a modified priceweighted index each stock’s weight in the nikkei  index is based on its price per share rather than the total market capitalization of the issuer nikkei calculates the nikkei  index by multiplying the per share price of each underlying stock by the corresponding weighting factor for that nikkei  underlying stock a “weight factor” calculating the sum of all these products and dividing that sum by a divisor the divisor initially set on may   at  was  as of october   and is subject to periodic adjustments as set forth below each weight factor is computed by dividing ¥ by the par value of the relevant nikkei  underlying stock so that the share price of each nikkei  underlying stock when multiplied by its weight factor corresponds to a share price based on a uniform par value of ¥ each weight factor represents the number of shares of the related nikkei  underlying stock which are included in one trading unit of the nikkei  index the stock prices used in the calculation of the nikkei  index are those reported by a primary market for the nikkei  underlying stocks which is currently the tse the level of the nikkei  index is calculated once per minute during tse trading hours   in order to maintain continuity in the level of the nikkei  index in the event of certain changes due to nonmarket factors affecting the nikkei  underlying stocks such as the addition or deletion of stocks substitution of stocks stock dividends stock splits or distributions of assets to stockholders the divisor used in calculating the nikkei  index is adjusted in a manner designed to prevent any instantaneous change or discontinuity in the level of the nikkei  index the divisor remains at the new value until a further adjustment is necessary as the result of another change as a result of each change affecting any nikkei  underlying stock the divisor is adjusted in such a way that the sum of all share prices immediately after the change multiplied by the applicable weight factor and divided by the new divisor i e the level of the nikkei  index immediately after the change will equal the level of the nikkei  index immediately prior to the change   the nikkei  underlying stocks may be deleted or added by nikkei however to maintain continuity in the nikkei  index the policy of nikkei is generally not to alter the composition of the nikkei  underlying stocks except when an underlying stock is deleted in accordance with the following criteria any stock becoming ineligible for listing in the first section of the tse due to any of the following reasons will be deleted from the nikkei  underlying stocks bankruptcy of the issuer merger of the issuer into or acquisition of the issuer by another company delisting of the stock or transfer of the stock to the “seiripost” because of excess debt of the issuer or because of any other reason or transfer of the stock to the second section of the tse upon deletion of a stock from the nikkei  index nikkei will select in accordance with certain criteria established by it a replacement for the deleted underlying stock in an exceptional case a newly listed stock in the first section of the tse that is recognized by nikkei to be representative of a market may be added to the nikkei  underlying stocks as a result an existing underlying stock with low trading volume and not representative of a market will be deleted   none of sek mlpfs and nikkei accepts any responsibility for the calculation maintenance or publication of the nikkei  index or any successor index nikkei disclaims all responsibility for any errors or omissions in the calculation and dissemination of the nikkei  index or the manner in which the nikkei  index is applied in determining any starting value or ending

capitalization trading hours are currently from  am to  am and from  pm to  pm tokyo time monday through friday      due to the time zone difference on any normal trading day the tse will close prior to the opening of business in new york city on the same calendar day therefore the closing level of the nikkei  index on a trading day will generally be available in the united states by the opening of business on the same calendar day   the tse has adopted certain measures including daily price floors and ceilings on individual stocks intended to prevent any extreme shortterm price fluctuations resulting from order imbalances in general any stock listed on the tse cannot be traded at a price lower than the applicable price floor or higher than the applicable price ceiling these price floors and ceilings are expressed in absolute japanese yen rather than percentage limits based on the closing price of the stock on the previous trading day in addition when there is a major order imbalance in a listed stock the tse posts a “special bid quote” or a “special asked quote” for that stock at a specified higher or lower price level than the stock’s last sale price in order to solicit counterorders and balance supply and demand for the stock prospective investors should also be aware that the tse may suspend the trading of individual stocks in certain limited and extraordinary circumstances including for example unusual trading activity in that stock as a result changes in the nikkei  index may be limited by price limitations or special quotes or by suspension of trading on individual stocks which comprise the nikkei  index and these limitations may in turn adversely affect the value of the notes   license agreement   nikkei and sek have entered into or to the extent required will enter into a nonexclusive license agreement providing for the license to sek in exchange for a fee of a right to use indices owned and published by nikkei in connection with some

our history we have supported the swedish export industry with financing for over  years sek was founded jointly by the swedish government and major swedish banks in  but since  sek has been wholly owned by the swedish government the postwar years new need for financing industrial competition increased following the restoration of europe’s production capabilities after the second world war buyers’ demanded increasingly generous terms of credit which became a burden for swedish industry and the banking sector couldn’t cope so sweden’s commercial banks wanted to establish an export finance institution with statefunded guarantees  sek is founded when it was formed in  the swedish export credit corporation sek was jointly owned by the swedish government and the commercial banks our very first transaction was the financing of the cargo ship ms berit which was built at finnboda shipyard in  for export to the åland islands the s and s lending gets easier sek made a number of changes in the s that made it easier to lend to the export sector this allowed more swedish exporters to access loans and become more competitive the s were a period of uncertainty around the world and the oil crisis and economic conditions in both oecd nations and developing countries created new demands for lending most credit institutions around the world were forced to offer borrowers more generous terms this led to a raft of international agreements on lending between  and    sek facts  saw the introduction of the statefunded swedish credit system since  sek has been wholly owned by
