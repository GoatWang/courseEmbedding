management llc the “investment adviser” to enable the investment adviser to serve as the investment adviser for the barrett opportunity fund inc the “fund”  this document includes a notice of special meeting of shareholders a proxy statement and a proxy card  at a meeting of the fund’s board of directors the “board” held on february   the board voted to approve the investment advisory agreement and to recommend that it be submitted to the fund’s shareholders for approval what am i being asked to vote on you are being asked to vote to approve the investment advisory agreement between the investment adviser and the fund  the proposal relates to a change in the investment adviser to the fund  the fund is currently managed by barrett associates inc the “existing manager” a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of legg mason inc “legg mason”  in a transaction that is expected to close on march   or as soon as practicable thereafter the investment adviser a newlyformed investment advisory firm owned by certain of the existing manager’s principal employees has entered into an agreement with legg mason to acquire substantially all of the property and assets and to assume certain of the liabilities of the existing manager the “transaction”  under the federal securities laws in order for the investment adviser to succeed the existing manager as the fund’s investment adviser the fund’s shareholders must approve the investment advisory agreement if the fund’s shareholders do not approve the investment advisory agreement then the board will have to consider other alternatives for the fund including upon termination of the present investment advisory agreement entering into an interim investment advisory agreement with the investment adviser pursuant to rule a under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” pursuant to which the fund would have  days to obtain shareholder approval of a permanent agreement how will the approval of the proposal to approve the investment advisory agreement affect the management and operation of the fund the persons responsible for managing the fund’s assets are not expected to change as a result of the transaction  in particular robert j milnamow and e wells beck cfa will continue to be the fund’s portfolio managers as members of the new investment adviser’s management team  in addition the other members of the management team responsible for operating the investment adviser will be substantially the same as the management team that is currently responsible for operating the existing manager in connection with the transaction it is expected that the fund will enter into new service provider arrangements for noninvestment advisory services with various affiliates of us bancorp  in particular the fund will enter into separate agreements with us bancorp fund services llc “usbfs” under which usbfs will serve as the fund’s administrator fund accountant and transfer agent respectively  the fund will also enter into separate agreements with us bank national association and quasar distributors llc affiliates of usbfs for custody and distribution services respectively  in addition the fund will appoint cohen fund audit services to replace kpmg llp as the fund’s independent auditor  these changes to the fund’s noninvestment advisory service arrangements do not need to be separately approved by the fund’s shareholders     qa            how will the approval of the proposal affect the expenses of the fund the investment adviser has agreed to reduce the management fee that it would receive from the fund under the proposed new investment advisory agreement by  basis points  in addition the investment adviser has agreed to voluntarily waive an additional  basis points of its advisory fee for a period of one year following the transaction  these reductions in the advisory fee will be largely offset by an expected increase in the administrative and other fees payable by the fund for noninvestment advisory services  however the fund’s total operating expenses under the new service provider arrangements are expected to decrease slightly what are the primary reasons for the selection of the investment adviser as the investment adviser of the fund in determining to approve the proposed investment advisory agreement the board principally considered the need to provide for continuity of investment advisory serves to the fund following the transaction  the board also weighed a number of other factors including the history and reputation of the existing manager the qualifications and resources of the investment adviser and the fact that the existing manager’s current portfolio managers would continue to provide the daytoday management of the fund  the board also considered the fact that the investment adviser would no longer be part of the larger legg mason organization and the potential impact of the proposed changes on the fund’s operating expenses are there any material differences between the existing management contract and the proposed investment advisory agreement under the existing management contract the existing manager is responsible for managing the fund’s portfolio and for performing such administrative and other services as are necessary for the operation of the fund as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the fund  the existing manager is compensated for these noninvestment advisory services through the management fee that is paid by the fund under the existing management contract under the fund’s new service provider arrangements with us bancorp responsibility for these administrative and other services will be assumed by usbfs  consequently under the investment advisory agreement the investment adviser will not perform administrative services for the fund  the advisory fee payable under the proposed new investment advisory agreement has been reduced from the management fee payable under the existing management contract to reflect this change in service provider arrangements  in addition the investment adviser has agreed to waive an additional portion of its management fee for a period of one year following the transaction  as noted above these reductions in the advisory fee will be largely offset by an expected increase in the administrative and other fees payable by the fund for noninvestment advisory services there are other differences between the existing management contract and the proposed investment advisory agreement which are summarized in the proxy statement has the board approved the proposal yes  the board has approved the proposal set forth herein and recommends that shareholders also vote to approve the proposal  as noted herein members of the board and their families own a

who also provide brokerage and research services as those terms are defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “securities exchange act” to the fund andor the other accounts over which the adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion a practice commonly referred to as “soft dollars”  the adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the fund which is in excess of the amount of commission or spread another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer  this determination may be viewed either in terms of that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities that the adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts

transactions  the adviser will continue to provide substantially similar services to the fund under the proposed investment advisory agreement   the existing management contract further provides that

advisory agreement with lmpfa or any other service provider under the investment advisory agreement  instead following the closing of the transaction the fund will enter into separate agreements with usbfs under which usbfs will serve as the fund’s administrator and fund accountant  the fees associated with these service provider arrangements with us bancorp will be paid for by the fund  under the existing management contract these fees were paid for by the adviser  as noted above the advisory fee under the investment advisory agreement has been reduced to reflect this change in service provider arrangements   payment of expenses   the existing management contract requires the adviser to bear all expenses and to furnish all necessary services facilities and personnel in connection with its responsibilities to provide the fund with investment advisory and administrative services  except for these expenses the adviser is not responsible for the fund’s expenses  the adviser will have substantially similar responsibility for payment of expenses under the proposed investment advisory agreement except that this obligation will be limited to expenses that relate to the adviser’s obligation to provide investmentrelated services to the fund and will not extend to the administrative and other noninvestment related services that will be provided by the us bancorp service providers the proposed new investment advisory agreement expressly authorizes the investment adviser to voluntarily reduce any portion of the compensation or reimbursement of expenses due to it and to

expense limitation shall be reimbursed by the fund to the investment adviser in the three fiscal years following the fiscal year of the withholding reduction or payment so long as the aggregate expenses during this period do not exceed any limitation to which the investment adviser has agreed  the existing management contract does not contain similar provisions allowing for the voluntary waiver of compensation or reimbursement of fund expenses     proxy statement           conflicts of interest   the existing management contract contains several provisions that address potential conflicts of interest that may arise in a typical investment advisory relationship in addition to those provisions discussed above the existing management contract provides that the adviser may not deal with itself or with members of the fund’s board or any principal underwriter of the fund as principals or agents in making purchases or sales of securities or other property for the fund nor may the adviser purchase any securities from an underwriting or selling group in which the adviser or its affiliates is participating or arrange for purchases and sales of securities between the fund and another account advised by the adviser or its affiliates except in each case as permitted under the  act and in accordance with such policies and procedures as may be adopted by the fund from time to time  the existing management contract specifically provides that personnel of the adviser even if serving the fund as a director officer or employee may nonetheless engage in any other business or devote his or her time and attention in part to the management or other aspects of any other business whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature  in addition the adviser may engage in any other business or render services of any kind including investment advisory and management services to any other fund firm individual or association  the existing management contract also provides that if the purchase or sale of securities consistent with the investment policies of the fund or one or more other accounts of the adviser are considered at or about the same time transactions in such securities must be allocated among the accounts in a manner deemed equitable by the adviser  such allocations would be made in accordance with the adviser’s policies and procedures as presented to the board from time to time which policies and procedures generally require the allocation of investment opportunities among mutual funds and individual client accounts on a pro rata basis according to their asset size  in addition if transactions of the fund and another client are combined as permitted by applicable laws and regulations such transactions must also be consistent with the adviser’s policies and procedures as presented to the board from time to time  the investment advisory agreement does not contain similar provisions to address potential conflicts of interest   limitation on liability   under the existing management contract the adviser assumes no responsibility other than to render the services called for by the agreement in good faith and the adviser is not liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss arising out of any investment or for any act or omission in the execution of securities transactions for the fund  the adviser is not protected however from losses arising out of the willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the existing management contract  the existing management contract does not provide for the fund’s indemnification of or advancement of expenses to the adviser  the adviser will be subject to substantially identical terms under the proposed investment advisory agreement term and continuance   the existing management contract had an initial twoyear term and is eligible to be continued thereafter for successive oneyear periods only if such continuance is specifically approved at least annually in the manner required by the  act  if approved by shareholders of the fund the proposed investment advisory agreement has an initial term of oneyear subject to the termination provisions summarized below  thereafter the proposed investment advisory agreement may be renewed only so long as such renewal and continuance is specifically approved at least annually a by the board or b by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the fund provided that in either event the continuance is also approved by a majority of the board members who are not interested persons of a party to the investment advisory agreement termination  the existing management contract provides that the contract may be terminated at any time without the payment of any penalty by the fund upon not more than  days’ and not less than  days’ written notice to the adviser or by the adviser upon not less than  days’ written notice to the fund  the proposed investment advisory agreement may be terminated by the fund at any time on  days’ written notice to the investment adviser  the adviser may terminate the investment advisory agreement on  days’ written notice to the fund  both the existing management contract and the proposed investment advisory agreement provide that the fund may effect termination by action of the board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the fund accompanied by appropriate notice  each of the existing management contract and the investment advisory agreement terminates automatically in the event of its “assignment” as defined in the  act     proxy statement           board recommendation of approval in reaching its decision to recommend the approval by fund shareholders of the proposed new investment advisory agreement with the investment adviser the board including a majority of its members the “independent directors” who are not considered to be “interested persons” under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” met in person at a special meeting of the board held on february   the “special meeting”  to assist the board in its consideration of the proposed new investment advisory agreement the existing manager and its affiliates provided a variety of information to the board about the investment adviser as well as the new investment advisory and other service provider arrangements being proposed for the fund certain portions of which are discussed below  the board also received and considered a variety of information relating to the existing manager’s management of the fund at a regularly scheduled meeting held on december   the “december meeting” where among other things the board considered and approved the renewal of the fund’s existing agreement with the existing manager for an additional term of one year  at the december meeting the investment manager informed the board of the transaction and indicated it would seek the board’s approval of the proposed new investment advisory agreement at a special meeting  the information provided to the board relating to the renewal of the existing agreement at the december meeting together with the information provided to the board at the special meeting is referred to in this section as the “contract approval information”   in addition to the contract approval information the board received performance and other information throughout the year relating to the fund’s operations and the services provided to it by the existing manager and its affiliates  the board’s evaluation of the new investment advisory agreement took into account the information received throughout the year and also reflected the knowledge and familiarity gained as board members of the fund with respect to the services provided to the fund by the existing manager  for purposes of this section the term “adviser” refers to both the existing manager and the new investment adviser   in its deliberations regarding the approval of the new investment advisory agreement the board considered each of the factors below   nature extent and quality of the investment advisory services provided to the fund   the board received and considered the contract approval information regarding the nature extent and quality of the investment advisory and other services provided to the fund by the existing manager and its affiliates during the past year  the board also considered the potential impact the transaction might have on the investment adviser’s ability to continue to support the fund including the financial resources that would be available to the adviser   the board reviewed the qualifications backgrounds and responsibilities of the adviser’s senior personnel and the portfolio management team primarily responsible for the daytoday management of the fund’s portfolio and the proposed compliance programs for the new investment adviser and the fund subsequent to completion of the transaction  prior to the special meeting the board expressed its concern regarding the financial resources of the new investment adviser  in this regard it was noted that prior to the transaction the existing manager has had access to the financial resources of legg mason  its ultimate corporate parent——to support its activities in respect of the fund  while those resources would no longer be available to the investment adviser following the transaction the investment adviser noted that it expected to retain nearly all of its clients and as a result it expected that it would have sufficient revenues personnel and other resources to support the fund  moreover the board considered a summary provided by the adviser of the the terms of the asset purchase agreement between the investment adviser and legg mason including the consideration that the investment adviser has agreed to pay legg mason  the board noted that as part of this consideration the investment adviser has agreed make payments to legg mason for a period of time based on a share of its revenues from its investment advisory activities including its advisory activities in respect of the fund  however the board was advised that the financial terms under the contemplated arrangements would be more advantageous to the investment adviser than is presently the case under the existing manager’s current relationship with legg mason potentially increasing the investment adviser’s ability to reinvest in its business following the transaction  the board considered the belief expressed by the investment adviser that it would have sufficient revenues and other financial resources to support its activities in respect of the fund     proxy statement             the board noted that administrative and other nonadvisory services required for the fund’s operations provided by the existing manager and its affiliates under the management agreement would not be provided under the new investment advisory agreement and that following completion of the transaction those services would be provided by us bancorp and its affiliates under various new service provider arrangements with the fund  the cost of the administrative services currently provided under the management agreement will be borne by the fund under new agreements with usbfs but the board noted that these fees would be offset by the reductions and waivers in the advisory fee being proposed by the investment adviser  the board considered the belief expressed by the investment adviser that the quality of the services received by the fund under the new service provider arrangements would be equal to or better than the quality of nonadvisory services currently received by the fund under the management agreement  the board also noted that us bancorp is a substantial financial institution with significant financial resources   the board concluded that overall the expected nature extent and quality of the investment advisory services to be provided to the fund under the new investment advisory agreement would be adequate under the circumstances   fund performance    at the december meeting the board received and considered performance information and analyses the “lipper performance information” for the fund as well as for a group of funds the “performance universe” selected by lipper inc “lipper” an independent provider of investment company data  the board was provided with a description of the methodology lipper used to determine the similarity of the fund with the funds included in the performance universe  the performance universe consisted of the fund and all retail and institutional large cap value funds as classified by lipper regardless of asset size or primary channel of distribution   the lipper performance information comparing the fund’s performance to that of the performance universe based on net asset value per share showed among other things that the fund’s performance ranked in the fourth quintile of funds in the performance universe for the   and  year periods ended september   and in the fifth quintile of funds in the performance universe for the year period ended september    at its december meeting the board considered the adviser’s explanations for the fund’s relative underperformance for the   and year periods that the fund’s overweighting in the financial services sector and underweighting in the technology sector had negative impacts on fund investment results  the board also considered the fund’s performance in relation to its benchmark and in absolute terms  in evaluating the fund’s performance the board noted the adverse market conditions during  and early  and the fact that the fund’s investment portfolio is managed in a taxaware manner   at the special meeting the board received and considered updated information relating to the fund’s performance as of january   which showed a slight improvement in the fund’s performance over the limited period of time covered   based on its review of the fund’s performance and all of the other factors noted above including the need to provide for continuation of investment advisory services and other services required for operation of the fund to the fund following completion of the transaction the board concluded that under the circumstances the fund’s performance supported approval of the new investment advisory agreement     proxy statement             investment advisory fees and expense ratios    the board reviewed and considered the advisory fee the “advisory fee” proposed to be paid by the fund to the investment adviser under the new investment advisory agreement in light of the nature extent and quality of investment advisory services provided by the adviser under the existing management agreement and expected to be provided to the fund under the new investment advisory agreement   at its december meeting the board received and considered information and analyses prepared as of september   by lipper the “lipper expense information” comparing the management fee paid by the fund under the existing management contract the “management fee” and the fund’s overall expenses for the fund’s latest fiscal year with those of the funds in the expense universe the “expense group” selected and provided by lipper  the comparison was based upon the constituent funds’ latest fiscal years  the expense group consisted of the fund and ten other retail noload large cap value funds as classified by lipper  the eleven funds in the expense group had average net assets ranging from  million to  million  six of the expense group funds were larger than the fund and four were smaller   the lipper expense information comparing the management fee as well as the fund’s actual total expenses to the fund’s expense group showed that the fund’s contractual management fee was ranked fourth among the funds in the expense group  the lipper expense information also showed that the fund’s actual management fee ie after giving effect to any voluntary fee waivers implemented by managers of the other expense group funds was ranked seventh among the funds in the expense group slightly higher than the median for the expense group  the board noted that the proposed advisory fee under the new investment advisory agreement will be  basis points lower than the management fee and that at the request of the board the investment adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive an additional  basis points of its advisory fee for a period of one year following the transaction but that the management fee also has encompassed administrative and other noninvestment advisory services required for the fund’s operations that will not be encompassed by the advisory fee   at the december meeting the board also reviewed information regarding fees charged by the adviser to other us clients investing primarily in an asset class similar to that of the fund including where applicable separate accounts  the board was advised that while the fees paid by the adviser’s clients for separate account advisory services are on average lower than the management fee and the proposed advisory fee the fees charged to other clients range from higher to lower than the management fee and the proposed advisory fee depending among other factors on the assets under management in the account  the information discussed the significant differences in scope of services provided to the fund and to these other clients noting that the fund under the new advisory agreement will be provided with office facilities and fund officers including the fund’s chief executive chief financial and chief compliance officers and that the adviser will coordinate and oversee the provision of services to the fund by other fund service providers  the board considered the fee comparisons in light of the differences required to manage these different types of accounts  the board also was advised in response to its inquiry at the special meeting that the advisory fees charged to the adviser’s only other mutual fund client are higher than the proposed advisory fee but also include an expense limitation agreement  the adviser advised the board that under the circumstances it would not be able to agree to provide similar expense limitations to the fund   the lipper expense information presented to the board at the december meeting showed that the fund’s actual total expenses ranked sixth among the funds in the expense group  in explaining the fund’s actual total expenses the adviser noted that certain nonasset based expenses represented and may continue to represent a higher percentage of total average annual assets because of recent declines in the fund’s asset level  the board also noted that the small number of funds in the expense group which included funds varying widely in size made meaningful comparisons difficult   the board identified fund expenses as another particular area of concern prior to the special meeting  at the special meeting and in later supplemental information the board received and considered financial projections the “financial projections” estimating the fund’s annual operating expenses following the transaction after taking into account the reduced advisory fee under the proposed new investment advisory agreement the estimated fees that would be charged to the fund for noninvestment advisory services under the first year of the fund’s new service provider arrangement with us bancorp and certain other changes to the fund’s expense structure that would result from the fund no longer being a part of the larger legg mason funds complex  comparative information relating to the fund’s operating expenses for the past three fiscal years also was provided to the board based on assets at august    the board noted that the adviser was proposing a  basis point reduction in the advisory fee but that the financial projections showed that the fund’s total operating expenses would be approximately  basis points higher than the fund’s current operating expenses after giving effect to that reduction  the board also noted that the fund’s total operating expenses for the prior year ended august   had been higher than shown in the financial projections the board expressed concerns with the projected increase in the fund’s total operating expenses shown in the financial projections and after further discussions the adviser agreed to voluntarily waive an additional  basis points of its advisory fee for a period of one year following the transaction  the board also determined that the new investment advisory agreement should extend for a period of one year rather than two years as proposed by the investment adviser and permitted by law to provide an opportunity for the board to monitor expenses actually incurred by the fund following completion of the transaction and to consider any available and appropriate actions if actual expenses are significantly greater than projected at the special meeting     proxy statement            taking all of the above into consideration the board determined that the proposed advisory fee was acceptable under the circumstances including most importantly the need to provide continuation of investment advisory and other services required for the fund’s operations following completion of the transaction   adviser profitability    at the december meeting the board received an analysis of the profitability of the adviser and its affiliates in providing services to the fund under the existing management agreement  the board also received profitability information with respect to the legg mason fund complex as a whole  in addition the board received information with respect to the revenue and cost allocation methodologies used in preparing such profitability data  the adviser noted that its methodologies were reviewed by an outside consultant in  and the board was assured at the december meeting that there had been no significant changes in these methodologies since the report was rendered  the profitability analysis presented to the board at its december meeting indicated that the arrangements for providing advisory administrative and other nonadvisory services to the fund pursuant to the existing management contract were unprofitable to the existing manager and its affiliates taken as a whole  at the december meeting the existing manager acknowledged that the arrangements for providing advisory services only to the fund were profitable to the existing manager as a standalone entity   at the special meeting the board received and considered a pro forma profitability study analyzing how the profitability study provided to the board in december would change as a result of the proposed changes to the fund’s expense structure  the board noted that the results of this analysis showed that the adviser would realize a profit from managing the fund under the proposed new expense structure  the investment adviser noted that its profitability under the new investment advisory agreement will be derived only from investment advisory services provided to the fund while the profitability information presented to the board at the december meeting reflected profitability to the existing manager and its affiliates from providing not only investment advisory services but administrative and other nonadvisory services encompassed by the existing agreement  the board noted that responsibility for the costs of administrative and all other nonadvisory services provided to the fund pursuant to the management agreement will be borne directly by the fund following completion of the transaction pursuant to arrangements between the fund and new service providers but that these costs would be offset by the reductions and waivers in the advisory fee being proposed by the adviser  in response to questions from the board the adviser advised the board that although information regarding its own pretransaction profitability from providing investment advisory services under the existing management contract was not available it would expect that its own profitability under the proposed investment advisory agreement after the transaction would likely be somewhat less than its profitability as a stand alone entity under the existing management contract   the board concluded that the profit margin that the pro forma profitability study suggested that the adviser would receive under the new investment advisory agreement was not excessive under the circumstances     proxy statement             economies of scale    the board received and discussed contract approval information concerning whether the adviser will realize economies of scale if the fund’s assets grow  it was noted that the assets of the funds have generally declined in recent years and that because of limited marketability and distribution efforts any future increase in assets likely will result from appreciation of the fund’s investment portfolio rather than sales of additional fund shares  the board noted that according to the contract approval information the fund’s contractual management fee and actual management fee were ranked in the second and third quintiles of funds in the fund’s expense group in the lipper expense information respectively  in addition the board noted that there are reductions in fees at higher fund asset levels—or “breakpoints”—built into the new investment advisory agreement’s fee schedule should the assets of the fund grow  the board determined that the proposed advisory fee structure was appropriate under the present circumstances   other benefits to the manager    the board considered other benefits received by the adviser as a result of its relationship with the fund including the opportunity to obtain research services from brokers who effect fund portfolio transactions but did not regard such benefits as excessive  the board also considered the potential benefits that the investment adviser and legg mason may realize from approval of the new investment advisory agreement and completion of the transaction   other alternatives to the new investment advisory agreement    the board considered the uncertainty that investment advisory arrangements for a single relatively small fund like the fund would be available other than the proposed investment advisory arrangements with the adviser and considered the disruptive effects to the fund of a discontinuance of investment advisory and other services required for the fund’s operations after completion of the transaction  the board was advised by the existing manager at the december meeting that it wished to continue to manage the fund’s assets following the transaction and that it was unlikely that any other affiliates of legg mason would consider providing the services received by the fund under the existing management contract  the board also considered liquidation of the fund but concluded that liquidation would result in significant tax consequences—taxable realized capital gains—to many investors including those who otherwise would have elected to continue their investments in the fund and that liquidation under the fund’s circumstances would not be in the interests of shareholders           in light of all of the foregoing and other relevant factors including most importantly the need to provide for continuation of investment advisory and other services required for the fund’s operations after completion of the transaction and the fee reductions being proposed by the adviser the board determined that under the circumstances approval of the new investment advisory agreement for an initial period not to exceed one year would be consistent with the best interests of the fund and its shareholders and voted to approve the new investment advisory agreement and to recommend that it be approved by the fund’s shareholders   the principal factor identified by the board in determining whether to approve the new investment advisory agreement was a need to provide for continuation of investment advisory and other services required for the fund’s operations following completion of the transaction  no other single factor reviewed by the board was identified by the board as a principal factor in determining whether to approve the new investment advisory agreement and each board member attributed different weights to the various other factors  the independent directors were advised by separate independent counsel throughout the process  prior to the special meeting the independent directors received a memorandum discussing their responsibilities in connection with the proposed approval of the new investment advisory agreement from their independent counsel which was supplemented by his advice and guidance at the special meeting  prior to voting the independent directors also discussed the proposed approval of the new investment advisory agreement in private sessions with their independent legal counsel at which no representatives of the adviser or legg mason were present     proxy statement             vote required approval of the proposal to approve the investment advisory agreement in order to engage the investment adviser as the investment adviser for the fund requires the vote of the “majority of the outstanding voting securities” of the fund  under the  act a “majority of the outstanding voting securities” is defined as the lesser of   or more of the voting securities of the fund entitled to vote present in person or by proxy at the special meeting if the holders of more than  of the outstanding voting securities entitled to vote thereon are present in person or represented by proxy or  more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the fund entitled to vote thereon based on all of the foregoing the directors recommend that shareholders of the fund vote for the approval of the investment advisory agreement other business the board knows of no other business to be brought before the special meeting  however if any other matters properly come before the special meeting proxies that do not contain specific instructions to the contrary will be voted on such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons designated therein submission of shareholder proposals

brokers and dealers is to obtain the best results taking into account factors such as the general execution and operational facilities of the broker or dealer the type and size of the transaction involved the creditworthiness of the broker or dealer the stability of the broker or dealer execution and settlement capabilities time required to negotiate and execute the trade research services and the manager’s arrangements related thereto as described below overall performance the dealer’s risk in positioning the securities involved and the broker’s commissions and dealer’s spread or markup  while the manager generally seeks the best price in placing its orders the fund may not necessarily be paying the lowest price available     proxy statement           notwithstanding the preceding paragraph in compliance with section e of the securities exchange act the manager may select brokers who charge a commission in excess of that charged by other brokers if the manager determines in good faith that the commission to be charged is reasonable in relation to the brokerage and research services provided to the manager by such brokers  research services generally consist of research or oral advice from brokers and dealers regarding particular companies industries or general economic conditions  the manager may also have arrangements with brokers pursuant to which such brokers provide research services to the manager in exchange for a certain volume of brokerage transactions to be executed by such broker  while the payment of higher commissions increases the fund’s costs the manager does not believe that the research significantly reduces its expenses as the manager solicitation of proxies and voting requirements this solicitation is being made primarily by the mailing of this proxy statement along with a notice of the special meeting and proxy card on or about march    supplementary solicitations may be made by mail telephone telegraph facsimile electronic means or personal interview by representatives of the fund  in addition the altman group inc may be paid on a percall basis to solicit shareholders by telephone on behalf of the fund  the fund may also arrange to have votes recorded by telephone  the altman group inc   is a third party proxy vendor that the fund has engaged to contact shareholders and record proxy votes  in order to hold a shareholder meeting a quorum must be reached as explained below  if a quorum is not attained the meeting must adjourn to a future date  voting your shares immediately will help minimize additional solicitation expenses and prevent the need to call you to solicit your vote voting instructions may be revoked at any time prior to the final vote at the special meeting by  written instruction addressed to the secretary of the fund  attendance at the special meeting and voting in person or  by proper execution and return of a new proxy card if received in time to be voted  mere attendance at the special meeting will not revoke voting instructions a quorum of shareholders is required to take action at the special meeting  a majority of the shares of the fund entitled to vote at the special meeting represented in person or by proxy will constitute a quorum of shareholders at the special meeting   votes cast by proxy or in person at the special meeting will be tabulated by the inspectors of election appointed for the special meeting  the inspectors of election on behalf of the fund will determine whether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting  the inspectors of election will treat abstentions and “broker nonvotes” ie shares held by brokers or nominees typically in “street name” as to which proxies have been returned but a instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and b the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter as present for purposes of determining a quorum     proxy statement           if you hold shares directly not through a brokerdealer bank or other financial intermediary and if you return a signed proxy card that does not specify how you wish to vote on a proposal your shares will be voted “for” the proposal as applicable   brokerdealer firms holding shares of the fund in “street name” for the benefit of their customers and clients will request the instructions of such customers and clients on how to vote their shares on each proposal before the special meeting  the new york stock exchange the “nyse” has taken the position that a brokerdealer that is a member of the nyse and that has not received instructions from a customer or client prior to the date specified in the brokerdealer firm’s request for voting instructions may not vote such customer or client’s shares with respect to the proposal  a signed proxy card or other authorization by a beneficial owner of fund shares that does not specify how the beneficial owner’s shares should be voted on the proposal will be deemed an instruction to vote such shares in favor of the applicable proposal   if you hold shares of the fund through a service agent that has entered into a service agreement with the fund or a distributor of the fund the service agent may be the record holder of your shares  at the special meeting a service agent will vote shares for which it receives instructions from its customers in accordance with those instructions  a signed proxy card or other authorization by a shareholder that does not specify how the shareholder’s shares should be voted on the proposal may be deemed to authorize a service provider to vote such shares in favor of the proposal  depending on its policies applicable law or contractual or other restrictions a service agent may be permitted to vote shares with respect to which it has not received specific voting instructions from its customers  in those cases the service agent may but may not be required to vote such shares in the same proportion as those shares for which the service agent has received voting instructions  this practice is commonly referred to as “echo voting” if you beneficially own shares that are held in “street name” through a brokerdealer or that are held of record by a service agent and if you do not give specific voting instructions for your shares they may not be voted at all or as described above they may be voted in a manner that you may not intend  therefore you are strongly encouraged to give your brokerdealer or service agent specific instructions as to how you want your shares to be voted a majority of the shares of the fund entitled to vote at the meeting represented in person or by proxy will constitute a quorum of shareholders at the meeting  failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate adjournment  the chairman of the special meeting or persons named in the enclosed proxy may also move for an adjournment of the special meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies with respect to the proposal if they determine that adjournment and further solicitation is reasonable and in the best interests of the fund  under the fund’s bylaws an adjournment of a meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting  the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote according to their discretion on any motion for an adjournment of the special meeting  abstentions and broker nonvoters will have no effect on the outcome of a vote to adjourn the special meeting  the special meeting may be adjourned to a date not more than  days after the original record date shareholders of record of the fund at the close of business on the record date will be entitled to vote at the special meeting  other than any principal shareholders disclosed above to the knowledge of the fund no other shareholder owned of record or beneficially more than  of the outstanding shares of the fund as of the record date  each whole share you hold as of the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote and each fractional share is entitled to a proportionate fractional vote the fund expects that the solicitation will be primarily by mail but also may include telephone facsimile or oral solicitations  if the fund does not receive your proxy by a certain time you may receive a telephone call from the altman group inc fund officers employees or agents asking you to vote  the fund does not reimburse officers of the fund or regular employees and agents involved in the solicitation of proxies the expenses in connection with preparing this proxy statement and its enclosures and all related legal expenses and all solicitations will be paid by the investment adviser and legg mason  it is anticipated that the total cost of preparing printing and mailing the proxy statement will be approximately      proxy statement           service
