our sole officer and director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process to effectiveness of this registration statement but we will require full funding to begin to implement our complete business plan while almost all the media attention in crowdfunding goes to mega platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo there are hundreds of other crowdfunding websites in the marketplace according to statista statistacom  there are  crowdfunding platforms worldwide and of those  were located in the united states other crowdfunding platforms included gofundme gogetfunding patreon tubestart pozible and rockethub to name a few a comparison of the two main players kickstarter and indiegogo in the rewardsbased crowding funding platforms is as follows beebomcom  comparison factor kickstarter indiegogo success rate   campaign model allornothing flexible boundary limitations usa uk canada international percentage share   successful amount raised  billion  million projects launched   total pledges  million  million both of these platforms are widely respected and are arguably the leaders on the growing crowdfunding industry a growing number of niche players are growing throughout the world providing even more competition company description fundthatcompany ftc proposes to establish a rewardsbased online crowdfunding platform according to the oxford dictionary crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising many small amounts of money from a large number of people typically via the internet musicians filmmakers and artists have successfully raised funds and fostered awareness through crowdfunding ftc plans to offer small startup businesses or entrepreneurs to post a project available for funding on ftcs proposed rewardbased crowdfunding platform in return for backing a project backerspledge donors receive different rewards defined by the business or entrepreneur depending on the amount of funding they commit our platform will focus on projects that are stipulated categories including renewable energy art music film books fashion food and technologies ftc intends to offer a wide range of tools and tips to help businesses or entrepreneurs execute a successful rewardsbased funding campaign ftc plans to offer the options of allornothing or keep everything funding models in the allornothing model project creators choose a specific amount of money in advance the goaltarget the project only succeeds and money only changes hands if this amount is reached within a particular time frame in the keep everything model project creators keep all funds even if the crowdfunding target is not reached project creators will have a  control over their products and services our platform will not permit contributors to become investors or shareholders nor can they qualify as accredited investors to participate in any financial returns fundthatcompany ftc is an early stage company that intends to focus on a rewardsbased crowdfunding model ftc does not intend to curate the projects that it hosts we plan to position ourselves as an inclusive community that does not decide which projects merit funding ftc will allow a wide range of categories and whether a project gets funded is up to potential supporters in addition ftc will not pick projects to promote on our site that is not to say that anything goes in terms of launching projects in order to launch a campaign on ftcs site the presenter must conform to ftcs term on use these would include but not limited to things like being over the age of  not offering alcohol or weapons as a reward and not using the site to disparage other individuals or companies project creators will have a  control over their products and services our platform will not permit contributors to become investors or shareholders nor can they qualify as accredited investors to participate in any financial returns the key to success will be the companys ability to differentiate ourselves from all other rewardsbased crowdfunding platforms this will be a difficult task we will need to not only gain market acceptance of our platform but be able standout from the crowd in our brand recognition to help we will include on our proposed platform advice references and tools to assist project providers in making a video templates to summarize a campaign page suggestions on setting a funding goal and deadline suggestions on marketing a project to pledge donors suggestions on rewards and perks offering great rewards by project providers is one of the best ways to encourage support for a project depending on the type of project being offered often determines the type of reward being offered this could include copies on what the project is making signed prints tickets to the project show and things like tshirts and totes rewards that have been offered in kickstarter and indiegogo rewardsbased projects have include bike tours studio visits food photography script scraps fifteen minutes of podcast fame dinner for two bumper stickers handcrafted mugs sheet music backstage passes headwear such as beanies handwritten postcards cool calendars to name just a few providing tools to assist projects is important but we believe to really achieve brand recognition we will need to market our proposed platform in a distinct nontraditional way via clever streaming videos social media and mainstream advertising within the united states we intend to stress the excitement and fun of presenting projects on our proposed site we plan to offer more support and guidance for our customers and pledge donors we hope that our proposed site will eventually become a community over time in the end the key to success of our proposed rewardsbase crowdfunding platform will be the quality of projects that we attract to our site the more successful the projects the more recognition for our platform we have not yet begun the development of our website but have procured a web domain name of fundthatcompanycom during the next  months fundthatcompany intends to continue its ongoing research and marketing plan by attending two tradeshowsconferences the one spark festival held once a year in jacksonville florida in april  the other conference we have targeted is the renewable energy conference to be held in london uk in november of  we also intend to develop a unique logo we will also source thirdparty companies to assist us in social media and traditional marketing and setting up the companys online platform website and begin to market our proposed rewardsbased crowdfunding product  there is the likelihood that we may never be able to gain acceptance of our proposed rewardsbased crowdfunding platform in the marketplace that the company would need to successfully complete its plan of operation and develop and implement the companys website platform if our company is not capable of building a market for its proposed product all funds that we spend on development will be lost  we were incorporated under the laws of nevada effective september   our principal business offices are  moo  sattahip district

as stocks bonds and shortterm debt the combined holdings of the mutual fund are known as its portfolio investors buy shares in mutual funds each share represents an investor’s part ownership in the fund and the income it generates why do people buy mutual fundswhat types of mutual funds are therewhat are the benefits and risks of mutual fundshow to buy and sell mutual fundsunderstanding feesavoiding fraudadditional information why do people buy mutual funds mutual funds are a popular choice among investors because they generally offer the following features professional management the fund managers do the research for you they select the securities and monitor the performance diversification or “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” mutual funds typically invest in a range of companies and industries this helps to lower your risk if one company fails affordability most mutual funds set a relatively low dollar amount for initial investment and subsequent purchases liquidity mutual fund investors can easily redeem their shares at any time for the current net asset value nav plus any redemption fees what types of mutual funds are there most mutual funds fall into one of four main categories – money market funds bond funds stock funds and target date funds each type has different features risks and rewards money market funds have relatively low risks by law they can invest only in certain highquality shortterm investments issued by us corporations and federal state and local governments bond funds have higher risks than money market funds because they typically aim to produce higher returns because there are many different types of bonds the risks and rewards of bond funds can vary dramatically stock funds invest in corporate stocks not all stock funds are the same some examples are growth funds focus on stocks that may not pay a regular dividend but have potential for aboveaverage financial gains income funds invest in stocks that pay regular dividends index funds track a particular market index such as the standard  poor’s  index sector funds specialize in a particular industry segment target date funds hold a mix of stocks bonds and other investments over time the mix gradually shifts according to the fund’s strategy target date funds sometimes known as lifecycle funds are designed for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind what are the benefits and risks of mutual funds mutual funds offer professional investment management and potential diversification they also offer three ways to earn money dividend payments a fund may earn income from dividends on stock or interest on bonds the fund then pays the shareholders nearly all the income less expenses capital gains distributions the price of the securities in a fund may increase when a fund sells a security that has increased in price the fund has a capital gain at the end of the year the fund distributes these capital gains minus any capital losses to investors increased nav if the market value of a fund’s portfolio increases after deducting expenses then the value of the fund and its shares increases the higher nav reflects the higher value of your investment all funds carry some level of risk with mutual funds you may lose some or all of the money you invest because the securities held by a fund can go down in value dividends or interest payments may also change as market conditions change a fund’s past performance is not as important as you might think because past performance does not predict future returns but past performance can tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been over a period of time the more volatile the fund the higher the investment risk how to buy and sell mutual funds investors buy mutual fund shares from the fund itself or through a broker for the fund rather than from other investors the price that investors pay for the mutual fund is the fund’s per share net asset value plus any fees charged at the time of purchase such as sales loads mutual fund shares are “redeemable” meaning investors can sell the shares back to the fund at any time the fund usually must send you the payment within seven days before buying shares in a mutual fund read the prospectus carefully the prospectus contains information about the mutual fund’s investment objectives risks performance and expenses see how to read a mutual fund prospectus part  part  and part  to learn more about key information in a prospectus understanding fees as with any business running a mutual fund involves costs funds pass along these costs to investors by charging fees and expenses fees and expenses vary from fund to fund a fund with high costs must perform better than a lowcost fund to generate the same returns for you even small differences in fees can mean large differences in returns over time for example if you invested  in a fund with a  annual return and annual operating expenses of  after  years you would have roughly  if you invested in a fund with the same performance and expenses of  after  years you would end up with  it takes only minutes to use a mutual fund cost calculator to compute how the costs of different mutual funds add up over time and eat into your returns see the mutual fund glossary for types of fees avoiding fraud by law each mutual fund is required to file a prospectus and regular shareholder reports with the sec before you invest be sure to read the prospectus and the required shareholder reports additionally the investment portfolios of mutual funds are managed by separate entities know as “investment advisers” that are registered with the sec always check that the investment adviser is registered before investing additional information mutual funds  a guide for
