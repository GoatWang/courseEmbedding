cell  core technology rosetta rosetta has been developed over the past  years beginning at the lab of prof david baker at the university of washington and at over  other labs around the world rosetta began as a tool for protein modeling combining knowledgebased and physical modeling approaches with a consistent focus on actionable experimental results over the last  years rosetta has evolved into the worldleading tool for computational protein design samplingrosetta primarily uses monte carlo based sampling using knowledge of protein structure from the protein data bank pdb protein backbones are primarily modeled using “fragments” derived from the pdb using an array of powerful bioinformatics tools for example blast — all of which is built in to cyrus bench behind the scenes protein sidechains are modeled using the now yearold “rotamer” concept with constant refinement over the years scoringrosetta uses a combination of physical and knowledgederived potentials to score proteins
