james h reed pa commercial realtor associate   email me commercial sales james h reed pa commercial realtor associate   email me owning a home home price appreciation condos and home associations improving real estate insurance taxes refinancing home price appreciation how can i improve the value of my property outside of a homeowners control the biggest factor is market conditions other important issues are condition of the property specific home improvements neighborhood stability and safety the greatest rise in home prices occurs when the economy is strong and the number of home sales is increasing specific home improvements can increase the value above the cost of the improvements remodeled bathroom returns  percent to the owner bathroom addition  percent master bedroom suite  percent remember quality pays wellplanned and wellexecuted remodeling jobs are a good investment while bad work seldom enhances value or livability the safety and security of a neighborhood can affect property values too if you live in a highcrime area an organized community watch program not only will lower the crime rate but give home values a boost too how can i increase the value of my property specific home improvements can increase your property value above the cost of the improvements themselves such as remodeling a kitchen adding a bathroom finishing a basement or upgrading landscaping just be sure that quality pays with remodeling a bad remodeling job will do little to boost your property value if you live in a highcrime area an organized community watch program not only will lower the crime rate but can enhance property values too it also helps to live in an area where other homeowners are upgrading their homes which can help pull up your property value too the bottom line is to measure the cost of any improvements you want to make against the overall values in your neighborhood if you over improve for the neighborhood you may not necessarily recover your costs or boost your property value significantly will buying a bigger home increase my profit consider these questions before making a choice between adding on to an existing home or moving up in the market to a bigger house how much money is available either from cash reserves or through a home improvement loan to remodel the current house how much additional space is required would the foundation support a second floor or does the lot have room to expand on the ground level what do local zoning and building ordinances permit how much equity already exists in the property are there affordable properties for sale that would satisfy housing needs ultimately the decision should be based on individual needs the extent of work involved and what will add the most value how do i find out how much my home is worth a comparative market analysis and an appraisal are the standard methods for determining a homes value your real estate agent will be able to provide a comparative market analysis an informal estimate of value based on comparable sales in the neighborhood be sure you get listing prices of current homes on the market as well as those that have sold you also can research this yourself by checking on recent sales in public records be sure that you are researching properties that are similar in size construction and location this information is not only available at your local recorders or assessors office but also through private companies and on the internet an appraisal which generally costs  to  to perform is a certified appraisers opinion of the value of a home at any given time appraisers review numerous factors including recent comparable sales location square footage and construction quality what are the differences between market value and appraised value the appraised value of a house is a certified appraisers opinion of the worth of a home at a given point in time lenders require appraisals as part of the loan application process fees range from  to  market value is what price the house will bring at a given point in time a comparative market analysis is an informal estimate of market value based on sales of comparable properties performed by a real estate agent or broker either an appraisal or a comparative market analysis is the most accurate way to determine what your home is worth condos and home associations are condos a good investment condominiums have held their value as an investment despite economic downturns and problems with some associations in fact condos have appreciated more in the past few years than when they first came on the scene in the late s and early s experts say while there are lots of reports about homeowners association disputes and constructiondefect problems the industry has worked hard to turn its image around elected volunteers who serve on association boards are better trained at handling complex budget and legal issues for example while many boards go to great lengths to avoid the kind of protracted and expensive litigation that has hurt resale value in the past meanwhile changing demographics are making condominiums more attractive investments for single homebuyers empty nesters and firsttime buyers in expensive markets what kinds of rules and regulations do associations regulate typical covenants codes and restrictions ccrs which govern condo associations give the board authority to make and enforce reasonable rules for the use of common property but that would not apply to interior spaces owned by smokers themselves a homeowners associations board of directors can restrict smoking if it applies to indoor common spaces such as hallways or recreation rooms outdoor spaces are a different story say legal experts any restriction would probably hinge on local laws ie if a city banned smoking outdoors a homeowners association probably could restrict smoking in its outdoor spaces the  americans with disabilities act does not require strictly residential apartments and singlefamily homes to be made accessible but all new construction of public accommodations or commercial projects such as a government building or a shopping mall must be accessible new multifamily construction also falls into this category in all states the federal fair housing act provides protection against discrimination for people with physical or mental disabilities discrimination includes the refusal to make reasonable modifications to buildings that arent accessible to the disabled what fees can i expect to pay a home association condominium owners pay a fee usually monthly to the homeowners association to cover the costs of managing and maintaining all common areas in addition you may pay extra assessments for major maintenance projects in general these must be voted on by the association board or in some cases by all of the owners the particular cost of monthly fees and the rules regarding special assessments vary from association to association when considering a condominium its a good idea to thoroughly research the fees and bylaws of the condo association are homeowner association fees tax deductible homeowners association fees are considered personal living expenses and are not taxdeductible if however an association has a special assessment to make one or more capital improvements condo owners may be able to add the expense to their cost basis cost basis is a term for the money an owner spends for permanent improvements throughout their time in the home and is used to reduce eventual capital gains taxes when the property is sold for example if the association puts a new roof on a building the expense could be considered part of a condo owners cost basis only if they lived directly underneath it overall improvements to common areas such as the installation of a swimming pool need to be considered on a casebycase basis but most can be included in the cost basis of any owner who can show their home directly benefits from the work to find out more about how the irs views condo association fees look to irs publication  your federal income tax which includes a section on condos order a free copy by calling  taxform improving real estate are there government programs for rehabilitation the us department of housing and urban developments section  k rehabilitation loan program is designed to facilitate major structural rehabilitation of houses with one to four units that are more than one year old condominiums are not eligible the k loan is usually done as a combination loan to purchase a fixerupper property as is and rehabilitate it or to refinance a temporary loan to buy the property and do the rehabilitation it can also be done as a rehabilitationonly loan plans and specifications for the proposed work must be submitted for architectural review and cost estimation mortgage proceeds are advanced periodically during the rehabilitation period to finance the construction costs for a list of participating lenders call hud at   if you are a veteran loans from the us department of veterans affairs also can be used to buy a home build a home improve a home or to refinance an existing loan va loans frequently offer lower interest rates than ordinarily available with other kinds of loans to qualify for a loan the first step is to apply for a certificate of eligibility another program is the federal housing administrations title  fha loan program how much can i expect to spend on maintenance experts generally agree that you can plan on annually spending  percent of the purchase price of your house on repairing gutters caulking windows sealing your driveway and the myriad other maintenance chores that come with the privilege of homeownership newer homes will cost less to maintain than older homes it also depends on how well the house has been maintained over the years what repairs should i make before putting a home on the market if you want to get top dollar for your property you probably need to make all minor repairs and selected major repairs before going on the market nearly all purchase contracts include an inspection clause a buyer contingency that allows a buyer to back out if numerous defects are found or negotiate their repair the trick is not to overspend on presale repairs especially if there are few houses on the market but many buyers willing to buy at almost any price on the other hand making such repairs may be the only way to sell your house in a down market can neighbor problems devalue the property while it may not reduce the actual value a cluttered landscape next door can detract from the positive aspects of your home review your local laws which should be on file at the public library county law library or city hall a typical junk vehicle ordinance for example requires any disabled car to either be enclosed or placed behind a fence and most cities prohibit parking any vehicle on a city street too long it also may be worthwhile to check into local zoning ordinances an operator of a homebased business usually is required to obtain a variance or permanent zoning change in residential areas in addition if a neighbors repair work produces loud noises he may be breaking local noisecontrol ordinances which are enforced by the police department before bringing in the authorities you may want to make a copy of the pertinent ordinance and give it to your neighbor to give them a chance to correct the problem insurance what kind of insurance do i need a standard homeowners policy protects against fire lightning wind storms hail explosions riots aircraft wrecks vehicle crashes smoke vandalism theft breaking glass falling objects weight of snow or sleet collapsing buildings freezing of plumbing fixtures electrical damage and water damage from plumbing heating or air conditioning systems according to the insurance information institute a washington dcbased nonprofit group for the insurance industry such policies are allrisk policies which cover everything except earthquakes floods war and nuclear accidents a basic policy can be expanded to include additional coverage such as for floods and earthquakes and even workers compensation for servants or contractors homebased businesscoverage an increasingly popular rider does not cover liability associated with the business insurance experts recommend that homeowners obtain insurance equal to the full replacement value of the home on a squarefoot home for example if the replacement cost is  per square foot the house should be insured for at least  for personal items homeowners can increase their coverage beyond the depreciated value of items such as televisions or furniture by purchasing a replacementcost endorsement on personal property some experts recommend an inflation rider which increases coverage as the home increases in value what is guaranteed replacement cost insurance guaranteed replacement insurance is a more comprehensive policy it tends to cost more but it promises to cover the complete costs less deductible of replacing a destroyed house with these sorts of policies limits on the policies are not as common because complete coverage is more explicit taxes can property taxes be deducted property taxes on all real estate including those levied by state and local governments and school districts are fully deductible against current income taxes mortgage interest and property taxes are deductible on a second home if you itemize check with your accountant or tax adviser for specifics how are property taxes configured property taxes are what most homeowners in the united states pay for the privilege of owning a piece of real estate on average  percent of the propertys current market value these annual local assessments by county or local authorities help pay for public services and are calculated using a variety of formulas how does home mortgage tax deductions work the mortgage interest deduction entitles you to completely deduct the interest on your home loan for the year in which you paid it mortgage interest is not a dollarfordollar tax cut it reduces taxable income you must itemize deductions in order to do this which means your total deductions must exceed the irss standard deduction another point to remember is that the amount of interest on your loan goes down each year you pay on your mortgage all standard homeloan formulas pay off interest first before significantly paying into principal thats why paying extra on your principal every year can help you pay off your loan early what is an impound account an impound account is a trust account established by the lender to hold money to pay for real estate taxes and mortgage and homeowners insurance premiums as they are received each month are points deductible if you are a buyer and you or the seller pays points they are deductible for the year in which they are paid only you also can deduct any points you pay when you refinance your home but you must do so ratably over the life of the loan consult your tax or financial advisor are there tax breaks for firsttime buyers many city and county governments offer mortgage credit certificate programs which allow firsttime homebuyers to take advantage of a special federal income tax writeoff which makes qualifying for a mortgage loan easier requirements vary from program to program people wanting to apply should contact their local housing or community development office some things to keep in mind some credit may be claimed only on your owneroccupied principal residence there are maximum income limits which vary by locality and family size you must be a firsttime homebuyer which means you must not have had any kind of ownership interest in a principal residence during the past three years this restriction may be waived however if you are buying property within certain target areas allocations must be available a local mcc program may have to decline new applications when it runs out of funds are home improvements deductible what you spend on permanent home improvements such as new windows can be added into your homes cost basis or amount of money invested in a home which reduces capital gains when it comes time to sell capital gains are determined by the difference in price from the time a home is purchased and the time it is sold minus the cost of any permanent improvements however the  tax changes virtually eliminate the capital gains tax for most homeowners the exemption is  for single homeowners and  for married homeowners still it is worthwhile to save all receipts for permanent home improvements just in case they also can be useful documentation when it comes to marketing your home when you sell refinancing when is the best time to refinance it depends on how long you plan to hold on to your house and if you have to pay anything to refinance in addition it also depends on how far along you are in paying off your current mortgage if you are going to be selling your house shortly you probably will not recoup any costs you incur to refinance your mortgage if you are more than halfway through paying your current mortgage you probably will gain little by refinancing however if you are going to own your home for at least five years thats probably long enough to recoup any refinancing costs you incur and to realize real savings on lowering your monthly payment if it is going to cost you nothing to refinance you can gain even more many lenders will allow you to roll the costs of the refinancing into the new note and still reduce the amount of the monthly payment also there are nocost refinancing deals available in any case it pays to consult your lender or financial advisor or run the numbers yourself before you refinance what are the advantagesdisadvantages of nocost loans in many states real estate regulatory agencies are cracking down on such advertising the very term nocost loan is misleading because borrowers are actually paying a higher interest rate in exchange for not having to pay fees or closing costs up front when the loan is secured a nopoints loan is one for which the lender does not charge points one point is equal to  percent of the loan amount but there are other fees involved in nopoint loans as with most loans how does bankruptcy affect my refinancing refinancing may be prudent but could be difficult after a bankruptcy if youre considering bankruptcy you may want to go to your current lender first and explain the situation if you have been current on your payments the lender may be accommodating and refinance your loan easing your financial situation which home buying costs are deductible any points you or the seller pay to purchase your home loan are deductible for that year property taxes and interest are deductible every year but while other homebuying costs closing costs in particular are not immediately taxdeductible they can be figured into the adjusted cost basis of your home when you go to sell any significant home improvements also can be calculated into your basis these fees would include title insurance loanapplication fee credit report appraisal fee service fee settlement or closing fees bank attorneys fee attorneys fee document preparation fee and recording fees points paid when you refinance an existing mortgage must be deducted ratably over the life of the new loan microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history must
