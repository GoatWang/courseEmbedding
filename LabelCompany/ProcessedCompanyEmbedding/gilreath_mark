cyber security merger propels portland oregon – israel business st louis lands kaiima initial success for sliic mark gilreath is as strong a supporter of israel as any american i know his support however is not built around faith although as a christian visiting jerusalem holds special meaning for him history or politics   rather his ties to the holy land are related to his passion for the people of israel developed originally through his business activities there in late july during the midst of the israelhamas war i was copied on an email from him the message was actually sent to the employees of endochoice the atlantabased company mark founded in his basement in  that has grown to over  employees worldwide including  at the endochoice innovation center in caesaria   this is what he said “during my recent visit to israel hamas had begun firing missiles from gaza and i had the unusual experience of hearing the sirens and rushing into a bomb shelter  honestly it was frightening  it’s very difficult for me to imagine this as a routine experience for my family and children  i continue to be amazed by the strength of our colleagues in israel  during this month of july they’ve been working tirelessly to deliver an improved version of full spectrum endoscopy which will save lives through improved detection of colon cancer  at the same time they are under constant assault from thousands of missiles that have been fired at their families and communities in israel while the news channels and media are busy reporting it appears that the critical facts are often missed  of course there are many opinions on this topic  but at a high level if the missiles from gaza stop the war is over  a brief article in the washington post brings more clarity to the issue this situation is very sad for israelis and palestinians  our thoughts and prayers remain with our friends in israel and also for the palestinian people suffering from the decisions of hamas leadership  we pray for peace we stand with israel” mark first visited israel in  as a  yearold consultant for given imaging and as that company’s first nonisraeli employee  he went there to meet with gabi meron the company’s founding ceo with whom he had previous dealings when mark was an executive at pentax and gabi was at applitec mark had incorporated one of that israeli company’s image solutions into one of pentax’s products   he found that the israelis were totally different from the japanese decision makers at pentax  the reason he joined given imaging was because of his belief in gabi the technology was secondary  “i was attracted by the israeli character and israeli characters” mark says gilreath went on to become president of given imaging’s north america operation in atlanta and ultimately he became the yokneambased company’s global chief marketing officer  during his  years there given imaging developer of the famed pillcam™ became one of israel’s most admired exciting and successful publicly traded companies mark took his business passion for israel and israelis with him when he founded endochoice that has the mission to “serve the gi caregiver”  this young company has created their own suite of products with high margins contributing to its fast growth  is the th straight year they were recognized as one of the fasting growing companies in the us by inc magazine  in  endochoice received a huge investment by sequoia capital both the palo alto and israeli funds and “merged” with caesariabased peer medical as well as acquired a german manufacturer of endoscopes the result is fuse™ full spectrum endoscopy a revolutionary endoscope now fda approved and in use in the us europe and around the world  the fuse system is comprised of colonoscopes and gastroscopes with multiple imagers so doctors can see more of the gi tract for diagnosis and treatment  the fuse colonoscope provides a field of view of  degrees versus  degrees from traditional endoscopes  in a recent clinical study fuse found  more precancerous polyps than traditional colonoscopes  patients are beginning to “insist on fuse” for their colonoscopies having a global footprint in the us germany and israel the company does not seem to have a problem with cross cultures  with fuse endochoice has the ability to be the ‘outlier’  the product has gone through adaptations for the past   years and is now making a tremendous difference in patients’ lives  mark told me that essentially they bought a “science project” not a fully formed product or company in israel  also with fuse their revenue projections have increased exponentially for the coming years many of mark’s closest friends are israelis  he says they are “like new yorkers with an exponent”   he feels israelis are passionate and direct and that he shares a common drive with them to achieve the goal  “you want them by your side  they didn’t sign on for a job—it’s a cause to them  they are brilliant and emotionally stronger than most—wonderful partners in building a worldclass organization” he adds israelis are lucky to have mark gilreath standing with them during good times and bad   he should be an inspiration to

at a high level if the missiles from gaza stop the war is over  a brief article in the washington post brings more clarity to the issue this situation is very sad for israelis and palestinians  our thoughts and prayers remain with our friends in israel and also for the palestinian people suffering from the decisions of hamas leadership  we pray for peace we stand with israel” mark first visited israel in  as a  yearold consultant for given imaging and as that company’s first nonisraeli employee  he went there to meet with gabi meron the company’s founding ceo with whom he had previous dealings when mark was an executive at pentax and gabi was at applitec mark had incorporated one of that israeli company’s image solutions into one of pentax’s products   he found that the israelis were totally different from the japanese decision makers at pentax  the reason he joined given imaging was because of his belief in gabi the technology was secondary  “i was attracted by the israeli character and israeli characters” mark says gilreath went on to become president of given imaging’s north america operation in atlanta and ultimately he became the yokneambased company’s global chief marketing officer  during his  years there given imaging developer of the famed pillcam™ became one of israel’s most admired exciting and successful publicly traded companies mark took his business passion for israel and israelis with him when he founded endochoice that has the mission to “serve the gi caregiver”  this young company has created their own suite of products with high margins contributing to its fast growth  is the th straight year they were recognized as one of the fasting growing companies in the us by inc magazine  in  endochoice received a huge investment by sequoia capital both the palo alto and israeli funds and “merged” with caesariabased peer medical as well as acquired a german manufacturer of endoscopes the result is fuse™ full spectrum endoscopy a revolutionary endoscope now fda approved and in use in the us europe and around the world  the fuse system is comprised of colonoscopes and gastroscopes with multiple imagers so doctors can see more of the gi tract for diagnosis and treatment  the fuse colonoscope provides a field of view of  degrees versus  degrees from traditional endoscopes  in a recent clinical study fuse found  more precancerous polyps than traditional colonoscopes  patients are beginning to “insist on fuse” for their colonoscopies having a global footprint in the us germany and israel the company does not seem to have a problem with cross cultures  with fuse endochoice has the ability to be the ‘outlier’  the product has gone through adaptations for the past   years and is now making a tremendous difference in patients’ lives  mark told me that essentially they bought a “science project” not a fully formed product or company in israel  also with fuse their revenue projections have increased exponentially for the coming years many of mark’s closest friends are israelis  he says they are “like new yorkers with an exponent”   he feels israelis are passionate and direct and that he shares a common drive with them to achieve the goal  “you want them by your side  they didn’t sign on for a job—it’s a cause to them  they are brilliant and emotionally stronger than most—wonderful partners in building a worldclass organization” he adds israelis are lucky to have mark gilreath standing with them during good times and bad   he should be an inspiration to american business leaders as well as to the
