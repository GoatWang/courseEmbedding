the ncta conference in chicago got a glimpse at the future as brian roberts demonstrated some of the fastest broadband speeds and shared our nextgeneration television experience with them brian downloaded the current season of  rock for the audience in about a minute and a half using the first ever  gbps broadband speed download over a production hfc network and for those of you who were doing the math the current season of  rock has  episodes with a total run time of almost nine hours our engineers worked with our local chicago system and teams at cisco and ookla to create and deliver this demonstration of the future of broadband today comcast offers internet speeds up to  mbps — and weve been increasing speeds for our customers every year since we launched in  with just  mbps of speed we deliver more speed to more homes than any other isp in america and well keep up that pace as the internet continues to evolve turning to the tv brian also introduced the crowd to

georgia and includes a completely new cloudbased user interface with advanced navigation and access to more content including select online videos and apps delivered over ip so what do fast internet speeds and really cool tv have in common the comcast network and technology infrastructure whether its downloading the current season of  rock in just  seconds or using ip technology and our own cloud servers to make the television screen more personal and interactive this evolution is possible because of the way weve built our network  its flexible and scalable while were using our network to
