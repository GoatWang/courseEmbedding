of june   month in review june was a tale of two halves early in the month european central bank ecb president mario draghi led the eurozone towards continued excessive accommodation which caused rates to move much lower across europe however coordinated hawkish central bank messaging at the end of the month reversed the relentless flattening of the yield curve while the testimony of former fbi director james comey was a nonevent as far as financial markets were concerned the fed raised the fed funds rate for the second time this year in midmonth while laying out a plan to reduce its massive  trillion balance sheet which should start in the near term as of now it appears the fed will allow  billion of us treasury exposure to roll off monthly and  billion for agency mortgages with these caps increasing over time to limit market impact while one would expect this to cause interest rates to rise a lack of global inflation has yield curves flattening with rates near their yeartodate lows yet again although this reversed somewhat at the end of the month looking forward commodity prices are again on top of investors’ minds due to the large oil selloff and the implications this has for global investors in addition we may learn of nominations to fill vacant fed seats in addition to janet yellen’s future as her term is set to expire in february  this of course would have implications for global markets looking ahead the first half of the year was fairly quiet from a historical volatility perspective and we do expect more volatility in the back half of  global energy prices impact everything from the health of emerging markets to consumer spending habits so we will be keeping a close eye on commodity prices and the impact for global risk and rate markets most market participants believe it’s a close call whether the fed hikes again in  however our team also believes it will be imperative to watch the impact of the beginning of the wind down of the fed’s balance sheet we are also paying close attention to the ecb as any sign of inflation may cause a change in policy the ecb has remained very accommodative however growth and labor markets are improving in addition a reduction in geopolitical risks may make it more likely that the ecb moves towards a less accommodative policy in the third quarter fees and minimums fees widget loading

returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves

strategymarketplacecambridge income laboratorysummaryclosedend funds cefs cover a wide segment of the investment universei survey the different classes of cefs in cefconnects databasebe aware that the labels are sometimes inconsistentauthors note this article was released to members of the cambridge income laboratory about  month ago a member asked me about the different classes of cefs and the strategies that they employ i thought that this information would make a good introductory article for people who are new to cefs closed end funds first of all cefs are at their core funds just like their cousins the mutual fund and the exchangetraded fund etf a little known fact is that cefs actually have a longer history even than mutual funds and are therefore way older than etfs i have previously surveyed the different types of exchangetraded products here exchangetraded products series part  why invest cefs being funds simply own stocks bonds commodities or other instruments depending on their investment mandate cefs are also usually actively managed therefore cefs are merely a wrapper in which one can obtain their exposure to various asset classes strategies or geographical allocations it doesnt make sense to say for example that i own  in stocks  in bonds and  in cefs for the very reason that the cefs are likely themselves invested in some combination of equities and debt one can usually find a corresponding etf that matches the investment mandate of a particular cef notable exceptions are clo equity funds such as oxford lane capital corp nasdaqoxlc or eagle point credit company nyseecc or perhaps go anywhere bond funds that have a highly flexible mandate in that case what are the advantages of owning the cef over the etf i think can think of several active management from a hopefully seasoned investment manager leverage often at much cheaper rate that can be accessed by retail investors i am aware that etfsetns can be leveraged too but they do not cover the entire investment universe most importantly the ability of cefs to trade at premium or discount offers both pitfalls and opportunities such as cef arbitrage in terms of the different cef classes on offer i will use the categories employed by cefconnect the reason for this is that cefconnect is probably the most widely used cef resource site available and using the same categories will allow readers to easily source more information about a specific cef class should they desire the classes can be searched using cefconnects fund screener by selecting the strategies tab there are currently a total of  cefs in the cefconnects database for each category the number shown in parentheses indicates the number of cefs in that class i also present the largest cef in each category as an example any comments of mine are in italics i taxfree income  highyield  eg nuveen municipal high income opportunity fund nysenmz national  eg alliancebernstein national municipal

delaware investments national municipal income fund nysemktvcf  not sure why this doesnt belong in the muni category note that the cefconnect categories are not the be all and end all and oftentimes the classifications should be manually checked for instance the dnp select income fund dnp is classified as hybrid growth  income but with the majority of its portfolio  in utility stocks it really should have belonged to the utilities categories perhaps the meager  bond allocation of dnp is what caused it to be lumped with other hybrid funds but if thats the case why is macquarie global infrastructure total return fund nysemgu with  in utility stocks but also  in loans also grouped in utilities and not hybrid growth  income i have previously written about dnp here i would avoid dnp select income fund at the present time additionally the usnonus distinction used by cefconnect is not always applied consistently for example eaton vance taxmanaged global diversified equity income exg with  nonus exposure is classed under us equity whereas the blackrock science  technology trust bst which has even less international exposure  nonus is in the nonusother category in some cases a cef could plausibly be classed under two or even more categories but cefconnect only allows a single designation for instance the blackrock resources  commodities strategy trust bcx and the blackrock utility and infrastructure trust bui both employ option writing to boost their income but their investment focus means they are funneled into the energyresources and utilities groups respectively rather than covered call moreover these categories should just be considered as starting points for research cef research even within a single category fund performance can vary wildly as a case in point within the mlp space the tortoise energy infrastructure fund nysetyg has massively outperformed the cushing mlp total return fund nysesrv over the past five years i have previously written about srvs debacle here cushing mlp total return fund a lesson for cef investors this is why i spend significant time searching for the best cefs to choose from each class which would hopefully benefit you as well tyg total return price data by ycharts if i were to organize cefconnects database from scratch i might approach it in a slightly different way in the members section of the cambridge income

of june   month in review june was a tale of two halves early in the month european central bank ecb president mario draghi led the eurozone towards continued excessive accommodation which caused rates to move much lower across europe however coordinated hawkish central bank messaging at the end of the month reversed the relentless flattening of the yield curve while the testimony of former fbi director james comey was a nonevent as far as financial markets were concerned the fed raised the fed funds rate for the second time this year in midmonth while laying out a plan to reduce its massive  trillion balance sheet which should start in the near term as of now it appears the fed will allow  billion of us treasury exposure to roll off monthly and  billion for agency mortgages with these caps increasing over time to limit market impact while one would expect this to cause interest rates to rise a lack of global inflation has yield curves flattening with rates near their yeartodate lows yet again although this reversed somewhat at the end of the month looking forward commodity prices are again on top of investors’ minds due to the large oil selloff and the implications this has for global investors in addition we may learn of nominations to fill vacant fed seats in addition to janet yellen’s future as her term is set to expire in february  this of course would have implications for global markets looking ahead the first half of the year was fairly quiet from a historical volatility perspective and we do expect more volatility in the back half of  global energy prices impact everything from the health of emerging markets to consumer spending habits so we will be keeping a close eye on commodity prices and the impact for global risk and rate markets most market participants believe it’s a close call whether the fed hikes again in  however our team also believes it will be imperative to watch the impact of the beginning of the wind down of the fed’s balance sheet we are also paying close attention to the ecb as any sign of inflation may cause a change in policy the ecb has remained very accommodative however growth and labor markets are improving in addition a reduction in geopolitical risks may make it more likely that the ecb moves towards a less accommodative policy in the third quarter fees and minimums fees widget loading

returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in
