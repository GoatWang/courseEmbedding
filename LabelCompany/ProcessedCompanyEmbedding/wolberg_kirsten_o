business enablement team spent much of her career in financial services but her enthusiasm for technology drove her decision to make a big change in a qa that’s part of our new series on our company’s tech leaders she shares how she tackles complex technology problems and drives her team to continually innovate for the benefit of our customerswolberg has been with paypal for two years leading the global technology and business enablement gtbe team for paypal technology group which enables technology execution and innovation globally she oversees technology strategy planning and analytics technology mergers and acquisitions quality and release solutions load and performance testing enterprise transformation technology engagement and the new paypal open source officewhat got you interested in the technology sector and brought you to ebay incfor over  years i’ve spent my career in financial services  when you work in this industry you almost have to be interested in technology because you use technology to deliver products and services to your customers i’ve had roles both on the business side and technology side i’m partial to working on the tech side because i have an opportunity to work with engineers at the core engineers are problem solvers and i love solving large problems at scalei came to paypal because of the values and purpose of the company i had stepped out of financial services and payments to work at a software company for a few years it was a great company and i learned a lot but i missed the industry most of all i missed being surrounded by people who shared common values and are really passionate about the purpose of the company ebay inc is such a great place to work i feel really lucky to be herewhat are you working on that is helping to fuel ebay inc’s businessthe employees in the group i work with are focused on fueling innovation and business valueon may  we celebrated the oneyear anniversary of the launch of the paypal transformation this team has been very focused on enabling  global agile scrum teams to transform the way we plan build and deliver products to our customers in the time we’ve been working in this new way – the combined cross functional – teams have delivered more than  new productsthe quality  release solutions team has had a huge first quarter and innovated to make it possible for our engineers to release code five times a day through the new open window process it used to take weeks or months to release new products now it’s literally hours or days this team has also had a relentless focus on developing automation and cleaning up our legacy code base making the testing and release processes faster and more efficient for our developersfurthermore our technology engagement team is helping attract and retain the best talent for paypal technology through multiple awardwinning innovative programs like the small business challenge and the technology leadership programhow do you embody ebay inc’s purpose and values through your rolein my group our role is to look across the organization the technology across paypal and ebay inc and to make every effort to ensure that we are making the right decisions and doing the right thing at every level it doesn’t always make us popular but ultimately it is what will help drive customer and employee successa key example of how we’ve operationalized the principle of “debate decide and deliver” is the cross product line governance meeting that i chair with angela song from the product group in this forum we evaluate resources and priority contention between product lines and make key trade decisions these decisions are documented and shared so the teams know how to prioritize work requestsi’m a fanatical user of paypal’s products and i am so proud of my team who consistently shows up at the top of the “be the customer” leaderboardi have a very open honest and direct style of communication i regularly talk about the differences between “the executive truth” and the “ground truth” it’s important that my employees understand that i am open to and really want to hear the ground truth i believe i’ve created a trusting environment that enables all employees to be open honest and direct about what is working and what isn’t working across paypalwhat’s the best career advice you’ve received and how has it helped you develop your career in technologythe best career advice i received was back in  when i was faced with a career choice to either stay on a business path or to step “across the line” into a pure technology role my mentor at the time coached me to answer the following questions for myself to help make the decisionwhat job will you learn the most fromwhat job scares you the mostwhat job will leverage your innate ability your learned skills and your ambition the most after answering those questions i took the technology job and i’ve had a very happy career in technology ever since
