– it owned the naming rights to lp field the stadium which houses the tennessee titans and tennessee state university football teams in nashville forming a new companyedit louisianapacific was formed in july  when the georgiapacific corporation spun off the wholly owned subsidiary after georgiapacific had acquired  small firms in the southern united states the federal trade commission ftc accused the company of becoming a monopolist in the softwood plywood industry as part of its settlement with the ftc georgiapacific agreed to divest  percent of its assets william h hunt a vicechairman at georgiapacific was selected as louisianapacifics first chairman in  harry a merlo who had been chief executive officer of lp since its foundation succeeded hunt as chairman while remaining ceo prior to the official spinoff of lp georgiapacific had transferred several of its operations to lp ownership including its samoa ukiah intermountain weatherseal and southern divisions as well as its  percent investments in alaskas ketchikan pulp company ketchikan spruce mills inc and ketchikan international sales company however georgiapacific had kept most of its lowcost timber reserves and the bulk of its tree farms for itself thus the newly independent lp had to scramble for raw materials particularly timber as the july   portland oregonian explained this proved to be an especially difficult task as timber shortages wracked the entire industry overcutting japanese demand for logs and pressure on the us forest service to tighten harvesting restrictions on large trees caused prices to soar to make matters worse lp lost  acres of harvestable oldgrowth timberland with the expansion of the redwood national park in northern california merlo strove to shepherd the company through its early difficulties lp acquired several lumber companies in california oregon montana washington missouri and alabama and in  it purchased the fibreboard corporation a manufacturer of products used in making furniture and cabinets in  the company bought fifteen buildingmaterial centers in southern california from lone star industries which provided lp with much needed distribution centers a breakthrough productedit to ensure its longterm success however lp would need to compensate for its comparative dearth of southern pine and douglas fir timber as well as lumber production to address this shortfall lp turned its attention to the development of wood products derived from lessexpensive and fastergrowing trees such as cottonwood and aspen as merlo told the portland oregonian in  we recognized that the days of making wood products from big trees were numbered for both economic and environmental reasons in the late s the company began manufacturing osb by slicing logs into wafers mixing the wafers with resin and then pressing them into sheets first introduced under the trade name waferwood later rechristened innerseal this new product line revolutionized the construction industry by offering a less expensive stronger alternative to plywood sheathing and subflooring after opening its first innerseal mill in  lp advertised the product as the smart mans plywood expansion during the sedit lps osb products protected the company from some of the vicissitudes of the timber market buoyed by this success the company soon expanded its line of products made from reconstituted wood to include ibeams for floor joists and rafters these structural beams used half as much lumber as their solid wood counterparts yet were stronger and lighter lp also introduced a concrete form of innerseal and in  began to market innerseal siding for the exterior of homes driven by these breakthroughs a housing boom and a thriving remodeling and repair business that increased demand for its specialty building products lps sales grew  percent between  and  according to the portland oregonian during the same period its profits increased  percent moreover osb products accounted for an escalating portion of the companys total sales only six percent of sales in  the innerseal line by  amounted to almost  percent of total sales volume lps sales of lumber—once the mainstay of the building industry—decreased from  to  percent over the same period in  the company purchased kirby forest industries and the california properties of timber realization company from these transactions lp gained almost  acres of timberland which helped balance the land taken in  for redwood national park lp received a final payment of  million from the government for this land in  in  lp bought weather guard inc a manufacturer of housing insulation made from recycled newsprint as well as mitek wood products a north carolinabased producer of laminated veneer lumber and engineered wood ibeams the early sedit during  sales and profits in the companys softwood lumber plywood and building products areas slumped due to weakening demand this situation was attributed to an economic downturn increasing concerns over the us federal budget deficit and fears about the unsettled global geopolitical environment the construction industry suffered because of bankers reluctance to finance new projects and consumers decisions to delay home purchases housing starts for  fell to  million the lowest level since  and down  percent from  lp responded to these developments by curtailing production at many of its plants and increasing exports of its specialty building products the pulp market also experienced slowing growth in  after a fouryear period of rapidly rising prices pulp manufacturers then faced eroding profit margins due to worldwide economic problems and larger than normal inventories although lp saw its own pulp sales and profits peak in mid and expected only a minor recovery in  the company continued to operate three pulp manufacturing mills one mill supplied paper pulp to nonintegrated paper producers a second mill produced dissolving pulp for manufacturers of rayon and cellophane products the third and newest pulp mill using a bleached chemithermo mechanical pump process revolutionized pulp production by eliminating the use of chlorine and operated in a completely closed system without discharge into neighboring water supplies this mill marketed its output to manufacturers of printing and writing papers lp was able to rebound from the downturn of  while its competitors struggled in the face of dwindling timber supplies lp enjoyed record sales in   and  much of lps growth in the s came through acquisition of other building materials companies such as abtco in the eastern united states and forex in eastern canada according to the spokane journal of business lp was flourishing because it had vigorously developed alternatives to dimensional lumber and plywood indeed merlo told the wallstreet journal that technologynot oldgrowth timber resourceshad proven to be the companys lifeblood profits for  were up  percent from the previous year and in  the company achieved an alltime high of  billion in sales by that year only onethird of lps sales came from dimensional lumber—the studs and solid wood joists that frame houses—while over half its revenue came from osb products and another  percent from engineered wood products and pulp lawsuits threaten louisianapacifics futureedit despite its many achievements lp encountered a number of serious obstacles in the s foremost among these were lawsuits pertaining to its simulated cedar innerseal exterior siding during the s lp was the defendant in a major classaction lawsuit over its osb siding product known as inner seal manufactured from the early s through  the company had initiated the class action lawsuit to speed up the process and according to the judge presiding over the case got the most money to the most people in the quickest amount of time based on my experience many homeowners alleged that innerseal siding which carried a year warranty began to rot prematurely—discoloring disintegrating and even growing fungi the first claims surrounded the use of osb panels on the roofs of homes in florida following hurricane andrew in  some of these homes lost shingles exposing the osb panels to heavy rains reports claimed that the exposed osb began to deteriorate two years after the first suit lp had settled all related disputes lp reengineered the product now marketed as lpsmartside and since  has sold approximately  billion square feet of smartside siding with no warranty claims for fungal decay classaction suits brought by various collections of homeowners as well as the attorney general of minnesota were filed against the innerseal siding although lp admitted to no wrongdoing the company moved quickly to settle the cases at the close of  lp had paid over  million to settle osb claims and between  and  the company paid out an additional  million in  lp committed at least  million to a settlement with  homeowners who had used the innerseal siding in april  lp implemented a claimant offer program to speed payments to claimants in what was the largest classaction lawsuit in the history of the siding industry lp paid out more than  claims by the end of the settlement lp had paid almost  billion to satisfy claims lps woes did not end there however in  lp paid  million to settle a classaction lawsuit filed the previous year by lp shareholders who alleged that the company had violated securities laws by failing to disclose that the companys orientedstrand boards were defective as the portland oregonian reported on december   it was the largest securities settlement in oregon history also that year the company settled a  sexual harassment suit against merlo moreover the state of colorado brought a count indictment against lp in  charging fraud and environmental violations at its plant in montrose colorado the same year lps eightperson board lost confidence in the ability of merlo and his top two lieutenants to steer the fortune  company declared the august   edition of the portland oregonian merlo resigned and was replaced as chairman and ceo by mark suwyn a former executive at international paper rebuilding in the late sedit under this new leadership lp began the difficult task of regrouping the year  had been particularly difficult one in which the company endured a net loss of  million the market for building products had sunk as an influx of canadian lumber had flooded the united states high interest rates and poor weather which affected home building only exacerbated lps problems even more dangerous to lp however was the inauguration of several rival osb mills as osb increasingly replaced plywood as a basic construction material innerseal became less a specialty item exclusively made by lp and more of a building commodity faced with these new threats suwyn implemented a multidimensional plan for recovery first the company strove to eliminate unprofitable operations in  lp closed the ketchikan paper company as well as  plants and mills more closings followed in  and  and the company sold off a number of additional operations including the weatherseal door and window division in  all told lp sold over  million of assets during the threeyear period the assets sales will do two things for us suwyn told business wire they will provide us with additional financial flexibility to grow the company and allow us to focus all our management attention on becoming the premier supplier of building materials suwyn also concentrated on developing lps specialty products lines as its past innovations had become industry standards and were imitated by numerous competitors it was essential for lp to launch new products that would give the company an edge over its rivals to further this goal lp engaged in a series of targeted acquisitions in  lp purchased associated chemists a key supplier of specialty coatings to the wood products industry as well as greenstone industries a manufacturer of cellulose insulation and tecton laminates corp a producer of laminated veneer lumber and wood ijoists used in the construction industry two years later lp acquired abt building products corporation a transaction it heralded as a way to expand its specialty products lines and complement its lowcost commodity building products according to the wall street journal in  lp purchased evans forest products ltd a canadian manufacturer of engineered wood and lumber products lp did more than simply buy other companies however in  lp unveiled its advanced technology center which provided the company with the facilities to conceive test and improve new offerings lp soon introduced a bevy of new product systems including smart start siding techshield energy efficient structural panels topnotch flooring and cocoon insulation a final prong of lps rebuilding efforts involved improving operations in  the company instituted an intensive employee training course—rapid change technologies—designed to enhance workers communication skills and to empower them to accept new ideas with ease to increase productivity lp utilized business process improvement technology to make its osb mills more efficient lp also sought to bolster the companys relationship with large and national home center chains such as home depot and lowes these superstores represented the fastestgrowing segment of the building industry the outcome of lps vigorous reorganization was not immediately evident sales for  were  percent lower than in  and resulted in a net yearly loss of  million although the company again operated at a net loss of  million in  executives remained optimistic in  lp returned once more to profitability achieving  million of net profit from  billion in sales reinforced by a strong housing market a booming economy operational improvements and greater numbers of specialty products louisianapacifics future looked bright company

curtailing production at many of its plants and increasing exports of its specialty building products the pulp market also experienced slowing growth in  after a fouryear period of rapidly rising

expected only a minor recovery in  the company continued to operate three pulp manufacturing mills one mill supplied paper pulp to nonintegrated paper producers a second mill produced dissolving pulp for manufacturers of rayon and cellophane products the third and newest pulp mill using a bleached chemithermo mechanical pump process revolutionized pulp production by eliminating the use of chlorine

the downturn of  while its competitors struggled in the face of dwindling timber supplies lp enjoyed record sales in   and  much of lps growth in the s came through acquisition of other building materials companies such as abtco in the eastern united states and forex in eastern canada according to the spokane journal of business lp was flourishing because it had vigorously developed alternatives to dimensional lumber and plywood indeed merlo told the wallstreet journal that technologynot oldgrowth timber resourceshad proven to be the companys lifeblood profits for  were up  percent from the previous year and in  the company achieved an alltime high of  billion in sales by that year only onethird of lps sales came from dimensional lumber—the studs and solid wood joists that frame houses—while over half its revenue came from osb products and another  percent from engineered wood products and pulp lawsuits threaten louisianapacifics futureedit despite its many achievements lp encountered a number of serious obstacles in the s foremost among these were lawsuits pertaining to its simulated cedar innerseal exterior siding during the s lp was the defendant in a major classaction lawsuit over its osb siding product known as inner seal manufactured from the early s through  the company had initiated the class action lawsuit to speed up the process and according to the judge presiding over the case got the most money to the most people in the quickest amount of time based on my experience many homeowners alleged that innerseal siding which carried a year warranty began to rot prematurely—discoloring disintegrating and even growing fungi the first claims surrounded the use of osb panels on the roofs of homes in florida following hurricane andrew in  some of these homes lost shingles exposing the osb panels to heavy rains reports claimed that the exposed osb began to deteriorate two years after the first suit lp had settled all related disputes lp reengineered the product now marketed as lpsmartside and since  has sold approximately  billion square feet of smartside siding with no warranty claims for fungal decay classaction suits brought by various collections of homeowners as well as the attorney general of minnesota were filed against the innerseal siding although lp admitted to no wrongdoing the company moved quickly to settle the cases at the close of  lp had paid over  million to settle osb claims and between  and  the company paid out an additional  million in  lp committed at least  million to a settlement with  homeowners who had used the innerseal siding in april  lp implemented a claimant offer program to speed payments to claimants in what was the largest classaction lawsuit in the history of the siding industry lp paid out more than  claims by the end of the settlement lp had paid almost  billion to satisfy claims lps woes did not end there however in  lp paid  million to settle a classaction lawsuit filed the previous year by lp shareholders who alleged that the company had violated securities laws by failing to disclose that the companys orientedstrand boards were defective as the portland oregonian reported on december   it was the largest securities settlement in oregon history also that year the company settled a  sexual harassment suit against merlo moreover the state of colorado brought a count indictment against lp in  charging fraud and environmental violations at its plant in montrose colorado the same year lps eightperson board lost confidence in the ability of merlo and his top two lieutenants to steer the fortune  company declared the august   edition of the portland oregonian merlo resigned and was replaced as chairman and ceo by mark suwyn a former executive at international paper rebuilding in the late sedit under this new leadership lp began the difficult task of regrouping the year  had been particularly difficult one in which the company endured a net loss of  million the market for building products had sunk as an influx of canadian lumber had flooded the united states high interest rates and poor weather which affected home building only exacerbated lps problems even more dangerous to lp however was the inauguration of several rival osb mills as osb increasingly replaced plywood as a basic construction material innerseal became less a specialty item exclusively made by lp and more of a building commodity faced with these new threats suwyn implemented a multidimensional plan for recovery first the company strove to eliminate unprofitable operations in  lp closed the ketchikan paper company as well as  plants and mills more closings followed in  and  and the company sold off a number of additional operations including the weatherseal door and window division in  all told lp sold over  million of assets during the threeyear period the assets sales will do two things for us suwyn told business wire they will provide us with additional financial flexibility to grow the company and allow us to focus all our management attention on becoming the premier supplier of building materials suwyn also concentrated on developing lps specialty products lines as its past innovations had become industry standards and were imitated by numerous competitors it was essential for lp to launch new products that would give the company an edge over its rivals to further this goal lp engaged in a series of targeted acquisitions in  lp purchased associated chemists a key supplier of specialty coatings to the wood products industry as well as greenstone industries a manufacturer of cellulose insulation and tecton laminates corp a producer of laminated veneer lumber and wood ijoists used in the construction industry two years later lp acquired abt building products corporation a transaction it heralded as a way to expand its specialty products lines and complement its lowcost commodity building products according to the wall street journal in  lp purchased evans forest products ltd a canadian manufacturer of engineered wood and lumber products lp did more than simply buy other companies however in  lp unveiled its advanced technology center which provided the company with the facilities to conceive test and improve new offerings lp soon introduced a bevy of new product systems including smart start siding techshield energy efficient structural panels topnotch flooring and cocoon insulation a final prong of lps rebuilding efforts involved improving operations in  the company instituted an intensive employee training course—rapid change technologies—designed to enhance workers communication skills and to empower them to accept new ideas with ease to increase productivity lp utilized business process improvement technology to make its osb mills more efficient lp also sought to bolster the companys relationship with large and national home center chains such as home depot and lowes these superstores represented the fastestgrowing segment of the building industry the outcome of lps vigorous reorganization was not immediately evident sales for  were  percent lower than in  and resulted in a net yearly loss of  million although the company again operated at a net loss of  million in  executives remained optimistic in  lp returned once more to profitability achieving  million of net

engineered wood ibeams the early sedit during  sales and profits in the companys softwood lumber plywood and building products areas slumped due to weakening demand this situation was attributed to an economic downturn increasing concerns over the us federal budget deficit and fears about the unsettled global geopolitical environment the construction industry suffered because of bankers reluctance to finance new projects and consumers decisions to delay home purchases housing starts for  fell to  million the lowest level since  and down  percent from  lp responded to these developments by curtailing production at many of its plants and increasing exports of its specialty building products the pulp market also experienced slowing growth in  after a fouryear period of rapidly rising prices pulp manufacturers then faced eroding profit margins due to worldwide economic problems and larger than normal inventories although lp saw its own pulp sales and profits peak in mid and expected only a minor recovery in  the company continued to operate three pulp manufacturing mills one mill supplied paper pulp to nonintegrated paper producers a second mill produced dissolving pulp for manufacturers of rayon and cellophane products the third and newest pulp mill using a bleached chemithermo mechanical pump process revolutionized pulp production by eliminating the use of chlorine and operated in a completely closed system without discharge into neighboring water supplies this mill marketed its output to manufacturers of printing and writing papers lp was able to rebound from the downturn of  while its competitors struggled in the face of dwindling timber supplies lp enjoyed record sales in   and  much of lps growth in the s came through acquisition of other building materials companies such as abtco in the eastern united states and forex in eastern canada according to the spokane journal of business lp was flourishing because it had vigorously developed alternatives to dimensional lumber and plywood indeed merlo told the wallstreet journal that technologynot oldgrowth timber resourceshad proven to be the companys lifeblood profits for  were up  percent from the previous year and in  the company achieved an alltime high of  billion in sales by that year only onethird of lps sales came from dimensional lumber—the studs and solid wood joists that frame houses—while over half its revenue came from osb products and another  percent from engineered wood products and pulp lawsuits threaten louisianapacifics futureedit despite its many achievements lp encountered a number of serious obstacles in the s foremost among these were lawsuits pertaining to its simulated cedar innerseal exterior siding during the s lp was the defendant in a major classaction lawsuit over its osb siding product known as inner seal manufactured from the early s through  the company had initiated the class action lawsuit to speed up the process and according to the judge presiding over the case got the most money to the most people in the quickest amount of time based on my experience many homeowners alleged that innerseal siding which carried a year warranty began to rot prematurely—discoloring disintegrating and even growing fungi the first claims surrounded the use of osb panels on the roofs of homes in florida following hurricane andrew in  some of these homes lost shingles exposing the osb panels to heavy rains reports claimed that the exposed osb began to deteriorate two years after the first suit lp had settled all related disputes lp reengineered the product now marketed as lpsmartside and since  has sold approximately  billion square feet of smartside siding with no warranty claims for fungal decay classaction suits brought by various collections of homeowners as well as the attorney general of minnesota were filed against the innerseal siding although lp admitted to no wrongdoing the company moved quickly to settle the cases at the close of  lp had paid over  million to settle osb claims and between  and  the company paid out an additional  million in  lp committed at least  million to a settlement with  homeowners who had used the innerseal siding in april  lp implemented a claimant offer program to speed payments to claimants in what was the largest classaction lawsuit in the history of the siding industry lp paid out more than  claims by the end of the settlement lp had paid almost  billion to satisfy claims lps woes did not end there however in  lp paid  million to settle a classaction lawsuit filed the previous year by lp shareholders who alleged that the company had violated securities laws by failing to disclose that the companys orientedstrand boards were defective as the portland oregonian reported on december   it was the largest securities settlement in oregon history also that year the company settled a  sexual harassment suit against merlo moreover the state of colorado brought a count indictment against lp in  charging fraud and environmental violations at its plant in montrose colorado the same year lps eightperson board lost confidence in the ability of merlo and his top two lieutenants to steer the fortune  company declared the august   edition of the portland oregonian merlo resigned and was replaced as chairman and ceo by mark suwyn a former executive at international paper rebuilding in the late sedit under this new leadership lp began the difficult task of regrouping the year  had been particularly difficult one in which the company endured a net loss of  million the market for building products had sunk as an influx of canadian lumber had flooded the united states high interest rates and poor weather which affected home building only exacerbated lps problems even more dangerous to lp however was the inauguration of several rival osb mills as osb increasingly replaced plywood as a basic construction material innerseal became less a specialty item exclusively made by lp and more of a building commodity faced with these new threats suwyn implemented a multidimensional plan for recovery first the company strove to eliminate unprofitable operations in  lp closed the ketchikan paper company as well as  plants and mills more closings followed in  and  and the company sold off a number of additional operations including the weatherseal door and window division in  all told lp sold over  million of assets during the threeyear period the assets sales will do two things for us suwyn told business wire they will provide us with additional financial flexibility to grow the company and allow us to focus all our management attention on becoming the premier supplier of building materials suwyn also concentrated on developing lps specialty products lines as its past innovations had become industry standards and were imitated by numerous competitors it was essential for lp to launch new products that would give the company an edge over its rivals to further this goal lp engaged in a series of targeted acquisitions in  lp purchased associated chemists a key supplier of specialty coatings to the wood products industry as well as greenstone industries a manufacturer of cellulose insulation and tecton laminates corp a producer of laminated veneer lumber and wood ijoists used in the construction industry two years later lp acquired abt building products corporation a transaction it heralded as a way to expand its specialty products lines and complement its lowcost commodity building products according to the wall street journal in  lp purchased evans forest products ltd a canadian manufacturer of engineered wood and lumber products lp did more than simply buy other companies however in  lp unveiled its advanced technology center which provided the company with the facilities to conceive test and improve new offerings lp soon introduced a bevy of new product systems including smart start siding techshield energy efficient structural panels topnotch flooring and cocoon insulation a final prong of lps rebuilding efforts involved improving operations in  the company instituted an intensive employee training course—rapid change technologies—designed to enhance workers communication skills and to empower them to accept new ideas with ease to increase productivity lp utilized business process improvement technology to make its osb mills more efficient lp also sought to bolster the companys relationship with large and national home center chains such as home depot and lowes these superstores represented the fastestgrowing segment of the building industry the outcome of lps vigorous reorganization was not immediately evident sales for  were  percent lower than in  and resulted in a net yearly loss of  million although the company again operated at a net loss of  million in  executives remained optimistic in  lp returned once more to profitability achieving  million of net profit from  billion in sales reinforced by a strong housing market a booming economy operational improvements and greater numbers of specialty products louisianapacifics future looked bright company

inspections for lp or hardboard siding in nw washington hardboard or composite wood sidings are made from various combinations of wood veneers fibers or flakes bound together with glues resins andor waxes they come with different names lp siding t  plywood oriented strand board osb and hardboard are basic engineered wood siding materials several different types and brands of engineered wood siding have experienced moisturerelated failures due to product or installation defects or improper maintenance for the purpose of this article we will refer to these products as composite siding generally speaking homeowners with siding installed after  will have fewer problems than those installed prior to that there have been many class action suits against the manufacturers of earlier product for many homeowners the time has passed to receive any compensation from the class action suits however most of the composite products did have a warranty and manufacturers such as louisiana pacific are paying warranty claims while louisiana pacific lp was the most publicized there were many other companies who also made this type of siding siding manufactured from oriented strand board and other wood composites have the advantage of being manufactured from relatively low cost wood and young trees thus saving money and attempting at a more benign impact on the environment such siding products became more attractive as traditional wood siding decreased in quality andor increases in cost unfortunately most of the experience with such siding products have been poor most of these products have experienced moisture related problems many homes in the nw washington have been sided with composite or osb siding these products have  been problematic  in the nw washington due to lack of maintenance the weather and moisture conditions locally used manufacturers louisiana pacificomniboardmasonitegeorgia pacificweyerhaeuserlouisiana pacific at the forefront of siding problems in the nw washington is a product called “louisiana pacific” or “lp” inner seal siding there was a class action suit filed against the louisiana pacific siding covering individuals who installed the product prior to january   the class action suit does not cover lp inner seal siding installed after january   louisiana pacific sold two basic types of lp inner seal siding “lap” or horizontal siding and lp inner seal panel siding many people refer to the panel siding as t this is not a correct reference as t siding is a true plywood siding and it is made quite differently from the lp inner seal siding and has held up better than the older lp siding if you need more information on the warranty claims your can call their claim line at  when you put in a warranty claim it will take about  days for them to send out an inspector you can realistically expect that it will take from one year to two years from the date of inspection to the date that you will actually receive your claim check the amount of time it will take from date of inspection to date of check could change but we expect it to get worse and not better over the next few months omniboardomni board is another product that people in the nw washington are having problems with the omniboard product is very similar to the louisiana pacific product in that it is a type of “chip board” or composite product omniboard like louisiana pacific sold both “lap” and “panel” siding however unlike the louisiana pacific panels we do not always suggest that you side over these panels the omniboard panels tend to bow more than the louisiana pacific panels as a result of the bowing material set on top of the omniboard panels do not always sit flat and can give the home the appearance of being “out of square” caution is the better part of valor when siding over the omniboard panels you may call the omniboard claim line at  it should only take you from  months to  months for omniboard to settle your claim dealing with omniboard is much easier than louisiana pacific at this time it is important to note that there is not a class action suit on the omniboard product the company is handling the claims under their warranty programmasonitemasonite hard board – masonite – did have a class action suit filed the hard board siding was not used a great deal in the pacific northwest but you do find it from time to time most of the masonite hard board siding came in panel form on expensive homes you might find the masonite “clad board” this is where masonite covered the composite siding with a “stucco” appearing material this material was used on houses where people wanted to have a “tutor” looking home if you have masonite hard board siding you may call their claim line at georgia pacificgeorgia pacific corporation recently settled a class action suit regarding their jarratt lap siding and catawba siding catawba was used a great deal in nw washington when louisiana pacific started having problems with their siding you may call the georgia pacific corporation claims line at weyerhaeuserweyerhaeuser brand hardboard siding is an exterior composite wood siding made from wood fiber mixed primarily with resin and wax and pressed under extreme pressure and heat into dense panels using different plate designs these panels can have different textures the panels can then be cut into long horizontal lap siding or into sheets to make panel siding most weyerhaeuser composite siding is designed with a cedar woodgrain texture other textures include a stucco texture smooth lap siding a cedar shake texture or a crosssawn wood texture since these textures are very realistic it can be difficult to tell them apart from other kinds of siding there may be repeating features such as knots spaced ″ apart or a “double knot” feature with two nonidentical knots spaced  ″ apart if you can see the back most styles contain the marking “aha ” or “aha ” new class action suit filed in june  for claims

product has been improved and seems to be exhibiting fewer problems fibercement productsfibercement siding has the look of wood siding but has a lower cost and lower maintenance market share is approaching ten percent according to manufacturers most newly constructed homes with lap siding with have this type of siding additional benefits include resistance to termites and fire fibercement siding will not rot buckle or warp and holds paint for several years longer than conventional wood siding moisture resistance is a concern but problems can be avoided if the siding is installed correctly and properly treated listed below are a few of the most common installation defects that i find  the funny thing about these installation defects is that the installation instructions are very clear and very specific – the diagrams below all come directly from james hardie  the other manufacturers of fiber cement siding have nearly identical installation instructions improper clearances must be kept ″ away from roof surfaces decks driveways steps and other similar hard surfaces must be kept ″ above the finished grade gutters must be kept ″ away from the siding and kickout flashing needs to be installed must be kept ″ above flashing above windows and not caulked at the z flashing improperly attached must be blind nailed or face nailed but not both  the photos below show blind nails and face nails used together and clearly shows what happens the proper size nails must be used d or siding nails  framing nails d were used in the photos below the nails must be driven in straight and must not be overdriven or underdriven  the nails pictured were driven at an angle or driven in too far jameshardie company certain teedmaxitilejameshardie company this product appears to

maxitilemaxitile manufacture maxipanel maxiplank and maxishake productsnot sure what you have siding solutions identification page composite siding maintenancesome of the pre  versions of the lp and similar siding products failed soon after installation later versions have lasted longer but as of the fall of  we have yet to see such a product that stands up in our wet pacific northwest climate unless it is vigilantly maintained the most common conditions which seems to warrant some “preventative” maintenance and eventual replacement are limited swelling and thin cracks along the bottom edge of the siding see the first picture below for an example of this condition regular application of a good quality exterior paint is critical to successfully maintaining composite siding although one would expect the area painter to know the areas of composite siding that needs special attention we have seen enough poor applied or sloppy paint jobs that a gentle reminder is in order make sure that all joints are caulked and that paint is sprayed up into the overlaps of the siding many painter tend to spray “straight ahead” however the areas that really need the paint are the bottom edges and directly behind the bottom edge see the pictures below for examples other maintenance practices quality caulking of any dimpled nail heads abuttment joints any areas where water may sit or pool and around fixtures such as lights or hose bibs priming with parker “flex bind” pittsburgh “permenizer plus” or similar primer material note brushing the primer into the bottom edge of the siding is a critical element of this work keeping vegetation soil roof drainage and sprinkler water off the siding make sure sheathing has at least ″ clearance where to roof and side walls of the home join together these joints are normally covered by trim and not exposed painting is unlikely to solve all of the problems with this type of siding or help with severely deteriorated material but it should prolong the life of the product examples of siding issues early deterioration and warping note fungus growing on bottom edge different angle of same siding delaminating around nailing point closeup of delamination or checking soft spot deterioration tothe point where siding crumbles edge checking and swelling although each manufacturers product varies slightly thebottom edges should be around

initially i would qualify the age if it was manufactured prior  it may be first generation products which had a higher rate of failure to if there are any signs of the composite siding failing we advise getting it evaluated before purchasing a home why when you buy the home the siding issues are now yours to deal with it takes your time and your money once you own the home in most areas like the pacific northwest composite siding has a finite lifespan like a roof does it takes meticulous maintenance of the siding to extend its life beyond twenty years this is the “short answer” to “should i buy a home with lp siding on it” as with all things it’s entirely your call well unless you are getting financing the short answersshould i buy a home with lp siding on it if i’m paying cash i wouldn’t unless you own a siding company or have the repair costs deducted and have some spare time on your hands get the lp siding issues fixed first should i buy a home with lp siding on it if i’m getting financing you may not have a choice if there are any signs of lp siding rot delamination or failing the chances of passing inspection are very slim and if the home fails inspection for lp siding issues many lending companies will not approve your financing – hence you may not have a choice i have failing composite siding what should i dothe short answer the sooner you get it fixed the better if your lp siding is already showing signs of rot delaminating fungus mold swelling mushrooms or separation – it’s just a matter of time before you have a real problem on your hands your first step should be to get a unbiased opinion on the extent of the damage you may want to call a contractor but remember they are in the business of replacing siding and can be biased you will be better off with a certified siding inspector such as pacific crest inspections we can gauge the extend of the damage using industry guidelines to determine the extent of the repairs needed stabilize in many cases the deterioration has begun and but still within the industry guidelines so replacement isn’t warranted yet your best bet is to stabilize by cleaning recaulking and painting the siding you may still end up replacing the siding but can postpone that investment by aggressively maintaining it replacement most siding companies pull off all of the lp lap product and install new hardiplank vinyl or cedar however some siding companies reside over the lp panel siding instead of pulling the panel material off this process can have cost benefits but prior to siding over the panels you should look to see how much damage there is to the panels if the damage is too severe we do not suggest siding over the panels additionally in many cases we do not suggest siding over the panels with vinyl most builders placed either osb or plywood behind the “lap siding” so if you take off a piece of lap siding you have another protective layer of material before you get to the cavity of your wall the panel siding is what we call a “single wall construction” type product if you pull off a piece of panel siding it will immediately open up the cavity of your wall you will be able to see your wiring insulation plumbing etc this is one of the reasons so many siders suggest siding over the panel siding by siding over the panel siding it gives you a second layer of protection thus the terms… “single wall construction” panels only and “double wall construction” lap siding followed by a layer of plywood or chipboard we do not suggest that you side over any panels that are seriously damaged usually the most damaged panels can be found in the noninsulated areas of your fireplace chimney or over the garage entrance chipboard products are often called “osb” – oriented strand board some siding companies claim that you cannot put vinyl over hardboard siding not true according the the national association of home builders liquid vinyl siding – the answer to your siding problems liquid vinyl siding problems are recent since liquid vinyl is a relatively new exterior coating unlike vinyl siding liquid vinyl is a sprayon viscous coating that can be applied to any paintable surface it dries to the touch in minutes but requires about three weeks to set however if you hardboard siding is damaged or moisture laden liquid vinyl may not adhere and properly protect your siding as with any exterior vinyl product whether siding or coating the surface to be covered must be in perfect condition preparation of the surface and installation are critical to the prevention of problems moisture has been the central issue in siding products and that leads back to proper treatment of the substrate and installation that meets known standards for liquid vinyl installation instructions for liquid vinyl are wellknown but not always followed any underlying mildew dry rot or mold must be removed from the substrate if necessary any defective area must be replaced no imperfection in stucco or wood can be overlooked if faulty installation leads to future problems with moisture mold lawsuits will be among the litigation that follows after sanding caulking and scraping a primer is applied that is a bonding agent last comes the liquid vinyl coating this elastic waterresistant coating is a breathable film that eliminates moisture and is guaranteed for  years if however preparation of the substrate and actual construction standards are not maintained moisturerelated liquid vinyl siding problems can develop and building product lawsuits will result many of the companies who install this product are subcontractors or independent companies and their experience will vary ask how many times they have applied this product and what issues they have seen  i would always do a check with the better business bureau and ask for at least three reference customers to talk to ask the builder article on liquid siding tankless water heaters   selling tankless water heater in us skip to main
