following a review of the results of exploration on the gem tenement the company decided to relinquish the exploration license the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” which contemplates continuation of consolidated gems as a going concern the company has not yet commenced

after such determination will be capitalized the establishment of proven and probable reserves is based on results of final feasibility studies which indicate whether a property is economically feasible upon commencement of commercial production capitalized costs will be transferred to the appropriate asset category and amortized over their estimated useful lives capitalized costs net of salvage values relating to a deposit which is abandoned or considered uneconomic for the foreseeable future will be written off mineral rights are amortized over their estimated useful lives being the
