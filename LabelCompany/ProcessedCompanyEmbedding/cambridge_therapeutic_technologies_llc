trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement contraindicationssystemic fungal infections and known hypersensitivity to components warningsin patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before during and after the stressful situation is indicated corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection and new infections may appear during their use there may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses usage in pregnancy since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids the use of these drugs in pregnancy nursing mothers or women of childbearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure salt and water retention and increased excretion of potassium these effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary all corticosteroids increase calcium excretion while on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids especially on high dose because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response the use of prednisone tablets usp in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen if corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur during prolonged corticosteroid therapy these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals chickenpox and measles for example can have a more serious or even fatal course in nonimmune children or adults on corticosteroids in such children or adults who have not had these diseases particular care should be taken to avoid exposure how the dose route and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known the contribution of the underlying disease andor prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known if exposed to chickenpox prophylaxis with varicellazoster immune globulin vzig may be indicated if exposed to measles prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin ig may be indicated see the respective package inserts for complete vzig and ig prescribing information if chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered precautions general precautions druginduced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage this type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy therefore in any situation of stress occurring during that period hormone therapy should be reinstituted since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired salt andor a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently there is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation the lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment and when reduction in dosage is possible the reduction should be gradual psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used ranging from euphoria insomnia mood swings personality changes and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations also existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis if there is a probability of impending perforation abscess or other pyogenic infection diverticulitis fresh intestinal anastomoses active or latent peptic ulcer renal insufficiency hypertension osteoporosis and myasthenia gravis growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease the studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect see dosage and administration since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment a riskbenefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporine since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur information for patients persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles patients should also be advised that if they are exposed medical advice should be sought without delay adverse reactions fluid and electrolyte disturbances sodium retention fluid retention congestive heart failure in susceptible patients

glaucoma exophthalmos additional reactions urticaria and other allergic anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions dosage and administrationthe initial dosage of prednisone tablets usp may vary from  mg to  mg prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated in situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required the initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted if after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy it should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient after a favorable response is noted the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached it should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process the patient’s individual drug responsiveness and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition if after longterm therapy the drug is to be stopped it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly multiple sclerosis in the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of  mg of prednisolone for a week followed by  mg every other day for  month have been shown to be effective dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone adt ® alternate day therapy adt is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning the purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring longterm pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects including pituitaryadrenal suppression the cushingoid state corticoid withdrawal symptoms and growth suppression in children the rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises a the antiinflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and b administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for reestablishment of more nearly normal hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa activity on the offsteroid day a brief review of the hpa physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin acth while a rise in free cortisol inhibits acth secretion normally the hpa system is characterized by diurnal circadian rhythm serum levels of acth rise from a low point about  pm to a peak level about  am increasing levels of acth stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between  am and  am this rise in cortisol dampens acth production and in turn adrenocortical activity there is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight the diurnal rhythm of the hpa axis is lost in cushing’s disease a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution thinning of the skin with easy bruisability muscle wasting with weakness hypertension latent diabetes osteoporosis electrolyte imbalance etc the same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during longterm pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses it would appear then that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects during conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy acth production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex recovery time for normal hpa activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment during this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone  mg as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every  hours there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used further it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days other corticoids including methylprednisolone hydrocortisone prednisone and prednisolone are considered to be short acting producing adrenocortical suppression for  ¼ to  ½ days following a single dose and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy the following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy  basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply the benefits of adt should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids adt is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom longterm pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated in less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated it may be possible to initiate treatment with adt more severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process the initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases it is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended once control has been established two courses are available a change to adt and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or b following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule theoretically course a may be preferable because of the advantages of adt it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time eg patients with rheumatoid arthritis since these patients may already have a suppressed hpa axis establishing them on adt may be difficult and not always successful however it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over it may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered once the patient is again controlled an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum as indicated above certain corticosteroids because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity are not recommended for alternate day therapy eg dexamethasone and betamethasone the maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between  am and  am and it is minimal between  pm and midnight exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least when given at the time of maximal activity am in using adt it is important as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients an explanation of the benefits of adt will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flareup in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the offsteroid day other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed in the event of an acute flareup of the disease process it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control once control is again established alternate day therapy may be reinstituted although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by adt as in any therapeutic situation the physician must carefully weigh the benefitrisk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered share this drug information
