team that i believe in fact is unmatched in the media industry now for our results i hope youve had the opportunity to see our news release which was issued earlier today im very pleased to report record first quarter fiscal  earnings of  per share that compares to  in the prior year period excluding special items in the prior year first quarter fiscal  earnings per share grew by  total company revenues increased  to a record  million while total advertising revenue increased  to  million first quarter fiscal  performance was characterized by four key elements first of all strong growth in local media group revenue operating profit and ebitda driven by record political advertising and retransmission related revenue in addition local digital advertising revenues increased by more than  second national media group digital advertising revenues increased  digital advertising revenues accounted for nearly  of total national media group revenue in the quarter third our continued efforts to expand connection with the individual consumer across merediths media platforms magazine readership continues at an impressive  million monthly readers traffic to our digital and mobile sites grew  to an average of  million monthly unique visitors additionally our television stations delivered a strong july rating book and finally ongoing execution of our total shareholder return strategy that continues to emphasize organic growth investments to scale our reach and strong cash flow generation looking more specifically at operating highlights for the quarter we renewed our licensing agreement with walmart for three additional years and that relates to our line of over  skus of better homes and gardens branded product at more than  walmart stores and of course on walmartcom we introduced a slate of new original digital video program based on several of our leading brands including shape allrecipes better homes and gardens martha stewart living and parents all feature millennial celebrities and influencers we unveiled a new broadcast television series based on allrecipes dinner spinner app that reaches over  million us households weekly with nearly  million downloads dinner spinner is already the worlds most popular recipe planning app the new dinner spinner show is sponsored by panasonic and is being promoted across all of merediths media platforms and finally we launched magnolia journal a new lifestyle magazine with popular hgtv television hosts chip and joanna gaines its delivering both strong consumer and advertiser response magnolia journal carries a premium cover price and inaugural advertisers include american standard kohler and conagra now looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal  we expect earnings per share to range from  to  driven by strong political advertising that will be partially offset by weaker nonpolitical back in latejuly we said that we expect to generate between  million and  million of political advertising in this cycle with less than two weeks to go before the election we in fact expect to finish well within that range and higher than the results recorded in the previous election cycle now ill turn the discussion over to chief financial officer joe ceryanec for more on our quarterly performance and additional details on our outlook for the second quarter and for full fiscal  joseph h ceryanec  meredith corp thanks steve and good morning everybody ill begin with our local media group operating group performance operating profit grew more than  to  million and ebitda grew more than  to  million revenue growth was strong up more than  to  million and all of these financial represent first quarter records political ad revenues were  million up more than  from the first quarter in the last political cycle most of our political revenues were driven by socalled downballot races such as us senate and house elections gubernatorial contests and local races spending is particularly heavy in las vegas driven by the presidential election a close us senate race to replace the retiring harry reid and by two tight races for the us house its also heavy in missouri where theres an open seat for governor and where senator roy blunt is in a tight race for reelection this is benefiting us at the three stations we own and operate in the st louis and kansas city markets in phoenix where we have two stations senator john mccain is in a closerthanexpected race for reelection and there are two other hotly contested house races as well as other competitive downballot races and referendums as we said on our call in july presidential election spending historically represents only about  of our total political revenue and in fact it was only  in our first fiscal quarter turning to nonpolitical advertising revenues were down  to  million during the quarter we saw political crowdout in certain of the markets i mentioned and the summer olympic games on nbc also impacted many of our markets of our  markets nashville is the only one where we have an nbc affiliate it definitely benefited from the olympics generating more than  increase in nonpolitical revenues other revenues and expenses both increased during the fiscal year primarily due to growth in retransmissionrelated revenues that we get from the mvpds and higher programming fees paid to the networks we expect to see continued growth in other revenues throughout fiscal  as we will be renegotiating  of our subscriber base in fiscal  while our existing network affiliation agreements remain in place now turning to the national media group fiscal  first quarter operating profit was  million and revenues were  million operating expenses declined  as we continue to pursue operational efficiencies total advertising revenues were  million including a  increase in digital advertising revenues reported ad revenue was down  but excluding the impact of more ad revenues were actually even with the prior year digital advertising revenue was driven by both direct sales and programmatic on the direct sales side were seeing success at creating proprietary ad products based on our premium brands which is allowing us to build larger and more longterm partnerships with our clients on the programmatic side were seeing improvement in rates in our private and open marketplace as well as the results of investments weve made in the last  months in technology data capabilities as well as talent turning to magazine advertising we increased our share of total magazine advertising revenue to  from  according to the most recent data from the publishers information bureau shape rachael ray every day eatingwell and allrecipes delivered noteworthy advertising revenue growth from a category perspective prescription drug food and direct response categories were stronger looking at circulation revenues were  million and circulation profit contribution increased in the lowsingle digits newsstand revenues were up subscription revenues declined due primarily to the closure of more magazine as well as our ongoing efforts to source magazine subscribers from our own database instead of external agent sources this strategy increases circulation profit but lowers revenue over time and we expect these factors to continue to increase to affect circulation results through the rest of fiscal  finally in the first quarter of  along with the renewal of our license program with walmart we debuted three new licensing programs first a line of healthy food entrees under the eatingwell brand with bellisio foods that is selling very well in grocery stores and box stores across the country next a collection of clothing under our shape brand thats now available in department stores and sporting goods retailers womens athletic retailers and gym chains such as equinox and power life yoga and third we launched a line of cookware under the allrecipes brand thats currently available on amazon its also featured in the dinner spinner television show as well now as we look at the company wide financial highlights our cash flow from operations was up very strong in the quarter and grew to  million from  million in the prior year period total debt was  million our weighted average interest rate was  with effectively half of our debt fixed at low rates and our leverage ratio was  times for the trailing  months now as we look at our outlook as steve mentioned we continue to expect full year  earnings per share to range from  to  we expect our fiscal  second quarter earnings to range from  to  and that compares to  or  before special items that we recorded in the prior year second quarter and as we look more closely at the second quarter of fiscal  compared to the prior year we expect local media group revenues to be up approximately  and this increase includes expected political ad revenues between  million and  million partially offset by weaker nonpolitical ad revenues we expect total national media group revenues to be down in the lowsingle digits and total company revenues to be up in the midtohigh single digits with that ill turn it back to steve to close and then well open it up for qa stephen mark lacy  meredith corp thank you very much joe let me close with what we continue to believe is a very compelling investment thesis for the meredith corporation the diverse businesses that we own and operate produce consistently strong free cash flow thats driven by a great group of television stations in large and faster growing markets trusted national brands with an unrivaled reach to american women particularly the growing reach to the upcoming millennial generation a profitable and growing digital business a vibrant and growing brand licensing activities thats based on our very strong national media brands and again a strong improvement management team with a very successful record of generating strong free cash flow and growing shareholder value over time so with those remarks we would be happy to answer any questions that you might have questionandanswer session operator well first go to the line of kyle evans with stephens go ahead kyle evans  stephens inc hi good morning thanks stephen mark lacy  meredith corp hey kyle kyle evans  stephens inc hi maybe we could start with the nonpolitical core in lmg you posted a down  and youre talking about weaker trends relative to your guidance for the current quarter could you help us dive down you talked a little bit about olympics you talked a little bit about political displacement help us think about that going forward please stephen mark lacy  meredith corp yeah well ill start kyle and then ill ask paul to give us some color its a very unusual season with a lot of clutter in the marketplace and as joe mentioned we had olympics in this quarter and that only impacted us in our nashville property and again along with a little bit of a crazy political season so we had the combination of some displacement not as much benefit from olympics as we might had hoped and also just some advertisers who were sitting out sort of waiting for the dust to clear if you will im going to ask joe to give maybe some category results on nonpolitical the stronger ones and the weaker ones and then im going to ask paul just to give some general color from the marketplace as hes out talking to our sellers and also to our customers joseph h ceryanec  meredith corp so kyle another fact i mentioned there were four markets where we had strong political and that was las vegas the two missouri markets and phoenix and ironically if you took those four markets out the rest of our markets were basically flat for the quarter so as steve said its a little hard to sort through it all because of olympics and the presidential but i would say remove the political and we probably werent as bad as down  for the group to steves point some of the nontraditional categories maybe were a little bit stronger we saw pharma stronger on the lmg side gaming gambling were up auto was down it was down  restaurants professional services again which were some of the larger categories were also down as well and ill let paul pile on but as were into the second quarter again were in the heat of the political season so its a little hard to look at pacings and figure out where were going to end the quarter but were continuing to see softness so far as whats on the books but paul you can add some color paul a karpowicz  meredith corp yeah i think you and steve actually hit on it i think as an industry probably going back a year ago we probably did ourselves a disservice to the extent that we talked so much about how big a political year this was shaping up to be and i think we scared off a lot of our traditional advertisers who have said and ive spoken to many advertisers who said look i just didnt want to get in the middle of all this activity in september october november and the expectation is that they will be back but i think thats a lot of what were seeing and as you spend time in las vegas or phoenix or st louis or kansas city and you look at what were running literally it is every other spot is a political ad which is kind of tough for the viewers but for our political revenues its great but i think for traditional advertisers theyre looking at that crowd out and just saying okay i just dont want to mess with it so well see we have a very aggressive plan in place on the lmg side relative to life after political so life after november  were going to be incredibly aggressive to make sure that we get those advertisers back and build the core back up to where it needs to be stephen mark lacy  meredith corp does that help kyle kyle evans  stephens inc it does i have one quick followup on that auto down  what would – this is maybe too granular but what might that number have looked like if you excluded those four political hot markets stephen mark lacy  meredith corp we dont have that level of detail here but we can get it for you kyle and we will kyle evans  stephens inc thank you stephen mark lacy  meredith corp thank you operator and well go next to the line of dan kurnos with benchmark your line is open stephen mark lacy  meredith corp good morning dan how you doing dan l kurnos  the benchmark co llc good morning steve im doing all right stephen mark lacy  meredith corp great dan l kurnos  the benchmark co llc just – ill switch gears here im sure a bunch of people are going to pile in on the tv side so ill ask a couple of national questions can you just talk about steve obviously the magnolia has been sort of a pleasant surprise for you guys not a needle mover but i kind of want to get a sense from you highlevel about how youre thinking about and this is sort of an ongoing conversation right how youre thinking about content in terms of being able to now leverage national media as a distribution platform and it seems like thats becoming more and more of a partnership opportunity versus buying a new title or two and then also versus developing organic lets just start there stephen mark lacy  meredith corp yeah and im going to start and im going to ask tom to add his point of view and then also jon werther a bit on the digital side in all sincerity dan what we see continuing to happen are individual businesses if you think about martha stewart living if you think about our ability to pick up shape and then if we move to the gaines opportunity with magnolia people coming to meredith and i would really say for three primary reasons first and foremost a very very stable and secure leadership team that they feel comfortable handing their brand over to obviously the magnolia brand belongs to them but we are executing it in the media marketplace very much like what we do for martha in addition to that we have a very very broad reach multiplatform with now  of adult millennial women that we serve so we are a very very attractive distribution platform but i think more important than that you think of rachael ray you think of martha you think of chip and joanna theyre very concerned about who they hand their brand over to and we take good care of those relationships and so we have quite a bit of inbound and tom im going to ask you to talk about how we evaluate those opportunities because obviously this is a forprofit business activity for us and then ill come back and ask jon to talk about how we think about those opportunities digital so tom go ahead thomas h harty  meredith corp sure i think its – on the consumer side what were still seeing and have been seeing over the last few years its not digital or print the consumers want both platforms and are using them different so we like to say that we are creating content no matter how she wants to consume that being on her iphone or desktop or in print and opportunities like magnolia where you have an established brand whos in their medium on hgtv we really got excited about this from the beginning and our team kind of quickly in a matter of three months put out a product on the newsstand and just shows you the good news is we announced last week that we actually have to go back to press to print more copies to get them out on the newsstand for such a high demand that were seeing so we have that from a magnolia perspective and then youll remember four years ago that we started allrecipes magazine where we had the largest brand allrecipes on the web for food content and we started we looked at it we did consumer research and we found that there was an opportunity for a magazine and we produced that and within  months we were profitable and now we have a whole new profit stream with a new platform in print for an allrecipes brand so its – we look at these opportunities on an ongoing basis but on the consumer side what we continue to see is theres both demand for print and for online content stephen mark lacy  meredith corp and jon when we – if you would speak to how these new brand opportunities shape and martha in particular from a premium content perspective and a distribution digitally how the digital sales and marketing team are taking those to the marketplace jon werther  meredith corp sure whether its buying a new asset or developing experiences organically or structuring partnerships we think weve been very successful particularly on the digital side with the development of multiplatform content led experiences and distributing that content wherever consumers are as tom highlighted in addition weve been successful at generating strong engagement as well as strong results for advertisers through our branded experiences the firstparty data that were able to leverage as part of those experiences and the technology platforms that we purchase to fuel premium advertising products the collective result of those assets is that were able to drive reach and engagement growth and great results for our advertising partners and for the partners with whom we work on these experiences and ultimately do so profitably so content really is what we look at to lead these experiences and we found that to be very successful in terms of establishing alwayson partnerships with our clients across platforms and do so profitably stephen mark lacy  meredith corp does that help dan dan l kurnos  the benchmark co llc yeah thats a good high level i just wanted to followup then on kind of how mxm still fits into the picture here because i think that was maybe again a little bit disappointing to us so if you could just talk to that and then steve just lastly for you on the program side with the walmart renewal without giving away any competitive secrets if you could just talk about if that was an expanded deal and just how we should think about the rollout of the new programs and the impact understanding that these things take a long time to be recognized on the pl stephen mark lacy  meredith corp yeah so again the best way dan to think of mxm what tom just described and what jon just described that we do for our own brands we execute very similarly situated programs for brands that our advertising and marketing clients own because every single one of our key marketers is also in the media business with their own web properties with their own outbound email distribution and in many cases with printed properties that we create if you will on a white label basis i think the real proof point around mxm will be where we are as we turn the corner into  because youre right the results were not what any of us had hoped but interestingly enough this is probably the largest pipeline of potential new business opportunities in many many many years now in this quarter this fourth calendar quarter and into the early part of  is when those deals get signed and the statements of work get executed or they dont so stealing a line from paul karpowicz i am cautiously optimistic about calendar  for mxm but we have to prove that to ourselves and to our shareholders and were not there at this point but tom you might speak just a bit to the sales leadership thats there and obviously the trick on this dan is these are situations where we cant give the name of the company until they give us permission and oftentimes that is because were executing a program for them to try to give them a competitive advantage and they dont want us to talk about it but you might give a sense tom of some of the things that are going on in that space that i think give us all some cause for optimism thomas h harty  meredith corp yeah about a year ago we named georgine anton to the leadership position of mxm and georgine really is a seller at heart so shes the leader now and has kind of changed the mindset we felt we had to build to steves point our pipeline of sales with new relationships and not just grow existing customers and georgine has taken the last  months and has really doubled the number of people that are in our sales organization going out and selling so were very cautiously optimistic about the pipeline that were seeing with lots of new customers and then theres also a huge benefit what we like to do is were very unique in this space compared to our competitors is that when we go in to talk to these clients at a very senior level cmo president level were a media company but then we also have this very large marketing services organization so we can really come with a unique perspective and actually help them solve some problems and then also execute on the media perspective so its very unique compared to some of our competitors in the marketplace stephen mark lacy  meredith corp and last but not least dan on licensing we were elated to renew our program with walmart and there are again about  products in store but i would say in this renewal as we go forward over the next three years the major opportunities are in walmartcom and there are also international opportunities where were beginning to introduce that product not only at retail but of course digitally and its a big big part of what goes on between our two companies its been tremendously successful and obviously were looking for good things going forward but this is our oh goodness third major renewal since we made the program a lot bigger and we feel really good about where we are going forward okay dan l kurnos  the benchmark co llc thanks yeah steve im sorry could i just ask joe one quick question housekeeping stephen mark lacy  meredith corp of course joes right here go ahead dan l kurnos  the benchmark co llc joe buyback  million spent between last quarter and this quarter give or take based on what you said with ongoing repurchase authorization given the way that the stock is i guess reacting today is there any thought process to accelerating that or are you trying to keep some powder dry for when this whole spectrum auction joseph h ceryanec  meredith corp oh there is – when i – as i was watching our ticker this morning yes there was clearly some ideas about going in and reconstituting that in a bigger way as we looked at the first quarter we were generally trading kind of in the low s we did take some shares off the table where we had people that we might have had some option exercises or some restricted shares vesting so we always we keep those from diluting the market we were in the market a little bit in q but yeah i would say if we continue to see the pressure and it looks like it may be in our broadcast space some of our peers are pretty red as well we will definitely go in in a bigger way dan l kurnos  the benchmark co llc perfect thanks so much for the color guys appreciate it stephen mark lacy  meredith corp yeah thanks dan operator well go next to the line of marci ryvicker with wells fargo go ahead please miss ryvicker your line is open marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc sorry i was on mute with auto being down  in local isnt that because you have virtually no or i would say little exposure to the olympics stephen mark lacy  meredith corp yeah marci thats a big chunk of it youre absolutely right we had only the nbc affiliate in nashville thats the only nbc affiliate and so certainly theres an impact there and theres also as paul said a few minutes ago especially like in las vegas in kansas city in st louis the political is so heavy that we did have some displacement so there are several factors but yeah youre right we didnt benefit from the olympics very much joseph h ceryanec  meredith corp but i did say marci that nashville was actually up  marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc yes joseph h ceryanec  meredith corp so our one nbc had a great quarter marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc okay and then you said that nonpolitical is soft im assuming its because youre still looking at current pacing and obviously political is huge but if you look out into december do you have any visibility yet for applestoapples what the core is because i dont believe theres anything – theres no real core right now stephen mark lacy  meredith corp yeah i think youre right and paul id like you to comment i think we feel right now marci that these pacings postelection are just really hard to read because of whats going on but paul you might give your sense of when do you really kind of think well get a good sense of how like december is going to firm up paul a karpowicz  meredith corp well really were kind of at that point now where were working very hard to determine if people are going to be back in december or if theyre going to hold off until first quarter and thats why i indicated were going to be incredibly aggressive post election day so on november  were already out there with packaging and incentives and a lot of things to make sure that we can fill up december theres no question that theres a lot of buying to be done for calendar first quarter that hasnt even begun yet that hasnt even crossed peoples desks yet so theres a lot thats going to happen there but we want to make sure that we fill that time period from november  through december and make sure that theres plenty of activity there and at this point for december its still light but were just kind of waiting each day to determine how much additional nonpolitical is going to be available out there stephen mark lacy  meredith corp yeah now factually marci and again not knowing what i can say about the accuracy of the pacings october was actually the weakest november is better and december at this moment is even better yet its still down a little bit but more like lowsingle digits better than we recorded in total in the first quarter but obviously that could change so each month in the quarter were in now the pacings get better as we look forward but im always skittish about december pacings at this point but does that help marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc it does and i have one just last clarification stephen mark lacy  meredith corp of course marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc i dont know if anyone else asked this the range for your political guide for the second quarter i guess what are you assuming for the lowend versus the highend is it what youve already booked on the lowend and what you hope to book for the highend stephen mark lacy  meredith corp yeah let me have joe take that because hes the one in charge of the ouija board on this so hold on joseph h ceryanec  meredith corp yeah no marci i think thats a pretty good observation i think we are very comfortable with the lowend in fact to your point we pretty much have that on the books right now probably the wild card to the higher end or maybe even a little above the higher end is do we see some presidential money coming in or as were seeing the democrats starting to spend maybe shift some dollars into the what ill call the downballot races that would clearly help us get to that higher end or even – if it really comes in we could actually be a little above that paul a karpowicz  meredith corp yeah joe the other wild card is if in fact in georgia they go to a runoff for the senate seat and that would be very very interesting so in the state of georgia a candidate has to get  or more of the popular vote otherwise they have to go to a runoff and from what we understand the polling right now would indicate that theres a very good chance that there would be a runoff there so that would take us certainly to the highend of the range marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc great thank you so much stephen mark lacy  meredith corp thank you marci operator and well go to the line of barry lucas with gabelli  company go ahead please stephen mark lacy  meredith corp hey barry good morning barry l lucas  gabelli  co good morning steve a couple of national media questions if i may your expenses there as you called out were down about ish so im wondering two things one how much of that is the elimination of more so on a same property basis how much were expenses down and then to extend that how much more opportunity is there to continue to reduce the cost base in national media group joseph h ceryanec  meredith corp so barry i think more – im trying to find it here i think the elimination of more was about  of that  so all else wouldve been down  and i guess ill – maybe tom can tell you what hes kind of got in store – tom or jon for the second half but we do have – ill give you a little color on q because i think were also expecting expenses to be down in q as well stephen mark lacy  meredith corp yeah joes looking up some numbers and then joseph h ceryanec  meredith corp yeah we expect second quarter barry to be down probably around that  as well stephen mark lacy  meredith corp okay so tom you might talk about the different buckets what you have strategic sourcing doing and how you think about efficiencies in some of the different parts of the business as we look to the future thomas h harty  meredith corp yeah weve built under doug olsens leadership in the national media group we have a sourcing group that spends a tremendous amount of time and has a target every year to reduce ongoing expenses in different areas and that teams done a fantastic job lowering our cost and were always looking at reallocating our internal resources as we pivot to digital were trying to reallocate content people and through that process were constantly challenging the team to look at the expense side which is people and for the last number of years weve done a fantastic job of really looking at our expense base and making the investments which we think are important to grow the business and on the more side like making a tough decision about a brand that we didnt think was going to be growing into the future of making a decision to move forward without more so its a combination of all but we have a team thats focused on the bottom line and expenses are a big piece of that stephen mark lacy  meredith corp does that help barry barry l lucas  gabelli  co yes it does thank you tom just moving on a little bit im just hoping you can provide a little bit of color on what the pipeline looks like and some of this is serendipitous but youre very successful with martha stewart obtaining the content of the brand allrecipes rachael ray back a few years so without perhaps naming names what does that pipeline look like in terms of opportunity and when you examine the opportunity how much goes into the calculus for lets say the clothing line that you have for shape or the food line for eatingwell does that figure in or in terms of when you think about what youd like to own and stephen mark lacy  meredith corp so let me talk a little bit about the pipeline and im going to broaden your question a bit barry to really kind of talk about the enterprise and then im going to again ask tom to talk about how we think about a shape an eatingwell an allrecipes when we take them on and how we think about expanding the brand but as you know at the moment very very quiet on the television side although we are again cautiously optimistic that some opportunities will come forward as we get into the early part of the year and as joe noted we have again during this quiet period worked very aggressively to move our leverage down to where we have a significant amount of dry powder and our incremental borrowing rate is very very modest then when you move over to the national side we constantly work a series of opportunities where were trying to get the current ownership who oftentimes in my opinion are operating a subscale operation to consider allowing us to take over their brand if you remember in the case of martha the first step of that had nothing to do with content creation she in fact retained content creation and it was sort of a reverse mxm model where we bought the content from her very much like kraft buys content from us to run their properties so in fact im scheduling such a discussion that i hope happens over the next few days but i make the rounds regularly to those sorts of opportunities but currently the more nearterm deal flow is a lot more on the digital side of the business and these are really in kind of three sort of fun and interesting areas it might be a content creation team if you will who have established a digital business and we think it fits right in the sweet spot of one of our core verticals like food or parenthood or whatever or maybe we just think it helps us aggressively expand our millennial reach and we might bring them into the fold to sort of supercharge one of the parts of our businesses it might also be a technology play like jon werther made reference to selectable media a technology play that we think will help us sell more product to the individual consumer and so we look at those and we have really quite an inflow because one of three things happens either they realize theyve got a big audience but they cant monetize it because they couldnt get an advertising sales call if their life depended on it or in fact theyve kind of run out of money or in fact they just want to tap our very large audience to sell products and make more money so we really have more going on on the digital side right now from a deal flow but weve also got some other ones that could be interesting as well and tom why dont you take an example pick one pick eatingwell pick shape and talk about when we take one of those over sort of what do we do to expand that presence thomas h harty  meredith corp yeah i think to steves point where weve been focused on women and our delivery of women and weve been very successful for that so the brands that weve been concentrating on are in that segment but over the last five years and you look at all the acquisitions and you brought up on your first part of your question was on the expense side all of these have delivered weve delivered over  cost savings when we bring it into meredith so when we go back and scorecard it and look at what weve been able to achieve on every single one were able to do that and to the point of having a very diligent sourcing team and great printing contracts and relationships with our printers we can do that and also having the location in des moines iowa which offers us a much cheaper area to operate our business or at least half our business compared to a lot of our competitors in manhattan and then were looking for expanded opportunities to grow those brands so like taking eatingwell from perspective here you have eatingwell we looked at that we saw the research that consumers are looking for healthy alternatives here was a very very small brand up in vermont we acquired it it had a rate base of  we quickly put in our direct marketing expertise and used our  million database to find people that may want this and weve more than tripled the profits and now the rate base is  million up from  so i think thats a great example stephen mark lacy  meredith corp and with the line of dinners that we just launched this fall that will be really fun to see how quickly we can grow that expansion as well barry so does that help answer your question barry l lucas  gabelli  co sure thats very helpful steve thank you and thanks tom stephen mark lacy  meredith corp thank you operator and we will go next to the line of jason bazinet with citi go ahead please stephen mark lacy  meredith corp good morning jason jason boisvert bazinet  citigroup global markets inc broker good morning i just had – maybe this is too specific for you to comment on but based on what you know about the industry given the large scale sort of ma thats going on in the space and the potential fcc license transfers that would have to go on do you think the odds are good or possible that peachtree comes up for sale stephen mark lacy  meredith corp well i think that is certainly a possibility and we have very successfully operated that property for many years it is quite aggressively integrated into our operations in atlanta and we would very much look forward to that opportunity should it bubble up as the broader deal goes forward jason boisvert bazinet  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thank you stephen mark lacy  meredith corp okay jason boisvert bazinet  citigroup global markets inc broker thank you stephen mark lacy  meredith corp so thank you all very much for participating on our call this morning as all joe ceryanec mike lovell
