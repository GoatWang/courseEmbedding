financial measuresunaudited nongaap financial measures the nongaap financial measure of pv as calculated by the company below is intended to provide readers with meaningful information that supplements our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap these disclosures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies further this nongaap measure should only be considered in conjunction with financial statements and disclosures prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures such as net income or loss operating income or loss standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or any other gaap measure of financial position or results of operations pv present value discounted at  pv is a nongaap measure that differs from the gaap measure standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows in that pv is calculated without regard to future income taxes management believes that the presentation of the pv value is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to the companys estimated proved reserves independent of its income tax attributes thereby isolating the intrinsic value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the companys reserves because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid the company believes the use of a pretax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies for these reasons management uses and believes the industry generally uses the pv measure in evaluating and comparing acquisition candidates and assessing the potential return on investment related to investments in oil and natural gas properties pv does not necessarily represent the fair market value of oil and natural gas properties pv is not a measure of financial or operational performance under gaap nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under gaap for a presentation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows see note  – supplementary information on oil and natural gas exploration development and production
