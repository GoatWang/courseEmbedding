 cfocom  us share tweet email print  print  email this article to please enter your email address subject comments it seems like workday has been around forever ceaselessly nipping at the heels of oracle and sap actually it’s been only  years since the company was founded and just under four years since it went public workday cfo robynne sisco at its ipo workday was valued at  billion today its market capitalization has reached  billion and it recently surpassed the  billion annual revenue threshold that makes it a company with some heft but its identity essentially remains what it’s been all along an upstart saas firm seeking to pull market share from two monstersized competitors market caps of  billion and  billion respectively for oracle and sap and revenue of about  billion and  billion profitability is still a ways off with the company spending heavily on rd marketing and talent although it’s nearly achieved breakeven on an operating nongaap basis subtracting stockbased compensation expense that last item is a biggerticket one than is true at most companies as every workday employee receives stock the big key for workday going forward is to make significant market inroads with the suite of cloudbased financial software it’s been building since  to complement its more popular human capital management hcm functionality which is also in the cloud so far workday has gained only a modest degree of traction on the financial side of its business despite competing directly with the two dominant erp vendors that also sell systems providing both financial management and hcm functionality workday doesn’t want to be thought of as an “erp” company one of its oftused marketing slogans is “alternative to erp” why we posed that question among others to workday’s new cfo robynne sisco who was promoted from chief accounting officer in may after four years with the company she reports to former finance chief mark peek who’s now copresident and who was also sisco’s boss at their previous employer vmware an edited version of cfo’s conversation with sisco follows how’s the job going so far it’s going well i think because i’ve been at workday for a few years so i know a lot about the company and the numbers i know the leadership teams so from an internal perspective it’s been very smooth and seamless but i’ve been spending more time trying to get to know the press the wall street analysts and the large investors i didn’t know before from an internal perspective in addition to the accounting team i now also have tax treasury and financial planning and analysis is doing this job like you thought it would be any surprises not yet i’ve been watching mark peek do it for so long but i really want to get my finger more on the pulse of what other cfos are saying are you going to play a sales role i’ve been engaged in the sales cycle for our financials product for the four years i’ve been here potential customers want to talk to someone who’s actually running on the software do they trust you to be objective well i think so the most important thing isn’t inking the contract — it’s making that customer successful and happy so that we know they’re going to be a customer for a long time how we do things is as important to us as what we do we’re not going to lie to a customer to get a contract because that would erode our reputation and customer satisfaction workday is spending more than  of its revenue on rd and also more than  on sales and marketing you’re obviously not profitable what’s the strategy if you look at our sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue with a company that’s a lot more mature than us like salesforce we’re actually significantly lower one reason we have an efficient sales and marketing organization is that we don’t have a lot of churn we’re not constantly losing customers that we have to replace with new sales from an rd perspective we are consciously spending more than our peers in the saas space on continuing to build out the product suite building a financials product is really hard — more complicated than hcm there are a lot more industryspecific requirements while an hcm product can work across the various industries does anybody ever utter the word “profit” at workday oh yes last year on a nongaap basis our operating margin was about breakeven we lost  million on  billion of revenue we’ve said publicly that we’ll be about breakeven again this year but with substantially higher revenue we’re reinvesting all of our incremental revenue back into the business for both product and international expansion purposes but we are at the point in the lifecycle of our company where we need to start showing profitability that will be one of our focus areas at the same time we want to make sure we balance that with the growth that we believe we can continue to achieve and with our company culture which is very important to us rd spending will trail down and it already has that is we’ll spend more dollars each year but it will be a lower percentage of revenue as we start focusing on profitability how about your share price do you look at that some cfos claim that they don’t — that if they do the right things share price will follow oh yeah we look we’ve got a big stockbased component to our compensation plan every single one of our more than  employees gets stock having employee ownership really drives a lot of the great cultural aspects that we have it ties them to customer success and company success but what comes with that is that as stock prices move every employee feels it so we do watch it was passing the billiondollar revenue threshold a meaningful hurdle or is it just a number i think it’s a psychologically meaningful hurdle how many publicly held software companies have made it to  billion i think around  and when you get to  billion it’s something like  cfos are under a lot of pressure these days — demands for more transparent financials mounting regulatory requirements changing accounting standards internal and external demand for better data analytics accelerating ma and greater economic instability how do you cope with all of that you have to have systems that support those things otherwise you end up with a massive finance organization full of spreadsheet junkies who can’t actually stay on top of all the regulations and business changes we bought a company about a year ago called gridcraft that has spreadsheet technology and we’ve embedded it into our financials product you can pull in actuals when doing a forecast or budget that addresses the issue of moving spreadsheets around through emails which is very insecure and creates versioncontrol issues to what degree is that program like excel it’s very like excel it’s got all the functions and formulas that you would expect is it against the law for your accountants to use excel no it’s not against the law someday it might be but we do use it less because so much more can be done in the system back to the pressures is there anything you’re responsible for that might keep you awake at night it’s what i touched on earlier — balancing between profitability growth and culture if you go back a couple of years we were trying to balance growth with the culture now there’s this third component that we know it’s time to worry about so how do we introduce that into the mix without jeopardizing the other two is getting to the right mix a matter of trial and error you move a little bit in one direction see how things work out then maybe move further i hope not but i do think it’s about being willing to make tough decisions because we’re going to have to prioritize if we’re not going to have the same percentage spend on rd what does that mean for the products that our customers want us to build should we have better profitability and not build this product should we build it and let profits be a little lower in making decisions like that how much is based on science and how much on going with your gut there’s some of both you have data and numbers and in the end you have to do what you think is the right thing right because things might be happening or starting to evolve out in the world that aren’t yet reflected in any data you have access to that’s right you have to be flexible because who knows what’s going to happen next with the economy or with currencies the days when you’d set a budget and stick to it for a year are gone it’s about continually refining it and adjusting to external forces tell us about your competitors are there any besides oracle and sap on the large enterprise side that’s generally it in the medium enterprise practice there are other players like netsuite what’s the smallest company you’ll go after we generally don’t do deals with customers under  employees i assume that’s an apt metric for the human capital management side of your business but not as relevant for your financials product it’s the metric for the financials as well that’s how we price it we believe that it’s not about how many finance people are in there using the system it’s about the value that everybody in the company gets out of it whether it be expense reports or procurement or dashboards that allows managers to manage to their budget and see their realtime actuals it’s unlike the old world where the financial systems were accessed only by finance people because they were too complicated and difficult for anyone else to actually get in there and dig around you really had to be an expert on the system now it’s open to everybody that’s one of our value propositions how many customers do you have for your financials product about  most of them run the hcm product as well they generally buy that first and then we go back and sell them the financials and in a lot of cases we sell both at once we do have a couple of customers that bought financials and may someday buy hcm i’m sure those systems are integrated but “integration” could mean a lot of different things what does integration mean to you we wouldn’t actually say they’re integrated because it’s all one product customers buy the right to use certain pieces of it if you buy all of it you can look at particular employees and see what security access they have how much money they make their home address what expense reports they’ve filed what purchase requisitions they’ve done who works for them its hcm and financial data all connected sounds something like an erp so why does workday refer to its product as the “alternative to erp” “erp” tends to be associated with the older legacy technologies but aren’t people who buy those capabilities used to thinking of them as erp stuff if you’re not using that term does it impede you from resonating with customers no i don’t think so people are starting to feel more comfortable with the cloud these days workday is referring to itself as a provider of “financial management and human capital management” software why do you give top billing to the financial side when only a fraction of your customers are using the financial suite because we believe the financials are our biggest opportunity and are the more complex part of the product speaking of human capital management what’s your view of the shortage of top finance and accounting talent that everybody is talking about it’s interesting because the profile of people we hire is very different from whom i would have hired at previous companies given that we’re on our own software what difference does that make it’s less about inputting data and spreadsheet jockeying because you can get what you need out of the system without having to download everything it’s more about continuous change in business support and analytics you still have to do the transactions but when they’re automated in a better way you can spend less time on them the user experience is just like a consumer website you can go to amazon and figure out how to buy stuff workday is similar in that it’s intuitive you can go in there and figure out how to get the data you need so the type of people we hire are more analytical and they’re

robynne sisco if a potential hire is going to manage people make sure you personally do the interview by larry dignan for between the lines  july     gmt  pdt  topic cloud  robynne sisco cfo of workday has a background at large companies such as vmware verisign and ge that know how to scale now sisco is involved with scaling profits culture revenue and being the front woman as workday develops its financial software which is aimed at other cfosworkday cfo robynne siscowe caught up with sisco to talk shop as well as how finance views the returns on research and development sales people and workdays somewhat quirky reporting structure heres a look at the highlightsbalance sisco said one of her biggest challengesalong with workdays management team overallis balancing growth profits and investment how do you continue to grow keep your culture and strengths in customer satisfaction said sisco now we need to think about profitability and its time to do that in a methodical way if we wanted to be profitable we could simply do it by not hiring but we dont believe thats in our longterm interest culture of those balancing act items sisco said scaling up and keeping workdays culture is what worries her the most the significant part of our employees have been here less than a year more are two years said sisco how do you perpetuate culture every company faces that challenge as they cross the  person mark sisco said she will also interview anyone who is going to be a people manager its important to not hire the wrong person we want people who love a job that changes said sisco special feature how ux is transforming enterprise software todays smartest businesses get serious about how to design user interfaces that drive efficiency increase user adoption and impact customer satisfaction read more return on research and development our rd time is spent on product innovation and moving forward she said were focused on building out our suite and targeting industries were not dialing it back but were determining how much revenue we allow to fall to the bottom line we have robust processes for prioritizing the product roadmap and have an advisory board sisco added that rd will change over time as a percentage of revenue as workdays suite is built out the view of rd is different at a company that specializes in multitenant saas infrastructure since there is continuous features being rolled out reporting structure sisco reports to copresident mark peek who used to be cfo peek has the business operations functions at workday with phil wilmington the other copresident handling sales and customer operations ceo aneel bhusri is focused on product development the structure is a quirky one relative to other companies but sisco said decisions about forecasts and planning have the four of them at the table its somewhat of an interesting structure but it works well she said contracts with customers the length of contracts with customers remains about three years but there are a lot of variables we are seeing longer contracts from large customers but they vary said sisco who noted that how much cash comes from the customer upfront is a variable were looking at the long term said sisco referring to contract negotiations she added that there are specific requests for instance one customer wanted to pay  years upfront because they had the cash flow at the time the dream contract is a threeyear deal with a balanced mix of cash and subscription one thing that doesnt change with cloud companies is the traditional enterprise software seasonality we still have seasonality and the end of quarter push i guess thats the way enterprise buying has always been done said sisco special feature enterprise apps the next generation enterprise applications power the heart of business productivity but they are traditionally difficult to implement upgrade and innovate we look at how the next generation of enterprise apps could change the game read more acquisitions we operate on a single technology platform and dont buy companies and bolt them on she said its the best answer for our customers sisco said workday has traditionally focused on acquisitions that are technology tuckin deals where its a straight build vs buy decision roi on a sales team workday is a bit different than other enterprise software vendors in that it is nearly  percent direct sales to customers sisco said if customer satisfaction is important we dont want people in between as for the sales return on investment workday looks at the cost to acquire a customer and the marketing and commissions associated with it if revenue is x cost youre in great shape were now x she said one big reason workday is getting roi on adding sales people is that it doesnt have churn losing customers and then replacing them complicates matters she added it spend peek is in charge of it but sisco noted that most internal systems revolve around workdays product we typically only want to use saas and products that are philosophically aligned she said we also like doing business with our customers running workday is one of the most important things we do indeed workday recently hired diana mckenzie as cio to grow the companys internal it services team mckenzie knows a bit about scaling up since she spent  years at amgen and was an it leader at eli lilly another large company the cfo role siscos role revolves around internal planning and forecasting as well as being front facing with other cfos siscos talks with other cfos hit some product and also general issues in the field after all workday financials was influenced by the internal financial group were the first to try something and show whats possible she said  log in to comment my

chief financial officer workday courtesy of workdaypoint cloudwhat workday’s new cfo says about the quest for profitabilityheather clancyaug  a common refrain during business software company workdays past two quarterly financial updates has been the growth for its cloud financial management software that products performance will be in the spotlight again after the market close on wednesday when workday issues its secondquarter financial resultsbased on an average of wall street estimates workday wday is expected to post a  revenue increase for the quarter to around  million theyre expected a loss of two cents per share compared with a profit of two cents for the same quarter one year agoworkday is expanding beyond its stronghold in cloud human resources systems into management software delivered via cloud services for finance teams last year it restructured its sales team to accelerate adoption winning over big accounts such as insurance giant aon and commercial real estate powerhouse cushman  wakefield but these are long sales cycles and at least one analyst needhams scott berg isnt expecting much progress in this latest quarter based on a research note he published earlier this weekhe wrotewe like workdays longterm strategy and believe its significant push into financials is the right strategic move but our checks continue to suggest the high end of the human resource management software market remains slow and competitive along with financials sales remaining difficult as customers dont seem ready for a cloud solution and functionality not quite complete yetone of the more innovative features of the workday financial management solution a model that helps with business planning is due before the end of  its acquisition of startup platfora in july points to ongoing investments in the softwares predictive analytics featuresalthough workdays stock took a hit early this week based on the needham commentary its shares have already recovered most of that ground the company was trading at  around midday wednesdayget data sheet fortune’s daily technology newsletterrelatedpointcloudmicrosoft and airbus just got drone feverpointcloudmicrosoft and airbus just got drone feveranother theme likely to be sounded during workdays conference call its quest to improve profitability a big strategic priority for its new cfo robynne sisco who has been in her position for about four months sisco was previously workdays chief accounting officer prior to that she held positions at companies including vmware vmw verisign vrsn and oracle orclhow hard will that be workday was break even for its last fiscal year and is hoping for the same during its current one fortune caught up with sisco in midjuly to discuss her evolving agenda here are excerpts from that interview edited for clarity and lengthfortune what is your primary focussisco really three key areas growth which has been a focus area for us obviously for quite some time and how do we continue to grow at a fast clip because that’s what everybody wants of us culture which is another important element to us how do we maintain the culture not just over time but as we expand internationally as we grow and get bigger over  employees how do you make sure the culture can continue to live on as you grow and expand and change as a company and we’ve added a third profitability has been a core value of ours since day one but we have not had it as a focus area because we’ve been really focused on the growth story now that we’re over  billion in revenue it’s really time for us to start focusing on profitability our challenge will be how we balance the threewhat is it about the profitability metric that seems so difficult for cloud software companiesi don’t know that it’s difficult it’s about prioritization we were breakeven last year we have publicly said we expect to be about breakeven this year it’s all about us wanting to invest in our product we have a huge market opportunity we have huge technological advantages over our competitors a lot of our value proposition is our continuous innovation of our product that we deliver to our customers at no extra cost and wanting to build planning build learning build student as well as continue to enhance the products we already have how do we balance that investment with profitabilityin the early days it’s about building the product and really taking what you’ve earned and—in the early days more than what you’ve earned—and reinvesting it back into the product if you look at our rd compared to a more mature cloud company like a salesforce crm you’ll see that it’s significantly higher because we’re trying to invest in the product and we’ve got a lot we want to do on that front but you do reach a point where we’re at now where you realize it’s time for us to turn the corner we can’t keep reinvesting every incremental dollar we make back into the product we have to find a balance that allows us to move toward profitabilitywhat does that mean about your rd investmentwe will be extremely thoughtful and deliberate about what that looks like we will still spend more on rd every year going forward into the future it just means that there will be some incremental revenue we let fall to the bottom line the other thing that we’re doing we need to really take advantage of the scale that we have as a company when it comes to the suppliers that we use whether it be travel suppliers or other types of vendors that we use we are now a large enough company that we’ve got buying powerone promise of cloud financial management systems is the notion that companies can move away from an annual budget cycle and do this more on an ongoing basis is this realisticwe are continually forecasting when workday planning comes out later this year when we go on that then we will be on a more continuous budgeting mode i think there will always be an annual cycle around board approvals and those sorts of things we still need to look it in oneyear terms for things like guidance but we will start to plan further out and hope to get to a point in the near future where we are doing continuous—like  months or  months—longer continuous cyclesit is a very acquisitive time in the software industry right now what is workday’s acquisition strategyyou’ve seen us buy smaller technology tuckins and that’s what you’re like to continue to see we feel like part of the big story or value proposition is having a single technology a single platform we don’t have these boltons like our competitors do we don’t expect to buy products that have significant revenue streams and bolt them on because that goes against our core philosophy what we do do is go out and try to identify cool technologies that we can embed in our product that are invisible to the customerare you seeing increased pressure from big legacy business software companieswe actually haven’t seen the tactics change much in the last several years they are using pricing to lure customers onto their cloud products depending on how you define cloud that pressure is being offset by the fact that they can’t show live happy customers at

updated oct    share this month finance monthly takes a close look at the work and accomplishments of robynne sisco – the chief financial officer of the californian company workday – a leading provider of enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources the company was founded in  with a vision to deliver a modern cloudfirst approach to financial and human capital management applications today workday has more than  customers ranging from mediumsized businesses to fortune  enterprises in her role robynne oversees all aspects of the company’s finance organisation including accounting tax treasury and financial planning and analysis   you have been cfo of workday since april what have beenare your priorities in your new role the top three priorities for me as cfo are growth profitability and culture and helping to ensure we maintain the right balance across all three workday continues to be in growth mode whether it be expanding our product portfolio or growing our market footprint but as workday continues to grow there is greater pressure to also become profitable an important factor in helping our company succeed in the long term at the same time our great culture always remains top of mind as it impacts all areas of our business from employee recruitment and retention to innovation and customer satisfaction so in my role i am focused on continuously evaluating all three and making sure we’re making progress in each area without any compromises   what education or prior experience helped you succeed at your current role i knew early on that i wanted to go into finance math and numbers felt natural to me so i focused on making that my career from the start i’ve worked at a variety of companies starting my career in public accounting and moving on to companies like ge and visa where i learned a lot about how finance works in large global organisations i eventually transitioned into the tech industry where i was exposed to accounting for different business models – such as software as a service – as we well as working for companies that were the technology providers for key back office functions such as finance and hr it was through these experiences that i not only developed my skills and took on new responsibilities but learned the importance of having the right technology systems in place to enable me and my team to be successful in our roles the years of knowledge combined with firsthand experience in helping build and use modern finance systems – such as workday financial management – have played an important role in helping me reach this point in my career   what was the most challenging period of your career and how did you overcome it early in my career i worked at a few companies that weren’t the best cultural fit which pushed me to learn how to be effective in my role while also being careful to remain focused on who i am as a person while these experiences were challenging they were ultimately great learning experiences that taught me how important it is to be at a company where you share the same values as the rest of the organisation so you can be both successful and true to yourself   what motivates you most about operating within the computer software industry for me it’s about the long term opportunity ahead of us i’m passionate about what i do and about workday because i think we’re delivering something that is not only innovative but business critical and doing it in a way that puts customers and employees first the business environment in which we operate has undergone significant change in the last few decades – whether it’s new regulations increased competition for talent or heightened pressure to grow organisations this new dynamic is putting pressure on business leaders to deliver insights and make decisions more quickly than ever before what we’re finding however is that their ability to do this is hindered by legacy technology systems that can no longer support the way they want to work at workday we’re focused on finding a better way and enabling today’s organisations to adapt more quickly to business changes whether it’s responding in real time to employee needs or delivering richer insights around financial performance   how does workday’s business model influence how significant market and regional changes impact its business  with workday’s software as a service saas business model revenue is recognised rateably over the contract terms this means that any market changes whether regional or otherwise will take a while to impact revenue the benefit of this is it allows us the time to make decisions about if or how we want and need to respond to market changes this is different from the perpetual license model where an organisation is dependent on new sales each quarter to meet short term revenue targets and will likely feel the impact immediately   in terms of market competition where does the company stand globally and what are workday’s goals moving forward our business is growing at a fast clip and we’re seeing an increasing demand for our products globally we currently have operations in the us canada europe and the asia pacific region with more than  employees and  customers including such companies as ing unum hitachi fast retailing rollsroyce and unilever in most cases we’re displacing legacy systems with customers wanting more modern cloudbased finance and hr systems to move their businesses forward our focus is and will continue to be on partnering with our customer community to innovate and deliver a robust product offering that not only supports them today but for years to come as their needs evolve and their businesses scale in addition to our product innovation the core focus areas that i mentioned earlier of growth profitability and culture are not only priorities for me but for the entire organisation as we move forward   you might also like more from author editors picks here’s why future
