rotc center remembrance park honors more than a thousand ohio state alumni who as military personnel lost their lives in service to the united states ncaa violations and resignationedit on march   ohio state suspended tressel for the first two games of the  season and fined him  for failing to notify the school of ncaa violations involving ohio state football players the players had a financial arrangement with edward rife owner of a local tattoo parlor who was at the time under investigation by the fbi for drug trafficking the arrangement which resulted in five ohio state football players being suspended involved trading championship rings jerseys and other footballrelated awards for tattoos that arrangement was a violation of ncaa rules and would have rendered the players including star quarterback terrelle pryor ineligible to play for portions of the  season tressel was first notified of the arrangement in april  when he received several emails from chris cicero a local attorney and former ohio state walkon football player tressel never forwarded the emails nor the information contained in them about potential violations to his schools compliance office or the ncaa although tressel had held the position of athletic director at youngstown state tressels excuse was that he did not know whom to contact when he learned of the alleged violations tressel also later claimed not to have acted because of concerns about the confidentiality of the information yet he immediately forwarded the first email to terrelle pryors mentor on december   ohio state was notified by the department of justice that it had in its possession many items of ohio state sports memorabilia seized from edward rifes tattoo parlor in the ensuing investigation tressel was questioned by ohio state on december  concerning his knowledge of the activities disclosed by the justice department the sale of rings jerseys and football memorabilia to rife tressel denied any specific knowledge of the violations and claimed that he could not remember who had given him the vague information a week later tressel exchanged text messages with cicero the attorney who had originally notified him of the activities back in april tressel verified that the justice department matter involved the same players and issues as the april emails tressel remained silent his longtime knowledge of the violations and his subsequent intentional fielding of ineligible players throughout the season was only revealed when ohio state inadvertently discovered the april  cicero emails in an unrelated search in january  on march   it was announced that tressel requested ohio state athletic director gene smith that he extend his own suspension to the same number of games as his players smith accepted the request and as a result tressel would have missed the first five games of the  season “ no are you kiddingim just hoping the coach doesnt dismiss me ” — ohio state president gordon gee when asked whether he would fire tressel ohio state president gordon gee assured the public that tressel would not lose his job over the matter on april   the ncaa accused tressel of withholding information and lying to keep buckeyes players on the field in a notice of allegations sent to ohio state the ncaa charged that tressels actions were considered potential major violations which had permitted football studentathletes to participate in intercollegiate athletics while ineligible the report also said he failed to comport himself  with honesty and integrity and that he lied when he filled out a compliance form in september stating that he had no knowledge of ncaa violations by any of his players tressel later stated that he lied about the violations because he didnt want to jeopardize the fbis investigation against rife and also feared for his players safety despite his stated safety concerns tressel only briefly spoke with two players never inquired of the two if other players were involved and also in danger nor in his discussions with players ever mentioned mr rife the tattoo parlor or the selling of ohio state merchandise the ncaas report explicitly refuted the credibility of this excuse tressel resigned as ohio states head football coach on may   three days earlier sports illustrated reported that it had found evidence that the memorabiliafortattoos scandal dated back to at least the  national championship season and as many as  players were involved early on the morning of memorial day gee and smith called tressel back from his vacation in florida and asked for his resignation the columbus dispatch reported that gee had appointed a special committee to examine the scandals impact on the school it also reported that ohio state had been looking to cut ties with tressel for several weeks tressel said in a statement released by the university after meeting with university officials we agreed that it is in the best interest of ohio state that i resign as head football coach the appreciation that ellen and i have for the buckeye nation is immeasurable luke fickell previously codefensive coordinator and assistant head coach served as head coach for the  football season tressel left ohio state as the thirdwinningest coach in school history behind woody hayes and john cooper however on july   ohio state vacated all of its wins from the  season and placed the football program on two years probation on december   the ncaa placed ohio state on an additional one years probation and banned it from postseason play in  for numerous major violations under tressels watch it also imposed a fiveyear showcause penalty on tressel which means any ncaa member that wants to hire him would have to show cause for why it shouldnt be sanctioned for hiring him and could face severe penalties if he commits any further violations during that time the order stood until december   given past precedent this likely had the effect of blackballing tressel from the coaching ranks until the  season had tressel coached during this period he would have been suspended for the first five games of the regular season plus any conference championship game or bowl game indianapolis coltsedit on september   tressel was hired by the indianapolis colts as a gamedayreplay consultant tressel was suspended by the colts until the th game of the season due to his involvement in the ncaa violations during his tenure as head coach at ohio state administrative careeredit university of akronedit on february   tressel accepted a nonathleticdepartment position where he started his coaching career the university of akron tressels new title was vice president for student success vice president for strategic engagement return to youngstown state universityedit in january  various media reports stated that tressel would possibly return to youngstown state to replace retiring university president cynthia anderson as the next president of the university while tressel is still revered in the area a new athletic training complex bearing his name the watson and tressel training site opened on campus in  tressels highest level of education is a masters degree a doctorate is virtually a prerequisite for any university president position in the united states combined with the showcause penalty that is in effect for tressel until  on paper it would have been a tough sell for ysu to bring back tressel supporters for bringing back tressel also cited this but mentioned that as university president his primary job would be for fundraising in which tressel had previously excelled over the years as head coach at both ysu and ohio state on may   randy dunn was chosen as successor to anderson but only stayed on the job for seven months ultimately leaving for southern illinois university after dunns sudden departure tressels name again came up for the position with tressel officially applying for the position on april   while simultaneously still being one of  candidates for the university of akron presidents job nearly a month later on may   the ysu board of trustees offered tressel the university president position after a unanimous vote after which tressel accepted the position as ysus new president and announced he was officially retired from coaching head coaching recordedit year team overall conference standing

united states ncaa violations and resignationedit on march   ohio state suspended tressel for the first two games of the  season and fined him  for failing to notify the school of ncaa violations involving ohio state football players the players had a financial arrangement with edward rife owner of a local tattoo parlor who was at the time under investigation by the fbi for drug trafficking the arrangement which resulted in five ohio state football players being suspended involved trading championship rings jerseys and other footballrelated awards for tattoos that arrangement was a violation of ncaa rules and would have rendered the players including star quarterback terrelle pryor ineligible to play for portions of the  season tressel was first notified of the arrangement in april  when he received several emails from chris cicero a local attorney and former ohio state walkon football player tressel never forwarded the emails nor the information contained in them about potential violations to his schools compliance office or the ncaa although tressel had held the position of athletic director at youngstown state tressels excuse was that he did not know whom to contact when he learned of the alleged violations tressel also later claimed not to have acted because of concerns about the confidentiality of the information yet he immediately forwarded the first email to terrelle pryors mentor on december   ohio state was notified by the department of justice that it had in its possession many items of ohio state sports memorabilia seized from edward rifes tattoo parlor in the ensuing investigation tressel was questioned by ohio state on december  concerning his knowledge of the activities disclosed by the justice department the sale of rings jerseys and football memorabilia to rife tressel denied any specific knowledge of the violations and claimed that he could not remember who had given him the vague information a week later tressel exchanged text messages with cicero the attorney who had originally notified him of the activities back in april tressel verified that the justice department matter involved the same players and issues as the april emails tressel remained silent his longtime knowledge of the violations and his subsequent intentional fielding of ineligible players throughout the season was only revealed when ohio state inadvertently discovered the april  cicero emails in an unrelated search in january  on march   it was announced that tressel requested ohio state athletic director gene smith that he extend his own suspension to the same number of games as his players smith accepted the request and as a result tressel would have missed the first five games of the  season “ no are you kiddingim just hoping the coach doesnt dismiss me ” — ohio state president gordon gee when asked whether he would fire tressel ohio state president gordon gee assured the public that tressel would not lose his job over the matter on april   the ncaa accused tressel of withholding information and lying to keep buckeyes players on the field in a notice of allegations sent to ohio state the ncaa charged that tressels actions were considered potential major violations which had permitted football studentathletes to participate in intercollegiate athletics while ineligible the report also said he failed to comport himself  with honesty and integrity and that he lied when he filled out a compliance form in september stating that he had no knowledge of ncaa violations by any of his players tressel later stated that he lied about the violations because he didnt want to jeopardize the fbis investigation against rife and also feared for his players safety despite his stated safety concerns tressel only briefly spoke with two players never inquired of the two if other players were involved and also in danger nor in his discussions with players ever mentioned mr rife the tattoo parlor or the selling of ohio state merchandise the ncaas report explicitly refuted the credibility of this excuse tressel resigned as ohio states head football coach on may   three days earlier sports illustrated reported that it had found evidence that the memorabiliafortattoos scandal dated back to at least the  national championship season and as many as  players were involved early on the morning of memorial day gee and smith called tressel back from his vacation in florida and asked for his resignation the columbus dispatch reported that gee had appointed a special committee to examine the scandals impact on the school it also reported that ohio state had been looking to cut ties with tressel for several weeks tressel said in a statement released by the university after meeting with university officials we agreed that it is in the best interest of ohio state that i resign as head football coach the appreciation that ellen and i have for the buckeye nation is immeasurable luke fickell previously codefensive coordinator and assistant head coach served as head coach for the  football season tressel left ohio state as the thirdwinningest coach in school history behind woody hayes and john cooper however on july   ohio state vacated all of its wins from the  season and placed the football program on two years probation on december   the ncaa placed ohio state on an additional one years probation and banned it from postseason play in  for numerous major violations under tressels watch it also imposed a fiveyear showcause penalty on tressel which means any ncaa member that wants to hire him would have to show cause for why it shouldnt be sanctioned for hiring him and could face severe penalties if he commits any further violations during that time the order stood until december   given past precedent this likely had the effect of blackballing tressel from the coaching ranks until the  season had tressel coached during this period he would have been suspended for the first five games of the regular season plus any conference championship game or bowl game indianapolis coltsedit on september   tressel was hired by the indianapolis colts as a gamedayreplay consultant tressel was suspended by the colts until the th game of the season due to his involvement in the ncaa violations during his tenure as head coach at ohio state administrative careeredit university of akronedit on february   tressel accepted a nonathleticdepartment position where he started his coaching career the university of akron tressels new title was vice president for student success vice president for strategic engagement return to youngstown state universityedit in january  various media reports stated that tressel would possibly return to youngstown state to replace retiring university president cynthia anderson as the next president of the university while tressel is still revered in the area a new athletic training complex bearing his name the watson and tressel training site opened on campus in  tressels highest level of education is a masters degree a doctorate is virtually a prerequisite for any university president position in the united states combined with the showcause penalty that is in effect for tressel until  on paper it would have been a tough sell for ysu to bring back tressel supporters for bringing back tressel also cited this but mentioned that as university president his primary job would be for fundraising in which tressel had previously excelled over the years as head coach at both ysu and ohio state on may   randy dunn was chosen as successor to anderson but only stayed on the job for seven months ultimately leaving for southern illinois university after dunns sudden departure tressels name again came up for the position with tressel officially applying for the position on april   while simultaneously still being one of  candidates for the university of akron presidents job nearly a month later on may   the ysu board of trustees offered tressel the university president position after a unanimous vote after which tressel accepted the position as ysus new president and announced he was officially retired

united states ncaa violations and resignationedit on march   ohio state suspended tressel for the first two games of the  season and fined him  for failing to notify the school of ncaa violations involving ohio state football players the players had a financial arrangement with edward rife owner of a local tattoo parlor who was at the time under investigation by the fbi for drug trafficking the arrangement which resulted in five ohio state football players being suspended involved trading championship rings jerseys and other footballrelated awards for tattoos that arrangement was a violation of ncaa rules and would have rendered the players including star quarterback terrelle pryor ineligible to play for portions of the  season tressel was first notified of the arrangement in april  when he received several emails from chris cicero a local attorney and former ohio state walkon football player tressel never forwarded the emails nor the information contained in them about potential violations to his schools compliance office or the ncaa although tressel had held the position of athletic director at youngstown state tressels excuse was that he did not know whom to contact when he learned of the alleged violations tressel also later claimed not to have acted because of concerns about the confidentiality of the information yet he immediately forwarded the first email to terrelle pryors mentor on december   ohio state was notified by the department of justice that it had in its possession many items of ohio state sports memorabilia seized from edward rifes tattoo parlor in the ensuing investigation tressel was questioned by ohio state on december  concerning his knowledge of the activities disclosed by the justice department the sale of rings jerseys and football memorabilia to rife tressel denied any specific knowledge of the violations and claimed that he could not remember who had given him the vague information a week later tressel exchanged text messages with cicero the attorney who had originally notified him of the activities back in april tressel verified that the justice department matter involved the same players and issues as the april emails tressel remained silent his longtime knowledge of the violations and his subsequent intentional fielding of ineligible players throughout the season was only revealed when ohio state inadvertently discovered the april  cicero emails in an unrelated search in january  on march   it was announced that tressel requested ohio state athletic director gene smith that he extend his own suspension to the same number of games as his players smith accepted the request and as a result tressel would have missed the first five games of the  season “ no are you kiddingim just hoping the coach doesnt dismiss me ” — ohio state president gordon gee when asked whether he would fire tressel ohio state president gordon gee assured the public that tressel would not lose his job over the matter on april   the ncaa accused tressel of withholding information and lying to keep buckeyes players on the field in a notice of allegations sent to ohio state the ncaa charged that tressels actions were considered potential major violations which had permitted football studentathletes to participate in intercollegiate athletics while ineligible the report also said he failed to comport himself  with honesty and integrity and that he lied when he filled out a compliance form in september stating that he had no knowledge of ncaa violations by any of his players tressel later stated that he lied about the violations because he didnt want to jeopardize the fbis investigation against rife and also feared for his players safety despite his stated safety concerns tressel only briefly spoke with two players never inquired of the two if other players were involved and also in danger nor in his discussions with players ever mentioned mr rife the tattoo parlor or the selling of ohio state merchandise the ncaas report explicitly refuted the credibility of this excuse tressel resigned as ohio states head football coach on may   three days earlier sports illustrated reported that it had found evidence that the memorabiliafortattoos scandal dated back to at least the  national championship season and as many as  players were involved early on the morning of memorial day gee and smith called tressel back from his vacation in florida and asked for his resignation the columbus dispatch reported that gee had appointed a special committee to examine the scandals impact on the school it also reported that ohio state had been looking to cut ties with tressel for several weeks tressel said in a statement released by the university after meeting with university officials we agreed that it is in the best interest of ohio state that i resign as head football coach the appreciation that ellen and i have for the buckeye nation is immeasurable luke fickell previously codefensive coordinator and assistant head coach served as head coach for the  football season tressel left ohio state as the thirdwinningest coach in school history behind woody hayes and john cooper however on july   ohio state vacated all of its wins from the  season and placed the football program on two years probation on december   the ncaa placed ohio state on an additional one years probation and banned it from postseason play in  for numerous major violations under tressels watch it also imposed a fiveyear showcause penalty on tressel which means any ncaa member that wants to hire him would have to show cause for why it shouldnt be sanctioned for hiring him and could face severe penalties if he commits any further violations during that time the order stood until december   given past precedent this likely had the effect of blackballing tressel from the coaching ranks until the  season had tressel coached during this period he would have been suspended for the first five games of the regular season plus any conference championship game or bowl game indianapolis coltsedit on september   tressel was hired by the indianapolis colts as a gamedayreplay consultant tressel was suspended by the colts until the th game of the season due to his involvement in the ncaa violations during his tenure as head coach at ohio state administrative careeredit university of akronedit on february   tressel accepted a nonathleticdepartment position where he started his coaching career the university of akron tressels new title was vice president for student success vice president for strategic engagement return to youngstown state universityedit in january  various media reports stated that tressel would possibly return to youngstown state to replace retiring university president cynthia anderson as the next president of the university while tressel is still revered in the area a new athletic training complex bearing his name the watson and tressel training site opened on campus in  tressels highest level of education is a masters degree a doctorate is virtually a prerequisite for any university president position in the united states combined with the showcause penalty that is in effect for tressel until  on paper it would have been a tough sell for ysu to bring back tressel supporters for bringing back tressel also cited this but mentioned that as university president his primary job would be for fundraising in which tressel had previously excelled over the years as head coach at both ysu and ohio state on may   randy dunn was chosen as successor to anderson but only stayed on the job for seven months ultimately leaving for southern illinois university after dunns sudden departure tressels name again came up for the position with tressel officially applying for the position on april   while simultaneously still being one of  candidates for the university of akron presidents job nearly a month later on may   the ysu board of trustees offered tressel the university president position after a unanimous vote after which tressel accepted the position as ysus new president and announced he was officially retired

united states ncaa violations and resignationedit on march   ohio state suspended tressel for the first two games of the  season and fined him  for failing to notify the school of ncaa violations involving ohio state football players the players had a financial arrangement with edward rife owner of a local tattoo parlor who was at the time under investigation by the fbi for drug trafficking the arrangement which resulted in five ohio state football players being suspended involved trading championship rings jerseys and other footballrelated awards for tattoos that arrangement was a violation of ncaa rules and would have rendered the players including star quarterback terrelle pryor ineligible to play for portions of the  season tressel was first notified of the arrangement in april  when he received several emails from chris cicero a local attorney and former ohio state walkon football player tressel never forwarded the emails nor the information contained in them about potential violations to his schools compliance office or the ncaa although tressel had held the position of athletic director at youngstown state tressels excuse was that he did not know whom to contact when he learned of the alleged violations tressel also later claimed not to have acted because of concerns about the confidentiality of the information yet he immediately forwarded the first email to terrelle pryors mentor on december   ohio state was notified by the department of justice that it had in its possession many items of ohio state sports memorabilia seized from edward rifes tattoo parlor in the ensuing investigation tressel was questioned by ohio state on december  concerning his knowledge of the activities disclosed by the justice department the sale of rings jerseys and football memorabilia to rife tressel denied any specific knowledge of the violations and claimed that he could not remember who had given him the vague information a week later tressel exchanged text messages with cicero the attorney who had originally notified him of the activities back in april tressel verified that the justice department matter involved the same players and issues as the april emails tressel remained silent his longtime knowledge of the violations and his subsequent intentional fielding of ineligible players throughout the season was only revealed when ohio state inadvertently discovered the april  cicero emails in an unrelated search in january  on march   it was announced that tressel requested ohio state athletic director gene smith that he extend his own suspension to the same number of games as his players smith accepted the request and as a result tressel would have missed the first five games of the  season “ no are you kiddingim just hoping the coach doesnt dismiss me ” — ohio state president gordon gee when asked whether he would fire tressel ohio state president gordon gee assured the public that tressel would not lose his job over the matter on april   the ncaa accused tressel of withholding information and lying to keep buckeyes players on the field in a notice of allegations sent to ohio state the ncaa charged that tressels actions were considered potential major violations which had permitted football studentathletes to participate in intercollegiate athletics while ineligible the report also said he failed to comport himself  with honesty and integrity and that he lied when he filled out a compliance form in september stating that he had no knowledge of ncaa violations by any of his players tressel later stated that he lied about the violations because he didnt want to jeopardize the fbis investigation against rife and also feared for his players safety despite his stated safety concerns tressel only briefly spoke with two players never inquired of the two if other players were involved and also in danger nor in his discussions with players ever mentioned mr rife the tattoo parlor or the selling of ohio state merchandise the ncaas report explicitly refuted the credibility of this excuse tressel resigned as ohio states head football coach on may   three days earlier sports illustrated reported that it had found evidence that the memorabiliafortattoos scandal dated back to at least the  national championship season and as many as  players were involved early on the morning of memorial day gee and smith called tressel back from his vacation in florida and asked for his resignation the columbus dispatch reported that gee had appointed a special committee to examine the scandals impact on the school it also reported that ohio state had been looking to cut ties with tressel for several weeks tressel said in a statement released by the university after meeting with university officials we agreed that it is in the best interest of ohio state that i resign as head football coach the appreciation that ellen and i have for the buckeye nation is immeasurable luke fickell previously codefensive coordinator and assistant head coach served as head coach for the  football season tressel left ohio state as the thirdwinningest coach in school history behind woody hayes and john cooper however on july   ohio state vacated all of its wins from the  season and placed the football program on two years probation on december   the ncaa placed ohio state on an additional one years probation and banned it from postseason play in  for numerous major violations under tressels watch it also imposed a fiveyear showcause penalty on tressel which means any ncaa member that wants to hire him would have to show cause for why it shouldnt be sanctioned for hiring him and could face severe penalties if he commits any further violations during that time the order stood until december   given past precedent this likely had the effect of blackballing tressel from the coaching ranks until the  season had tressel coached during this period he would have been suspended for the first five games of the regular season plus any conference championship game or bowl game indianapolis coltsedit on september   tressel was hired by the indianapolis colts as a gamedayreplay consultant tressel was suspended by the colts until the th game of the season due to his involvement in the ncaa violations during his tenure as head coach at ohio state administrative careeredit university of akronedit on february   tressel accepted a nonathleticdepartment position where he started his coaching career the university of akron tressels new title was vice president for student success vice president for strategic engagement return to youngstown state universityedit in january  various media reports stated that tressel would possibly return to youngstown state to replace retiring university president cynthia anderson as the next president of the university while tressel is still revered in the area a new athletic training complex bearing his name the watson and tressel training site opened on campus in  tressels highest level of education is a masters degree a doctorate is virtually a prerequisite for any university president position in the united states combined with the showcause penalty that is in effect for tressel until  on paper it would have been a tough sell for ysu to bring back tressel supporters for bringing back tressel also cited this but mentioned that as university president his primary job would be for fundraising in which tressel had previously excelled over the years as head coach at both ysu and ohio state on may   randy dunn was chosen as successor to anderson but only stayed on the job for seven months ultimately leaving for southern illinois university after dunns sudden departure tressels name again came up for the position with tressel officially applying for the position on april   while simultaneously still being one of  candidates for the university of akron presidents job nearly a month later on may   the ysu board of trustees offered tressel the university president position after a unanimous vote after which tressel accepted the position as ysus new president and announced he was officially retired

united states ncaa violations and resignationedit on march   ohio state suspended tressel for the first two games of the  season and fined him  for failing to notify the school of ncaa violations involving ohio state football players the players had a financial arrangement with edward rife owner of a local tattoo parlor who was at the time under investigation by the fbi for drug trafficking the arrangement which resulted in five ohio state football players being suspended involved trading championship rings jerseys and other footballrelated awards for tattoos that arrangement was a violation of ncaa rules and would have rendered the players including star quarterback terrelle pryor ineligible to play for portions of the  season tressel was first notified of the arrangement in april  when he received several emails from chris cicero a local attorney and former ohio state walkon football player tressel never forwarded the emails nor the information contained in them about potential violations to his schools compliance office or the ncaa although tressel had held the position of athletic director at youngstown state tressels excuse was that he did not know whom to contact when he learned of the alleged violations tressel also later claimed not to have acted because of concerns about the confidentiality of the information yet he immediately forwarded the first email to terrelle pryors mentor on december   ohio state was notified by the department of justice that it had in its possession many items of ohio state sports memorabilia seized from edward rifes tattoo parlor in the ensuing investigation tressel was questioned by ohio state on december  concerning his knowledge of the activities disclosed by the justice department the sale of rings jerseys and football memorabilia to rife tressel denied any specific knowledge of the violations and claimed that he could not remember who had given him the vague information a week later tressel exchanged text messages with cicero the attorney who had originally notified him of the activities back in april tressel verified that the justice department matter involved the same players and issues as the april emails tressel remained silent his longtime knowledge of the violations and his subsequent intentional fielding of ineligible players throughout the season was only revealed when ohio state inadvertently discovered the april  cicero emails in an unrelated search in january  on march   it was announced that tressel requested ohio state athletic director gene smith that he extend his own suspension to the same number of games as his players smith accepted the request and as a result tressel would have missed the first five games of the  season “ no are you kiddingim just hoping the coach doesnt dismiss me ” — ohio state president gordon gee when asked whether he would fire tressel ohio state president gordon gee assured the public that tressel would not lose his job over the matter on april   the ncaa accused tressel of withholding information and lying to keep buckeyes players on the field in a notice of allegations sent to ohio state the ncaa charged that tressels actions were considered potential major violations which had permitted football studentathletes to participate in intercollegiate athletics while ineligible the report also said he failed to comport himself  with honesty and integrity and that he lied when he filled out a compliance form in september stating that he had no knowledge of ncaa violations by any of his players tressel later stated that he lied about the violations because he didnt want to jeopardize the fbis investigation against rife and also feared for his players safety despite his stated safety concerns tressel only briefly spoke with two players never inquired of the two if other players were involved and also in danger nor in his discussions with players ever mentioned mr rife the tattoo parlor or the selling of ohio state merchandise the ncaas report explicitly refuted the credibility of this excuse tressel resigned as ohio states head football coach on may   three days earlier sports illustrated reported that it had found evidence that the memorabiliafortattoos scandal dated back to at least the  national championship season and as many as  players were involved early on the morning of memorial day gee and smith called tressel back from his vacation in florida and asked for his resignation the columbus dispatch reported that gee had appointed a special committee to examine the scandals impact on the school it also reported that ohio state had been looking to cut ties with tressel for several weeks tressel said in a statement released by the university after meeting with university officials we agreed that it is in the best interest of ohio state that i resign as head football coach the appreciation that ellen and i have for the buckeye nation is immeasurable luke fickell previously codefensive coordinator and assistant head coach served as head coach for the  football season tressel left ohio state as the thirdwinningest coach in school history behind woody hayes and john cooper however on july   ohio state vacated all of its wins from the  season and placed the football program on two years probation on december   the ncaa placed ohio state on an additional one years probation and banned it from postseason play in  for numerous major violations under tressels watch it also imposed a fiveyear showcause penalty on tressel which means any ncaa member that wants to hire him would have to show cause for why it shouldnt be sanctioned for hiring him and could face severe penalties if he commits any further violations during that time the order stood until december   given past precedent this likely had the effect of blackballing tressel from the coaching ranks until the  season had tressel coached during this period he would have been suspended for the first five games of the regular season plus any conference championship game or bowl game indianapolis coltsedit on september   tressel was hired by the indianapolis colts as a gamedayreplay consultant tressel was suspended by the colts until the th game of the season due to his involvement in the ncaa violations during his tenure as head coach at ohio state administrative careeredit university of akronedit on february   tressel accepted a nonathleticdepartment position where he started his coaching career the university of akron tressels new title was vice president for student success vice president for strategic engagement return to youngstown state universityedit in january  various media reports stated that tressel would possibly return to youngstown state to replace retiring university president cynthia anderson as the next president of the university while tressel is still revered in the area a new athletic training complex bearing his name the watson and tressel training site opened on campus in  tressels highest level of education is a masters degree a doctorate is virtually a prerequisite for any university president position in the united states combined with the showcause penalty that is in effect for tressel until  on paper it would have been a tough sell for ysu to bring back tressel supporters for bringing back tressel also cited this but mentioned that as university president his primary job would be for fundraising in which tressel had previously excelled over the years as head coach at both ysu and ohio state on may   randy dunn was chosen as successor to anderson but only stayed on the job for seven months ultimately leaving for southern illinois university after dunns sudden departure tressels name again came up for the position with tressel officially applying for the position on april   while simultaneously still being one of  candidates for the university of akron presidents job nearly a month later on may   the ysu board of trustees offered tressel the university president position after a unanimous vote after which tressel accepted the position as ysus new president and announced he was officially retired

star quarterback terrelle pryor ineligible to play for portions of the  season tressel was first notified of the arrangement in april  when he received several emails from chris cicero a local attorney and former ohio state walkon football player tressel never forwarded the emails nor the information contained in them about potential violations to his schools compliance office or the ncaa although tressel had held the position of athletic director at youngstown state tressels excuse was that he did not know whom to contact when he learned of the alleged violations tressel also later claimed not to have acted because of concerns about the confidentiality of the information yet he immediately forwarded the first email to terrelle pryors mentor on december   ohio state was notified by the department of justice that it had in its possession many items of ohio state sports memorabilia seized from edward rifes tattoo parlor in the ensuing investigation tressel was questioned by ohio state on december  concerning his knowledge of the activities disclosed by the justice department the sale of rings jerseys and football memorabilia to rife tressel denied any specific knowledge of the violations and claimed that he could not remember who had given him the vague information a week later tressel exchanged text messages with cicero the attorney who had originally notified him of the activities back in april tressel verified that the justice department matter involved the same players and issues as the april emails tressel remained silent his longtime knowledge of the violations and his subsequent intentional fielding of ineligible players throughout the season was only revealed when ohio state inadvertently discovered the april  cicero emails in an unrelated search in january  on march   it was announced that tressel requested ohio state athletic director gene smith that he extend his own suspension to the same number of games as his players smith accepted the request and as a result tressel would have missed the first five games of the  season “ no are you kiddingim just hoping the coach doesnt dismiss me ” — ohio state president gordon gee when asked whether he would fire tressel ohio state president gordon gee assured the public that tressel would not lose his job over the matter on april   the ncaa accused tressel of withholding information and lying to keep buckeyes players on the field in a notice of allegations sent to ohio state the ncaa charged that tressels actions were considered potential major violations which had permitted football studentathletes to participate in intercollegiate athletics while ineligible the report also said he failed to comport himself  with honesty and integrity and that he lied when he filled out a compliance form in september stating that he had no knowledge of ncaa violations by any of his players tressel later stated that he lied about the violations because he didnt want to jeopardize the fbis investigation against rife and also feared for his players safety despite his stated safety concerns tressel only briefly spoke with two players never inquired of the two if other players were involved and also in danger nor in his discussions with players ever mentioned mr rife the tattoo parlor or the selling of ohio state merchandise the ncaas report explicitly refuted the credibility of this excuse tressel resigned as ohio states head football coach on may   three days earlier sports illustrated reported that it had found evidence that the memorabiliafortattoos scandal dated back to at least the  national championship season and as many as  players were involved early on the morning of memorial day gee and smith called tressel back from his vacation in florida and asked for his resignation the columbus dispatch reported that gee had appointed a special committee to examine the scandals impact on the school it also reported that ohio state had been looking to cut ties with tressel for several weeks tressel said in a statement released by the university after meeting with university officials we agreed that it is in the best interest of ohio state that i resign as head football coach the appreciation that ellen and i have for the buckeye nation is immeasurable luke fickell previously codefensive coordinator and assistant head coach served as head coach for the  football season tressel left ohio state as the thirdwinningest coach in school history behind woody hayes and john cooper however on july   ohio state vacated all of its wins from the  season and placed the football program on two years probation on december   the ncaa placed ohio state on an additional one years probation and banned it from postseason play in  for numerous major violations under tressels watch it also imposed a fiveyear showcause penalty on tressel which means any ncaa member that wants to hire him would have to show cause for why it shouldnt be sanctioned for hiring him and could face severe penalties if he commits any further violations during that time the order stood until december   given past precedent this likely had the effect of blackballing tressel from the coaching ranks until the  season had tressel coached during this period he would have been suspended for the first five games of the regular season plus any conference championship game or bowl game indianapolis coltsedit on september   tressel was hired by the indianapolis colts as a gamedayreplay consultant tressel was suspended by the colts until the th game of the season due to his involvement in the ncaa violations during his tenure as head coach at ohio state administrative careeredit university of akronedit on february   tressel accepted a nonathleticdepartment position where he started his coaching career the university of akron tressels new title was vice president for student success vice president for strategic engagement return to youngstown state universityedit in january  various media reports stated that tressel would possibly return to youngstown state to replace retiring university president cynthia anderson as the next president of the university while tressel is still revered in the area a new athletic training complex bearing his name the watson and tressel training site opened on campus in  tressels highest level of education is a masters degree a doctorate is virtually a prerequisite for any university president position in the united states combined with the showcause penalty that is in effect for tressel until  on paper it would have been a tough sell for ysu to bring back tressel supporters for bringing back tressel also cited this but mentioned that as university president his primary job would be for fundraising in which tressel had previously excelled over the years as head coach at both ysu and ohio state on may   randy dunn was chosen as successor to anderson but only stayed on the job for seven months ultimately leaving for southern illinois university after dunns sudden departure tressels name again came up for the position with tressel officially applying for the position on april   while simultaneously still being one of  candidates for the university of akron presidents job nearly a month later on may   the ysu board of trustees offered tressel the university president position after a unanimous vote after which tressel accepted the position as ysus new president and announced he was officially retired from coaching head coaching recordedit year team overall conference standing
