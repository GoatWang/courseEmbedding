herein referred to as age will be acquiring advanced gamings associates herein referred to as aga in the rd quarter of  at closing aga will receive new shares in age equal to about  of outstanding shares of ages common stock at closing aga will also receive a  year  note for mm in principal prior to closing of the transaction age intents to make a  cash distribution to its existing shareholders in addition if certain new product revenue targets are satisfied in  years aga will get new shares in age such that agas shares will be  of outstanding shares and if certain service revenue targets are met the initial note with a mm principal will increase by an additional mm age has divested most of its business and is currently only in the business of the distribution of service of electronic components which consists of gaming supplies and components aga is in the business of providing turnkey solutions to gaming industry specifically installing and maintaining slot machines mr tomasello agas ceo will serve as interim ceo and receive a base salary of k a bonus of  of the companys ebitda upon the company exceeding k in ebitda for the first  calendar months after closing and other standard benefits shareholders are not given much information on aga according to wgatoacquireadvancedgamingassociateshtml relnofollowthis press release shareholders were told aga generated mm in revenue last year it is unclear what assets aga will bring over in the merger however given that agas business does not seem capital intensive it seems this amount should be low there is also some uncertainty of the earnings power of aga below is my estimate of the post merger balance sheet  and post merger economic ownership my estimates are based on the  balance sheet after which i took into account what i think the balance sheet will look like in  specifically making assumptions on the merger expense burn rate special dividend and agas net asset at todays market cap of mm investors are paying x book value note my calculation does not include mm of net operating losses that are off balance sheet the  income statement was created using the margins for fy  for continuing operations sales is estimated at mm since age shareholders will have a  ownership interest net income attributed towards this group is k giving a pe of  overall the transaction seems to make sense both companies have worked together in the past new management is incentivized on multiple fronts and some cost synergies will emerge public company expense allocated across a larger company there also may be an opportunity for cross selling by the new companys sales force as mr spier mentioned when age entered into a subdistribution agreement with aga in  we also expect to market and sell agas other products including its design installation and maintenance services for casinos wga looks interesting however at share investors should wait for lower prices disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks
