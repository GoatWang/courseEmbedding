corporation in which cadence claimed avanti stole cadence code and avanti denied it according to business week the avanti case is probably the most dramatic tale of whitecollar crime in the history of

mentor purchased rights to an aptix patent then sued cadence in this case the ceo of aptix amr mohsen forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger when suspicions were raised he staged a breakin of his own car to get rid of the evidence resulting in charges of obstruction of justice trying to avoid this he attempted to flee the country only to be caught with an illegal passport and a pile of cash while in jail for this offense he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge in order to fight the new charges he tried to feign psychological problems but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense and how it might be done he was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency but was convicted anyway according to the lawyers concerned the original notebooks were not needed for the trial the patent filing date which was not in dispute would have sufficed acquisitionsedit timelineedit may  acquired cooper

a pile of cash while in jail for this offense he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge in order to fight the new charges he tried to feign psychological problems but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense and how it might be done he was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency but was convicted anyway according

a pile of cash while in jail for this offense he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge in order to fight the new charges he tried to feign psychological problems but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense and how it might be done he was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency but was convicted anyway according

software to interoperate with the companys tools lawsuitsedit avanti corporationedit main article cadence design systems inc v avanti corp cadence was involved in a yearlong legal dispute with avanti corporation in which cadence claimed avanti stole cadence code and avanti denied it according to business week the avanti case is probably the most dramatic tale of whitecollar crime in the history of silicon valley the avanti executives eventually pleaded no contest and cadence received several hundred million dollars in restitution avanti was then purchased by synopsys which paid  million more to settle the remaining claims the case resulted in a number of legal precedents mentor graphicsedit the cadence group quickturn was also involved in a series of legal events with mentor graphicsaptix mentor purchased rights to an aptix patent then sued cadence in this case the ceo of aptix amr mohsen forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger when suspicions were raised he staged a breakin of his own car to get rid of the evidence resulting in charges of obstruction of justice trying to avoid this he attempted to flee the country only to be caught with an illegal passport and a pile of cash while in jail for this offense he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge in order to fight the new charges he tried to feign psychological problems but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense and how it might be done he was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency but was convicted anyway according to the lawyers concerned the original notebooks were not needed for the trial the patent filing date which was not in dispute would have sufficed acquisitionsedit timelineedit may  acquired cooper
