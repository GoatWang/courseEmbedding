investor relations products general results literature about newsroom low vol high div is the new black how can investors potentially generate income and grow their assets low vol high div strategies are the new black for many savvy investors september   the summer of the surprise brexit vote is over and the fall of an equally unexpected us election is upon us many equity markets are at alltime highs several bond markets are mired at historical lows and global expectations for economic growth are tepid at best what should spenders do investors near or in retirement they want income today and probably a little more growth for tomorrow especially as they are living longer what should younger savers do they want to build assets more than ever due to concerns about social security benefits and traditional pension plans being a thing of the past for most  the key for investment managers and financial advisors is to keep both groups in the markets over the short term while trying to limit their potential downside both groups are justly wary of big risks in the wake of the financial crisis what will happen when interest rates rise how will investors prepare this creates the backdrop for a perennial problem facing us investors how can they generate income while still continuing to harness opportunities to grow their hardearned assets to meet their life goals and objectives qs investors a legg mason affiliate based in new york has a strategy “low vol high div” low volatility and high dividend strategies are emerging as potentially attractive substitutes for the classic utility stocks of yore they can offer relatively low risk positions that can be less exposed to us equity market swings yet seek to pay regular dividends to support income objectives “in this unpredictable climate there are woefully few attractive dependable lowrisk options for investors seeking solid income” observed qs investors president james h norman “our parents’ and grandparents’ generations could steadily plow their savings into utility stocks they were viewed as safe typically paid regular dividends and appreciated in value nicely with the market sadly with deregulation of their industries those popular options have become more treacherous making it important to find another path through a mine field yet investors still need income somewhere without taking undue risks” “we believe that high yield managed volatility strategies can be a core holding of incomeoriented portfolios” mr norman said “they can also receive meaningful allocations in conservative and aggressive portfolios with long investment horizons” as chief investment officer of qs investors rosemary macedo notes living longer with more years in our retirement amplifies the impact of our investment choices and the safety net of social security shows signs of fraying making the prudent person wary of reliance clearly the stakes are higher than ever for both retirees and those who hope to retire one day to achieve high growth investors must take on risk but simply ratcheting up equity allocations exposes investors not just to more market volatility but also to more panic risk – the instinctive reaction to flee the market after a large loss right at the time investors should consider holding strong how to provide the growth investors need generate income without precluding growth and do so with enough relative stability to keep clients invested through down markets so that they participate in up markets the old strategy the utility of utilities for decades utility stocks were the standard answer to this perennial challenge  it was for good reason that advisors traditionally put ‘widows and orphans’ and other conservative investors’ savings into utility stocks  they produced income plus modest real principal growth with the relative stability that came with regulated industries  these included electric gas and water utilities as well as telephones in the days of the att monopoly although us government and aaa corporate bonds also offered income and nominal safety the higher risk of utility stocks compared with bonds was deemed to be worth bearing since bonds could not match utilities’ principal growth potential and inflation management  but utilities were not immune to the reality that industries and markets can experience significant disruption in this case deregulation opened the door to changes that fundamentally altered the nature of utility stocks  seeking a better return on investment utility companies’ management took advantage of deregulation by “diworsifying” into unrelated businesses examples include southern california gas with thrifty drug stores and arizona public service with mera bank  while not all diversification turned out badly the utilities sector was no longer a pure play on a regulated industry but rather a mix of the regulated transmission and the unregulated generators of the diversified and the not  this invited market speculation as some utilities pursued returns more aggressively including according to fortune magazine americas most innovative company ie enron   the new strategy for investors form follows function – defensive yield nowadays investors have to be more enterprising to get income plus growth with relative stability  the attributes investors liked in regulated utilities still exist though not all utilities have these characteristics today and not all stocks with these characteristics are utilities  we can systematically seek out the stocks with lower volatility and higher dividend yield in any market sector and with them build a broader more diversified portfolio that explicitly focuses on the tried and true benefits of lower volatility and higher dividend stocks the combination of lower volatility and higher dividend yield can be far more powerful than either attribute alone and produces a distinct investment strategy much as blue and yellow produce the distinct color green  by combining these characteristics we can mitigate or even avoid the pitfalls of each when used individually  for example emphasizing high dividend yields effectively excludes any low volatility stocks that are fundamentally expensive  retirees should consider this kind of strategy as they are living longer are less likely to have a pension and bond yields are at secular lows so should savers of any age who can benefit from the higher total returns associated with higher yield stocks as well as from the compounding benefits of lower volatility learn more about legg mason low volatility high
