of your customers immediate medical expenses such as the ambulance ride and emergency room visit insurance companies offer immediate medical expense coverage because its often cheaper to pay a little money up front rather than a lot of money in a lawsuit down the road but if the customer refuses your assistance and opts to sue instead you have a second line of defense your policy can help cover the cost of hiring a lawyer to negotiate and settle the case or take it to trial to summarize for thirdparty injuries general liability insurance can cover… immediate medical expenses lawyers fees

ruined customer smartphones thirdparty property damage n a catchall phrase for client customer or vendor property lost or damaged on your premises if you damage someones property you may have to pay to repair or replace it in some cases you dont even have to touch something to be responsible for its damage thirdparty property damage example a customer slips in your store and sends his smartphone flying his phone wouldnt be broken if he hadnt slipped and he wouldnt have slipped if you had mopped up that puddle so he wants you to pay for the broken phone some other examples you might accidentally spill your coffee on a clients laptop thats a cool  down the drain or maybe your office buildings fire spreads to a neighboring business imagine paying to repair an entire building when your business is already reeling from the disaster thats where small business liability insurance becomes crucial commercial general liability insurance in action business liability insurance cant keep accidents from happening however it can help cushion the blow by paying to repair or replace someones property you lost or damaged thirdparty property damage protection may cover… repair costs
