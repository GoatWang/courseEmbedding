was a mile railroad serving a single customer in upstate new york the company has since grown to be a leading owner and operator of short line and regional freight railroads serving more than  customers over  miles of track in five countries the original mile railroad is purchased out of bankruptcy by edward l fuller and his financial partners to transport salt from their mine in western new york state the mine in retsof ny would become the largest producing rock salt mine in the world and the company became the international salt corporation the railroad renamed the genesee and wyoming railroad company gnwr continues as a separate independent business mortimer b fuller iii great grandson of edward l fuller purchases a controlling interest in gwrr – still a mile railroad serving principally one customera holding company genesee  wyoming industries is formed and the gwrr merged into it to facilitate diversification of the business the company enters the rail car leasing and management business primarily focused on covered hoppers to serve the salt industry the staggers act deregulates railroads which are then allowed to dispose of routes that they could not operate profitably helping to restore their financial health locally fuller works with nydot the bo and dh in the restructuring of conrail and the rail system serving international salt then the largest rail shipper in new york state he learns the contribution that small railroads can make to improving rail system efficiency at a time when the industry is struggling and constrained by lack of capital for investment – during poststaggers act restructuring gw’s acquisitions are  domestic including the  purchase of rail link today a leading provider of industrial switching and port rail
