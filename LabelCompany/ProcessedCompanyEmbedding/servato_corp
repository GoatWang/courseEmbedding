managementactive battery management is servato’s term for a complete battery maintenance regimen that utilizes cutting edge technology to improve battery health automate processes and generate savings it is more than simple battery monitoring manualtechnicians perform manual tests on a cycle perhaps seasonally or every  months periodic manual tests with long periods of time without state of health data requires two site visits one to find the bad battery a second to replace it limited information to act on during outages relies on spreadsheets or notebooks to store data results in replacing full strings for one bad battery floatcharging keeps batteries ready but overcharges and accelerates failure time consuming expensive wasteful monitoringsensors are placed on the batteries to measure and record data provides realtime data accuracy is limited by floatcharging no ability to control the way batteries are charged to extend life often have limited software functionality floatcharging keeps batteries ready but overcharges and accelerates failure alerts for failed batteries outages and other issues managementservato’s appliances and software are used to test charge and manage batteries remotely all conventional monitoringonly alerts plus more works with your rectifier to control the charge of the batteries extending life only charges when necessary rests batteries  of the time more rest means less heat generated by batteries reducing cooling costs measurements from rested batteries provide more accurate data predictive analytics and signatures allow for early detection of failures resting batteries are always available for instantaneous backup power with electronic switching the most complete remote management solution on the market the servato difference – control charge for better data and extended life servato’s dc management platformasaservice offers companies more ways to generate capital and operational savings because our products go much deeper than conventional monitoring products most battery monitoring devices sit passively on the batteries recording and transmitting data but they have no ability to remotely change the way the batteries are managed servato’s appliances connect in line with the rectifier and the batteries to control the charge resting the batteries when necessary and charging when it is needed no other companies offers this same unique patented ability more than monitoringservato is the only company with battery monitoring appliances that have the ability to also manage charge the batteries instead of just recording battery health data firmware on the appliances uses proprietary algorithms to adaptively charge ensuring that batteries are not overcharged thus extending battery life what makes servato appliances unique extend battery lifewhen batteries spend more time at rest but are still frequently and properly charged their lifespan is lengthened servato has conducted laboratory and field tests that have proved our unique ability to extend battery life for v vrla batteries we have other resources available detailing the science of what we do check out the data on battery life extension magnified savingsfloatcharging not only overcharges the batteries and contributes to a faster decline it uses more electricity than necessary heat generated by the batteries also raises cooling needs in cabinets and remote cos by adaptively charging batteries servato can save companies on electricity and cooling case studies  utilize the internet of things for site managment taking full advantage of the internet of things iot revolution servato equips technicians with the ability to monitor and manage more than just batteries we are working to put an end to unnecessary truck rolls detect hidden equipment issues rectifier issues can go undetected but still have an adverse affect on batteries because of the uniqueness of servato’s hardware the smart power system appliances are the only ones capable of detecting certain issues learn about how servato was able to detect a faulty controller module generator monitoring coming soon the sps product line will soon include the ability to monitor the start stop and use of generators at critical sites knowing the generators have kicked on is just as important as being aware of the batteries enivronmental conditions with a usb
