just dumped his chief of staff reince priebusyelp founder jeremy stoppelman loves to cook his kitchen counters are stacked with cookbooks photo joe pugliese under yelp ceo jeremy stoppelman ignored advice from peter thiel and elon musk and succeeded anywaydaniel robertssep  when jeremy stoppelman was applying to harvard business school in  he asked his boss at paypal elon musk to write him a letter of recommendationi dont think jeremy needs to go to harvard musk recalls typing i just want to make that clear my personal recommendation is that he doesnt go stoppelman got in and attended anyway only to drop out a year later so he could start yelp a userdriven businessreview service with his friend russ simmonssince then yelp yelp has grown into a multinational publicly traded company with  employees and a market cap of  billion twice stoppelman has rejected offers to buy yelp first for a reported  million from google goog then for  billion from yahoo yhoo in july the san franciscobased company bought seatme a reservations service that competes with the likes of opentable open for  million secondquarter  revenue of  million exceeded expectations traffic is at an alltime high up  year over year outside the us  the library of yelp reviews now stands at  million and the site has  million monthly uniques  more people than ever in over  cities visit yelp to find the best dim sum dry cleaner dermatologist or dog parkdespite a robust user base an international footprint and an aggressive push into advertising sales yelp like so many other internet darlings has yet to turn a profit its a bit of a trope a young ambitious founderceo stoppelman is  and no  on our  under  list who has taken the long view against critics clamoring for a quicker path to profitability but thats exactly who stoppelman is and thats the lengthy course he has set for his companyrelatedapplebozoma saint john leaving apple report saysapplebozoma saint john leaving apple report saysmuch of yelps success is due to its users  the website is only as valuable as its content and it has content only if people actively participate as such when yelp opens in a new market abroad it does so by hiring scouts to build up a library of reviews then adding community managers to spread the word the maneuver is not cheap although it has earned yelp kudos as one of the first web companies to expand citybycity via ontheground efforts  now the norm for many other convenience startups such as uber and airbnb yelp launched in brazil new zealand and the czech republic this year and stoppelman says yelp could be profitable if we did reduce our investment in the business the second thorn is even thornier getting small businesses to advertise on yelp small businesses invest  billion a year in the yp real yellow pages and the companys digitaladvertising business had seven times yelps revenue in  yelp needs to bite into that pie and to do so its aggressively ramping up its adsales staff which currently includes about half of all yelp staffers right now only  small businesses advertise with yelp out of some  million in the usthere is however some controversy surrounding just how yelp earns new customers do its search results favor businesses that pay to advertise might it punish those that decline yelps review filter which is meant to weed out artificial reviews both positive such as a friend giving another friends business five stars and negative competitors slamming one another has drawn much of the ire during a yelp town hall in hollywood in august a number of people stood to complain that after they declined to advertise their best reviews disappeared stoppelman insists unequivocally that advertising has nothing to do with the review filter salespeople have no ability to do anything with reviews  never have never will he says some sales reps at yelp suggest that wouldbe customers often learn about yelp during a sales call and decline to advertise but then solicit friends to quickly write fivestar reviews the system then spots those reviews and filters them outyelps challenge is to prove to businesses they can get more from the company if they pay for its services than they can by using it for free this summer yelp launched yelp platform which allows users to order food directly from the website or app as a result yelp can fish for new business by sharing these leads such as how many people called a restaurant clicked its website or looked up directions from within yelps listing yelp platform is the first significant ecommerce offering from yelp as jefferies analyst brian fitzgerald says not only do you cull the reviews but you help that business book tables  you help it get customers theres a whole suite of products there that could be integrated it could unseat opentable and yet what is free on yelp is still what is most compelling about  million business owners far more than the  that pay are utilizing yelps suite of free tools which they can access by claiming their owner page at bizyelpcom rakesh agrawal an analyst at redesign mobile says utilizing yelps free tools is one of the best things you can do for your small business but hes less impressed with its advertising services he has shorted the stock the thing i highly recommend for businesses is instead of giving your money to yelp give your time stoppelmans goal is to build a product so compelling that they will do bothstoppelman is sitting in on a product meeting in levchins the conference room named after max levchin the paypal cofounder who gave yelp an early  million investment stoppelman is dressed in j crew head to toe hes friends with the retailers ceo mickey drexler who persuaded stoppelman to come in for a full fitting when he was in new york in todays meeting he and a few engineers are considering the look of a screen on yelps mobile app one that shows up after customers check in somewhere one engineer shows a possible response after a user visits a store and answers a question about the experience dolla dolla bills yall that was fun lets try another reads the screen stoppelman says can we do a  sound effect like obviously we could have chaching  the group laughsstoppelman isnt the most gregarious guy  its not my first thought to go out and meet people he says he is quiet reserved and prone to pick up new hobbies with scholarly singlemindedness he taught himself guitar by watching videos online but around the office he loosens up miriam warren vice president of new markets says that over time ive seen him get more comfortable in his own skin he sends out weekly videos to the entire staff called the stoppelblog to give short company updates stoppelmans younger brother michael yelps vp of engineering is the opposite chatty animated around the office they call him mstop jeremy has no nicknameand yet in a business setting he has always been anything but shy at paypal he was unafraid to speak out and its something he encourages yelp employees to do regardless of rank perhaps it is a residual from being surrounded by extremely competitive ambitious leaders like musk thiel and levchin when he was just a young engineer not long out of the university of illinois the way he moved up the ladder at paypal levchin says was that he was very selfassured which is pretty impressive for someone in his early twenties once stoppelman sent an angry email around critiquing a new feature he clearly thought that he was being brash or sort of telling the man levchin says and a whole bunch of us on the executive team were like oh crap hes totally right we have to go change this he had absolutely no problem criticizing people above him and being blunt about itnowadays he is equally demanding and obsessive about yelp his baby in the early days of the company he once scolded keith rabois now a yelp boardmember for wearing a yelp tshirt to the gym rabois protested that he was promoting the company but stoppelman told him it was a highquality vintage tshirt and that he shouldnt damage the brand by working out in ithe was similarly concerned with establishing a culture at yelp  one that he likes to say isnt a burnout culture the workplace is far from the showy funhouses of other buzzy tech startups it is not a company that lures employees with perks were not google stoppelman says we dont have lobster stuffed with caviar every day its never been about how we compete on throwing nice things at employees indeed a large fridge in its modest cafeteria is filled comically with only condiments and sliced deli meats employees play chef fixing yelpwiches for lunch a flier on the fridge in august also posted all over the san francisco offices announces the great yelp move is upon us and encourages employees to remove food before the entire staff relocates a few blocks away to new larger offices on new montgomery street it does not have an intense culture at all rabois says whereas clearly at paypal we did i get the impression tesla does you create your own custom cocktail yelps cocktail is an engineerdriven team passionate about the wonky parts but with a playful side colleagues say that stoppelman knows his strengths  product and engineering  and focuses on themtodays product meeting is focused on yelps fastestgrowing and arguably most important slice the mobile app mobile sees  of all yelps traffic that goes up to  on weekends and  of all searches people are using mobile more thus it is one of three companywide themes for the year the other two are its international expansion with a strong emphasis on integrating traffic from qype the german competitor yelp acquired for  million a year ago and you guessed it selling more ads internally theyre calling it closing the loop with local businesses but competition in the mobilead space is fierce and some critics say that though yelp was an early leader in mobile it waited too long on mobile advertising it didnt start selling display ads in its app until march and while  of ads show up on mobile it could have been higher by nowin june google launched carousel a localsearch product that displays a ticker of businesses and seems squarely aimed at yelp yelp relies on google for more than half of its traffic but stoppelman says that worries him less and less even as theyve gotten increasingly aggressive in trying to put roadblocks in front of consumers in getting to the yelp content in addition to google there is facebook  in august it launched graph search which offers you up restaurants your friends have liked its really google and facebook who are their main competitors for local advertising dollars online says wunderlich analyst blake harper who believes the biggest risk for yelp is that customers turn to one of these giants because they dont like yelps tactics or the way they filter reviews below those dual behemoths there are competitors like tripadvisor which focuses on hotelsif it isnt an alreadyestablished giant perhaps the company to build the next mousetrap that stoppelman says he fears will be a brand new startup an unimagined competitor peter thiel an early investor and another mentor of stoppelmans from their paypal days says that google isnt worth worrying about if a much bigger company was going to be able to take them out they already would have done so its not that easy to build these local communities in every city indeed it seems as though stoppelmans focus on investing in communities and building a product that delights users both customers and business owners outweighs his concern with profitability thiel says he thinks yelp will still be around in  if it is it will likely be because stoppelman ignored the quick path to profits in favor of the slow climb toward an involved user baseof course stoppelman has ignored advice from his sages before  once with musk and again with thiel in  he and thiel were out for a run something they used to do a few times a year at some critical inflection point for the business thiel says and they got to talking about the state of yelp stoppelman was considering taking his company public thiel told him not to of course the rest is history stoppelman did and yelps stock which made its debut at  a share in march  is now around  up  from a year agoa shorter version of this story
