diversification account holdings can be further customized when necessary or desirable ― for example to manage tax liabilities or maintain exposure to a favorite security client portfolios are managed on site by our investment professionals we do not hire third parties to manage client assets or make decisions about client portfolios  valueoriented equity strategy valueoriented equity strategy highquality fixed income strategy highquality fixed income strategy when selecting equities we aim to purchase stocks trading at a discount to key measures of a company’s financial strength or at prices that are temporarily below the stock’s normal price range by attempting to not overpay for stocks we may gain some protection if stock markets decline additionally many of the stocks we select pay a dividend that adds to portfolio returns still others exhibit growth characteristics that may make them more valuable over time when selecting bonds we generally stay true to our relatively conservative approach to investing and focus primarily on investmentgrade taxable and taxfree securities from time to time we complement these with noninvestment grade securities that in our view present little risk of depreciation downside risk and have strong prospects for receiving creditratings upgrades and appreciating in value   is blbb right for you call us socialize search call us
