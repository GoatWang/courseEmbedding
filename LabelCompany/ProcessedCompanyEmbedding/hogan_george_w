michael boehm robert johnson inception  manufacturer spectrum brands available united states united kingdom ireland canada australia website george foreman us george foreman uk a george foreman grill the george foreman lean mean fatreducing grilling machine commonly known as the george foreman grill is an indoor electrically heated grill manufactured by spectrum brands it is promoted by former boxing champion george foreman since its introduction in  over  million george foreman grills have been sold worldwide contents  history  design  reception  competition  in popular culture  see also  references  external links historyedit the concept for the grill was created by michael boehm of batavia illinois the original intention was to create an indoor grill that would provide a unique benefit of cooking on both sides at once a second key benefit was to reduce the fat content of hamburgers and other meats by draining away the fat into a separate reservoir michael boehm designed the product with a floating hinge and slanted grilling surface to accommodate foods of different thicknesses and drain fat away from the food engineering work was done by bob johnson the grill had been promoted at industry trade shows in the early s but received little interest the slanted grill concept was pitched by tsann kuen to salton inc salton sent samples of the grill to george foremans colleagues who then sent the grill to foreman to test out boehm had nothing to do with teaming up the grill and foreman the lean mean fatreducing grilling machine as it became known was introduced in  and promoted with distinctive infomercials which featured foreman a combination of his affable personality and the unique features of the product made it a huge success such was the popularity of these infomercials that foremans famous tagline its so good i put my name on it is now part of popular culture in asia the grill is endorsed and promoted by both george foreman and jackie chan designedit the product has a clamshell design which simultaneously heats the top and bottom surfaces of the food eliminating the need to flip it each heating surface is grooved to reduce contact area and covered in a nonstick coating the lower heating surface is angled to allow melted fat and other fluids to drain through the grooves into a removable drip tray which clearly shows the amount removed from the food this arrangement has been marketed as a way to knock out the fat suggesting a healthier way to cook the grill is offered in various sizes for cooking individual or multiple servings in  the george foreman next grilleration health grill was launched which features detachable grilling plates for easier cleaning it has gone through several other versions differing in their control interfaces and design receptionedit the worldwide popularity of the george foreman grill has resulted in sales of over  million units since it was first launched a feat that was achieved in a little over  years although foreman has never confirmed exactly how much he has earned from the endorsement salton inc paid him  million in  in order to buy out the right to use his name previous to that he was being paid about  of the profits on each grill sold earning him  million a month in payouts at its peak so it is estimated he has made a total of over  million from the endorsement a sum that is substantially more than he earned as a boxer competitionedit the success of the george foreman grill spawned a variety of similar celebrityendorsed products such as the evander holyfield real deal grill for which holyfield starred in a  infomercial the carl lewis health grill and the jackie chan grill which targets the asian market none of these imitators however achieved the level of success of the foreman grill in the vh show hogan knows best hulk hogan claimed that he was offered the contract for the grill first but missed his agents phone call because he was picking up the kids and thus missed out on the endorsement instead he endorsed a hulk hogan blender and later the hulk hogan ultimate grill in popular cultureedit on the nickelodeon television series drake  josh it was parodied as the gary coleman grill in us version of the office michael scott steps on a george foreman grill on the animated television series king of the hill the grill is a pivotal subject of the
