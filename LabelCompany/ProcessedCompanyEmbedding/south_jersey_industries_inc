jersey industries inc cash flow of  million this quarter easily pays the high dividend and leaves some cash left over to increase its infrastructure as its customer base increases being a regulated regional utility company there really are not any major competitors for their business directly south jersey industries inc has a dividend yield of  and its dividend has been increased for  of the last ten years easily meeting my guideline for dividend growth the average payout ratio of the dividend is high at  over  years the dividend is well above average for the market south jersey industries inc is therefore a dividend growth income investment but total return missed by about  average per year which considering the great steady above average growing dividend is not much to worry about south jersey industries inc last quarterly cash flow was at  million which leaves south jersey industries inc enough of cash allowing it to pay its high dividend and have some left over

with a target price of  south jersey industries inc is then slightly above fair price at present south jersey industries inc pe is bit high right now at  for their projected  earnings most large debt companies are at their highs right now because of the low interest rates on their large debt total return and yearly dividend the good business portfolio guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules when i look at a company the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the good business portfolio the total return guideline was just added to my list of guidelines south jersey industries inc slightly missed its total return in my  month test compared to the dow average i chose the  month test period starting january   and ending to date because it includes the great year of  and other years that had fair and bad performance modeling the dow average is not an objective of the portfolio but just happened by using the  guidelines as a filter for company selection the fair total return and high dividend makes south jersey industries inc a choice for the dividend growth income investor the dividend has been increased for  of the last ten years

its non utility operations into over two categories energy group and energy services energy group includes wholesale energy retail gas and other and retail electric operations energy services include onsite energy production and appliance service operations one of my guidelines is that the dividend should have increase in  of the last ten years sji has grown the dividend in each of the last ten years and has a annual dividend growth rate of  this makes sji a great dividend growth income company i would buy south jersey industries inc its growth is almost assured as the population grows and many existing homes are switching to gas the regulated utility business model also allows money spent for pipeline expansion to be included in the rate payers base reduction the stress on the cash flow in this quarter the company added  new customers showing that the company can grow as more people are switching to gas for their energy needs in may they also offered  million shares with the proceeds to be used for capital expenditures in the regulated business and for its utility business south jersey industries inc trys to be a good neighbor as shown in above graphic takeaways and
