prospectus and fund reports fact sheet profile sheet materials  resources investor guide  about risk bank loan risk there are a number of risks associated with an investment in bank loans including credit risk interest rate risk liquidity risk and prepayment risk lack of an active trading market restrictions on resale irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods may impair the funds ability to sell bank loans within its desired time frame or at an acceptable price and its ability to accurately value existing and prospective investments extended trade settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the fund as a result the fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions to raise cash to meet its obligations the risk of holding bank loans is also directly tied to the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuing banks these risks could cause the fund to lose income or principal on a particular investment which in turn could affect the funds returns the value of bank loans can be affected by and sensitive to changes in government regulation and to economic downturns in the united states and abroad bank loans generally are floating rate loans which are subject to interest rate risk as the interest paid on the floating rate loans adjusts periodically based on changes in widely accepted reference rates borrowing risk borrowing money to buy securities exposes the fund to leverage and will cause the funds share price to be more volatile because leverage will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the funds portfolio securities borrowing money may also require the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so in addition the fund will incur interest expenses and other fees on borrowed money there can be no assurance that the funds borrowing strategy will enhance and not reduce the funds returns changing fixed income market conditions risk the current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero there is a risk that interest rates will rise when the frb and central banks raise these rates this risk is heightened due to the completion of the frbs quantitative easing program and the tapering of other similar foreign central bank actions this eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs collateralized loan obligations risk clos are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress clos may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches market anticipation of defaults and investor aversion to clo securities as a class the risks of clos will be greater if the fund invests in clos that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the fund holds subordinate tranches of the clo that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches in addition clos are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk credit linked notes risk risks of credit linked notes include those risks associated with the underlying reference obligation including but not limited to market risk interest rate risk credit risk default risk and in some cases foreign currency risk an investor in a credit linked note bears counterparty risk or the risk that the issuer of the credit linked note will default or become bankrupt and not make timely payment of principal and interest of the structured security credit linked notes may be less liquid than other investments and therefore harder to dispose of at the desired time and price in addition credit linked notes may be leveraged and as a result small changes in the value of the underlying reference obligation may produce disproportionate losses to the fund debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event defaulted securities risk defaulted securities pose a greater risk that principal will not be repaid than nondefaulted securities defaulted securities and any securities received in an exchange for such securities may be subject to restrictions on resale derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions financial services sector risk the fund may be susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial services sector financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable interest rates each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such companies financial services companies may also have concentrated portfolios which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic conditions foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful high yield debt securities junk bond risk investments in high yield debt securities junk bonds and other lowerrated securities will subject the fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuers ability to pay interest and principal when due are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile liquidity risk the fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the funds securities become illiquid the fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value risk of subordinated debt perpetual subordinated debt is a type of hybrid instrument that has no maturity date for the return of principal and does not need to be redeemed by the issuer these investments typically have lower credit ratings and lower priority than other obligations of an issuer during bankruptcy presenting a greater risk for nonpayment this risk increases as the priority of the obligation becomes lower payments on these securities may be subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of subsidiaries and associated companies of an issuer additionally some perpetual subordinated debt does not restrict the ability of an issuer’s subsidiaries to incur further unsecured indebtedness as of  afrax nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is

the player in mutual fund investing the old adage that high costs indicate quality couldnt be further from the truth there is no proof that if you pay a higher fee youll get a higher return if anything the mutual fund manager of a highcost fund might take more risks in the attempt to produce a higher return  and of course this higher return is not a sure thing so if the managers risky moves dont pan out youve not only forked out more money in costs but youve also seen your portfolio value shrink from capital losses to avoid paying high fees only to suffer losses and to maximize your investment return it is important to consider which class of mutual fund shares is suitable for you and to know what kind of fees you will be paying when you invest in a mutual fund here we give an overview of these different classes what are mutual fund classes while stock classes indicate the number of voting rights per share mutual fund classes indicate the type and number of fees charged for the shares in a fund although mutual fund companies can have as many as seven or more classes of shares for a particular fund there are three main types of mutual fund classes that are most popular a b and c also known as ashares bshares and cshares each of these classes has various benefits and consequences lets examine each in turn classa shares classa shares charge a frontend load that is taken off your initial investment pros lower b fees  class a shares tend to have lower b fees so if you plan on holding these shares for several years a frontend load might be beneficial in the long run breakpoints  these provide a discount off regular frontend load rates each time your investment reaches a certain amount in a series if the first breakpoint is  you could invest that amount initially to receive the first discount to learn more read break free of fees with mutual fund breakpoints right of accumulation  this gives you the opportunity to receive a discount on the frontend load if you reach the first breakpoint with the second installment so again say that the first breakpoint is  and your initial investment is  if you invest  to reach the breakpoint on the second installment youd receive a discounted frontload fee letter of intent  some companies also offer frontend load discounts up front to individuals who initially express their intent to invest an amount over a certain breakpoint by a certain point in time cons high initial investment required  investors who do not have the funds to reach a breakpoint before the deadline indicated by a letter of intent will have to pay regular frontend fees long time horizon required  these funds are not optimal for investors with a short time horizon for example say your initial investment is  after  in frontload fees and your investment increases  during the course of a year if you liquidate at the end of the year you would have actually lost   or  class b shares these shares are classified by their backend or contingent deferred sales charge these shares are typically good for investors with little investment cash and a long investment horizon pros no frontend fees  your entire initial investment contribution earns interest income deferred sales charges  the longer you hold the shares the lower your deferred sales charge conversion to class a  class b shares automatically convert to class a shares after a certain period of time this is beneficial because class a shares have a lower yearly expense ratio than class b shares see below cons long time horizon required  if you withdraw funds within a certain period of time typically five to eight years you are a charged a backend or deferred sales charge no breakpoints  class b shares do not provide breakpoints on the deferred sales charge so regardless of how much you invest there is no discount on these charges higher expense ratios  class b shares charge higher expense ratios than both class a and c shares until shares are eligible to be converted to class a class c shares class c shares are a type of levelload fund this class works well for individuals who will be redeeming shares in the short term pros no frontend fees  your entire initial investment contribution earns interest income small backend load  the backend load is typically only  opportunity to avoid backend load  the backend load is normally removed after the shares have been held for one year cons backend load  a backend load  although small  is typically charged if funds are withdrawn within the first year higher expense raios  although the expense ratios of class c shares are lower than those of class b shares they are higher than those for class a shares no conversion  unlike class b shares class c shares cannot be converted into class a shares removing the opportunity for lower expense ratios as such if you have a long time horizon class c shares are not optimal for you as the high management fees are continuous that is your investment returns will be reduced the longer you stay invested because the fees will add up considerably over time no discounts  class c shares do not offer discounts on expenses when the account reaches certain levels applying the pros and cons lets look at how the characteristics and pros and cons described above work in the following share classes of the index plus midcap mutual fund shares offered by ing ing

and ing funds july   in this example you can see how each of these different share classes are better for different types of investors and situations if you plan on investing in this fund for retirement and your retirement is  years away class a or b shares would work best because they both offer declining costs the longer you stay invested also if you plan to invest just one lumpsum amount and it is enough to qualify for a breakpoint discount class a would be the best over time you would get a discount on the initial load and your yearly expenses the expense ratio and b fees are very low allowing your investment to grow with class b shares you are not charged an initial fee however you are charged a  expense ratio per year rather than  and you would need to keep invested for at least eight years before the class b shares convert to class a at the same time if you are planning to invest in the fund continuously class b may be better as each deposit is not charged class c shares would work best if you are planning to invest for a limited period optimally no less than one year in this way you avoid both front and backend loads although your expense ratio will normally be higher than class a shares your full investment will gain interest while it is invested to show you how class c shares work best for a shorterterm investment lets compare the returns of a oneyear investment of  in class a and the same kind of investment in class c shares class a  because  will be deducted for frontend fees the value of the initial investment is  after one year with a  return and  b fees the investment would then be worth   class c  there are no deductions for frontend loads and the backend load requirement expires after the year is up the value of a  investment with a  return and  b fees would be   note the difference  youve made  more with class c shares over a long period however class a shares would be more optimal the class cs higher b fee paid over the course of more than  years would eat into your returns to a point where class a shares would provide you with a higher return conclusion when deciding which class of mutual fund shares to choose remember to read the prospectus in addition you must take into account your investment horizon the amount you have to invest initially the frequency of your investments and the probability you will need to
