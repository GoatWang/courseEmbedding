first ride cycling weekly june   shares shares product overview overall rating score  prosclassic design attributesmodern components mean the bike isnt stuck in the sconsretro look may not please everyone product holdsworth professional first ride manufacturer holdsworth professional price as reviewed £ falcon cycles has reinvented the holdsworth professional the bike of the legendary holdsworthcampagnolo team of the s the new bike was redesigned from the ground up so that original details like the seatstay wrapover domeheaded rivets for the head badge and sloping campagstyle dropouts could be worked in there is a limited run of  each numbered separately with a down tube decal with a traditional lugged construction the frame is authentic in every way however a heavy steel fork threaded steerer and flexible quill stem is something nobody really wants so a carbonbladed fork with aluminium steerer has been discreetly sprayed the same orange as the steel frame for the groupset campagnolo athena is the only option in terms of aesthetics with its polished alloy chainset it has the vintage look but campagnolo’s bottom speed groupset is also a great performer black campag scirocco wheels match the t bar stem and seatpost and a white fizik pavé saddle and bar tape complete the pro look the holdsworth feels like a modern bike as its makers intended it has the unmistakable ride of a well made steel frame – just the right amount of ‘spring’ comfort and speed the ° parallel geometry and horizontal top tube are racy obviously it isn’t meant to be raced but i rode it to a topfive place in an earlyseason sportive and might have been faster if i hadn’t slowed down to acknowledge admiring comments verdict its a beautiful machine and i wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to fans of classic race bikes who want to ride them rather than look at them details barst ergosum pro alloy framereynolds  cromo lugged aprebic carbon fibre  in fork group setcampagnolo

supplierwwwfalconcyclescouk martin still love my ’s holdsworth professional – but i reckon’s it’s all black colour scheme is sexier than the orange 🙂 brian grundy i have a holdsworth cycle frame number  it is purple in colour and is in good condition the frame number is  can anyone give me its age and possible value thanks steve pratley i mum has my dads old holdsworth cycle that he had resprayed in the original colours it is a luggless frame and from the ’s i think my mum is looking at giving it away to someone to cycle to college on but i feel that it is too nice a bike for that it need a little tlc though can anyone tell me the best place to sell this for her and any idea on what its worth roughly  oliver hi anyone know the geometry data for the larger frame sizes   in particular i am looking for the seat angle head tube length etc thanks peter greaves great looking bike i bought a holdsworth pro frame new in  it cost me £ and raced on it for the next  years of course fitting it out with campag components the frames were heavy compared to carbon fibre but had a lovely feel were strong and very reliable buy a new one and the bike could last you  years or more not sure how long carbon fibre lasts but it must be getting better all the time susan latham great bikes my father fred latham manchester wheeler sprint champion  had one made in  which still has all original parts and i still ride recently completed the london to brighton race on it i would be interested to know what the value of this bike would be as iam considering selling with a view to updating martin itter hi i would love to own one of these bikes my first bike was a handmade custom built holdsworth ″ frame and ″ wheels i was only  years old at the time in  my father had it made for me as he knew sandy holdsworth i later progressed to a road racing machine ″ frame ″ wheels but i can’t remember the frames name i rode many races on it good to see my favourite bike name is still going best wishes martin itter ps my fathers name was peter itter founder member with charles messenger of the bcf rafael velez i own a holdsworth competition model that i raced in ’s i still ride it but over the years i’ve replaced the rims saddle and rear derailleur i was thrilled to see the new holdsworth and i wish i had the means to get one back to california but it just wasn’t meant to be i love british steel brooks saddles and campy that combination is the only way to ride hugh darcy lovely bike to see in production again and sorely tempted…i still ride my humble  holdsworth record which is silverblue and still in original paint the chainset is the only update otherwise as per sale spec noted a similar machine for sale at goodwood revival at the old bicyle shop rides well for a  year old kelvin trott as a young aspirational cylist in  my parents bought me the best bike they could afford which was the holdsworth professional at £ in  that was a fortune and they went to great lenghts to buy it for me at the age of   it is only now i can understand the sacfrices they made to buy me the machine i was deligted to buy number  of this current range and have enjoyed every moment of owning it its not a precise replica of the professional as there ate no chrome forks  but the machine has the same lines and colour and is a delight to ride i have bought my two sons the same machine in preference to many of the very bland models on sale today dennis creech i lived of annerley rd in the s early s and i remember there was a bike frame workshop in lullington rd penge i cant remember if they was for holdworthy or claud butlerthey knocked down all the victorian houses in the road in the late s and built a council estate i ended up getting a brand new flat there after getting married in  i think there was a bike shop in annerly rd towards crystal palace selling holdsworthy bikes good old days ehnice to hear from any others about this  dencreechaolcom charles holdsworth great to see holdsworths back on the road sandy holdsworth was my uncle and although i never joined the family cycle business i have followed it with interest all my like david horley fantastic to see the company colours on a machine once again i was service department manager for holdsworthy oaklands road penge for their final year before buyout and closure mr flannery will doubtless remember me i owned a classic tt campag super record throughout and also aquired the pattern classic frame from the workshop which was sprayed up in team colours and had chromed backstays and half forks  days after this was bought the rider lost control down annerley hill and the bike was written off i also had a friend who had a holdsworth equippe which was also finished in the same scheme but this really was at the budget end of the range i went from holdsworthy owners of the claud butler brand to work for geoffrey butlers in croydon so becoming one of the few to have worked under both brothers names anyway great to see the name and colours back where they belong – on the road david horley philip connor nice to see this new take on a classic bike i’m not sure the following is at all relevant but… i came across this review quite by chance my daily ride is my holdsworth pro which i boughtbuiltup new as a teenager starting with the frame which was my xmas present in  over the next year i fitted it out with a campag record strada groupset as and when funds allowed for the ’ season the hc team had  degree frames but these were discovered to be too twitchy and they resorted to  mine is a  and i can confirm it is as twitchy as a nervous squirrel as far as the bike being reviewed is concerned  pedantic i know but the ‘professional’ had a waterslide transfer head badge in order to save weight… i’d love to see one of the new incarnations in the flesh i hope they all find good homes philip david collins brings back great memories of my first good bike – a holdsworth pro from roy thame cycles in putney maybe  i think but it’s a pity falcon could not have used … david skarratts further to my last comments the biken  has now been featured in the new zealand road cyclist magazine oct  ed it is the only one in nz and i am a very proud owner rodders awesome looking bike and to be honest it’s just nice to see a manufacturer making bikes that look like this again mr sthall fantastic to see a holdsworth bike back on the road i used to work for wfholdsworth in penge between  in which time i met tony doyle rmc such a nice person to talk with the holdsworth bike looks fantasic a bit pricey  i would love to own one maybe my own bike is a mix of    reynolds tubing frameforks with campag record brakes  gearset it also has some upto date parts  it still going to day thanks for bringing back the memories ps brilliant ken manwaring very interested to see pro holdsworth as i have a card with a photos and names of the holdsworthcampagnolo team of early s and still in contact with alan bridges who road with them back then alan and i road with the mercury cc a long long time ago kind regards ken e manwaring noel in  the holdsworth shop in putney had a campag eqipped pro bike on displayto my utter disbelief it cost one hundred  eighty quid how could a bike cost so much but i did buy one a year later…secondhand i hope the new one is as good cheers noel david skarratts i have no of this ltd ed run unfortunately the bike was damaged in transit to nz due to poor packing and i have had to do some remedial paint work i have made some changes to make it look as ‘retro’ as it should always have been richey classic stem and vintage campag aero seat pin from ebay new brooks saddle in honey with copper rails and rivets agree with jonathan re the fork steel would have been nice especially if chromed my one concern is in regard to the rear dropouts as nice as they are it is very difficult to remove the rear wheel due to its proximity to the seat tube ok in the garage but tricky out on the road with a rear wheel puncture jonathan reynolds i had a frame handbuilt last year in reynolds  with campag centaur running gear it has a quill stem beautiful and steel forks supremely comfortable which apparently “nobody really wants” despite my preference for a heavy leather saddle and  spoke wheels it weighs just under  lbs and cost â£ the
