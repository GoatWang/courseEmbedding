are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization

luminous works of delicate almost kaleidoscopic color belie both the place of his upbringing and his physical appearance at over six feet tall he says “i was always a very quiet sensitive kid so what i look like is not necessarily indicative of what goes on inside” filled with images of birds flowers water and other natural objects mr goldberg’s intricate designs allow him he says “to bring out something that nothing else could there’s intimacy there’s love back in the postmodern day it wasn’t popular to be sincere or to paint something that could be good for us that has always been my intention—to make quiet intimate paintings” second tapestry  by glenn goldberg acrylic gesso ink and pencil on canvas  x  inches  x  cm jpmorgan chase art collection  glenn goldberg courtesy of the artist paintings that are built out born  in the bronx new york mr goldberg grew up not with art but with music “art was essentially nonexistent in my household but music was actually huge” his father introduced him to such jazz greats as ella fitzgerald tommy dorsey benny goodman and sara vaughan to this early jazz influence mr goldberg received training in contemporary art that emphasized structure “i was trained in terms of the bauhaus idea that you have to build a painting so i am interested in this combination of structure and improvisation” mr goldberg’s paintings are literally “built out” working at a table in his studio in brooklyn new york he creates his paintings from back to front “they are simply additive like life itself just as we move through our lives things might get quieted—we might forget or have resolved certain things” he says “they’re akin to how life moves forward” a hybrid of representative and abstract forms mr goldberg’s artwork often starts with a pattern reminiscent of textiles he will then fill in an area or little compartment with an image that may be overt or “have some kind of implication but we couldn’t be sure what they are” and he will repeat a pattern exploring its variations “it feels quite natural to do another one or to do a different one and the questions are always ‘what’s possible what could i do’” there  by glenn goldberg oil on canvas  x  inches  x  cm jpmorgan chase art collection  glenn goldberg courtesy of the artist the greatest gift mr goldberg who studied at the new york studio school and received his mfa from queens college says he was very fortunate to have had great teachers one in particular gave him a message that meant a great deal to him and that he in turn hopes to pass along to the young artists he teaches “you’re doing fine keep going” “i always remember that” he says “that she thought i could be an artist in a true deeper sense of what that entails” mr goldberg has taught for nearly  years working at times with underprivileged students to him the greatest gift he can give is to pass on the encouragement he received “art is always up for discourse about what’s better worse—it’s never something that can be proven i think it’s natural for a young artist to be a little daunted by the immeasurability of it so i think we do need to fortify each other all the way through there are days where one might question this at its core when you’re young it’s an enormous thing to think you want to take it on” closer to silence over the years mr goldberg’s art has reflected an exploration of color particularly the tension between color’s vibrancy and his wanting it to “be quiet at the same time” “color is very forceful it has a strong disposition i just got to a point where i wanted to remove it and focus on something quieter” he says of a series of grey paintings he recently created “i’m back into color again but i’d like to think the grey paintings have made my work more intimate and a bit quieter i’m always wanting them to live closer to silence than volume it’s important to me” mr goldberg says he hopes his art “can live without words—that to be around it could be some form of a respite or quietness a positive experience but not void of intellect and sophistication it’s somewhat idealistic but i love idealism because it brings us toward something that’s better” glenn goldberg has received grants from the edward albee foundation the guggenheim fellowship and the national endowment for the arts his work is held in numerous collections including the metropolitan museum of art the national academy of arts and letters the brooklyn museum of art the national gallery of art and the museum of contemporary art in los angeles as well as in the jpmorgan chase art

in  the provisions of the glass–steagall act forced jp morgan  co to separate its investment banking from its commercial banking operations jp morgan  co chose to operate as a commercial bank because after the stock market crash of  investment banking was in some disrepute and commercial lending was perceived to be more the profitable and prestigious business additionally many within jp morgan

after being barred from securities business for over a year the heads of jp morgan made the decision to spin off its investment banking operations two jp morgan partners henry s morgan son of jack

banking  legalregulatory jp morgan ordered to pay  million to oil heiress’s trust by susanne craig october    pm october    pm james gibbardtulsa worldjudge linda g morrissey of the tulsa county district court in oklahoma  pm  updated trust accounts require advisers to be even more diligent in putting the interests of clients ahead of the banks’ this week an oklahoma judge found that jpmorgan chase had been “grossly negligent and reckless” in its administration of one client’s trust account and ordered the bank to pay  million in a harshly worded opinion released late tuesday judge linda g morrissey of the tulsa county district court in oklahoma said that the bank had breached a series of fiduciary duties in its handling of the trust of carolyn s burford an oil heiress who died in  the court also ordered jpmorgan to pay punitive damages to be set at a later date along with the trust’s legal fees judge morrissey concluded that jpmorgan had breached its fiduciary duty in  when it sold what are known as variable prepaid forward contracts to the trust a complex feerich product that the judge determined was unsuitable for the trust “we disagree with the court’s decision and will take all appropriate measures to respond including appealing the decision” jpmorgan said in a statement erin donovan a lawyer for one of the burford family members praised the ruling “i think the judge was affronted by the fact that jpmorgan which was in a position of trust betrayed it for their own benefit” this case is likely to put a spotlight on trust accounts under the current law some stockbrokers are required to act in a customer’s best interest — but that is a lessstringent standard that allows them to sell products that are suitable but not necessarily in a client’s best interest brokers who handle trust accounts are held to the higher standard and have to do what is best for the client alone the contracts in this case were pitched as a way to generate more income for the trust which was established in  by ms burford’s parents the trust now benefits ann fletcher ms burford’s daughter carolyn burford’s father founded skelly oil and her mother had ties with another oil company the trust initially contained a significant amount of exxon mobil stock jpmorgan and the trust entered into several variable prepaid forward contracts from  to  the judge found that jpmorgan which ended up with the account after a series of bank mergers had not properly explained the product to its client and had failed to disclose that the bank was benefiting from the transaction the bank also breached its duty when it invested the proceeds of the contracts in its own investment products which the judge said “amounted to double dipping” that was unreasonable “the bank provided incentives to its employees to generate revenue for the bank this created a situation in which the selfinterest of employees managing and advising fiduciary accounts was placed in conflict with the interest of those to whom the bank owed fiduciary duties” the judge wrote the misconduct in the case the judge added showed a serious disregard for customers of the bank which was aware “or recklessly failed to be aware” of the conduct at issue “the court finds that beyond simply restoring the trust in the position in which it should have been maintained it is appropriate to assess punitive damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the bank for its conduct” judge morrissey wrote correction october   an earlier version of this article misstated the jurisdiction of judge linda g morrissey she is a district judge for the tulsa county district court which is a state court in oklahoma not for the united states district court which is also in tulsa whats next loading previous post business day live
