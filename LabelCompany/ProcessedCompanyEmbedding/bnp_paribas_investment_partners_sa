march   quick take the combination of digital and quantitative research enables us to be ambitious in our “digital advice capabilities” now we write for digital first and we are introducing more and more video and infographic content we are looking at how to combine the social data we have to reach new insight on behaviours most popular marketing news  insights want more digital marketing insights inspiration and opinion sign up for our weekly newsletters to stay on top of the latest digital marketing trends and strategies—for and by marketing leaders sign up now twitter marketers were following from equity derivatives trader to longstanding member of the executive committee pierre moulin has worked for french bank bnp paribas for two decades and for the past  years within its asset management business taking up a new position created last year he is now global head of products and strategic marketing helping to steer bnp paribas investment partners through its digital transformation process and build greater intimacy with its range of clients from fund buyers institutional to endinvestors speaking to cmocom recently he talked us through the new role the evolving organisational structure and the creation of digital advice capabilities that should give the company an edge moulin my new position has four dimensions upstream there is the strategic dimension regarding product development and our capabilities this relates to making sure we understand all the opportunities that arise by analysing the market landscape including the competition and regulatory environment secondly my role includes leading the decisionmaking process around our product launches and offers the other two dimensions are complimentary operational and strategic one is the digitalisation of how we operate which includes a digital team under my remit and the other is quantitative research which is very important for us and our positioning it’s a way to be connected to the investment teams and their processes to help them come up with solutions to develop the combination of digital and quantitative research enables us to be ambitious in what we call our “digital advice capabilities” it’s where we can combine user experience digital ecosystems and therefore digital capabilities together with technologies and algorithms which helps the core business of an asset manager  my role is part of our evolution as a business the starting point is to be really global and integrated as much as possible in how we operate there was a need to have people between client and investment able to onboard strategy for the development of the company  the company also has a broader digital transformation plan which is there to prepare the organisation for new challenges in the asset management industry it covers a degree analysis of internal processes such as how we manage our product life cycle for example and reengineering these because of the potential of digital then there’s digital working and the tools we give our teams to work with on a daily basis so they can better interact with our clients that’s managed by our it and operational teams the digitalisation of how we track and interact with our clients is my responsibility cmocom what’s your approach to building more interaction with client through digital and what are the current investment priorities moulin we picture this as a pyramid where you start from the base and work up through six layers so that by the top you end up with a full interaction with clients on a basic level—and the work we started about  years ago—it is decentralising the management of websites so the organisation is more focused on channels this looks at how we provide content we used to write for “print first” but now we write for digital first and we are introducing more and more video and infographic content  some years ago we also started developing a more public approach via social media to give us more interaction with clients we took a more formalised approach to sharing our messages through social media and developed content adapted to that media for example a blog which has worked to create greater interaction with a larger audience and share our value proposition  another step is equipping our sales force to be more efficient and have all the information they need at hand while they’re moving around it’s an important change of mindset  a further step towards greater intimacy with clients is introducing digital tools for our fund buyers and distribution channels so they can build customer satisfaction some apply to institutional clients we developed websites that have the relevant information and content for their specific needs then there’s developing digital for the endclients we have many distributors who are also working on their user experience and customer journeys we help by providing them with mvps that can supplement and enhance the digital experience for example a lot of gamification so they can introduce their own clients to our financial products  the final and ultimate step which we’ve been working on for the past  to  months and is where we put most investment currently is building our digital advice service as mentioned before these are all steps we’re taking to improve the intimacy with clients  cmocom can you share any results moulin regarding our internal channels we are monitoring the number of advisors we onboard after building specific environments tools and information for all the countries we have onboarded  advisors we know they come back on a daily basis and spend more than  minutes per session—that’s a good indicator of how important those tools are in their daytoday life  in terms of social media we have built a good community of close to  followers on twitter and  followers on linkedin until now we’ve measured the breadth of followers but are increasingly looking at interaction levels with this audience in feedback so far the results are quite impressive which reflects well on the quality of information we share  regarding endclients and our subscription advisory we can’t share details at the moment but it’s somewhere we’re investing in quite significantly  cmocom what innovations have you made in building the digital advice service moulin there is a lot of innovation behind this it relates to how to combine our products and customise how we communicate these to the specific needs of the endclient the innovation is a mix of algorithm capability with a good understanding of the regulatory constraints and educational requirements so that we create an innovative user experience  another area where we try to be as innovative as possible is in the data dimension we have built a data lake recently and are looking at how to combine the social data we have to reach new insight on behaviours we are processing data that comes from the usual internal suspects—such as finance product data client—combined with external data such as social media and from unstructured social data the aim is to start to build some form of predictive aspect in how we present products to different client segments  these types of data initiatives are a source of inspiration in the business they’re a way to build new use cases for audiences such as teams in product in sales and also investment we’re also looking into new sources of unstructured data for our investment processes so not only relying on the usual financial data income statement data or price data—but combining that with an extra layer of data coming from elsewhere  cmocom where does mobile fit into digital transformation for you moulin everything we do digitally is increasingly consumed on mobile so we have to adapt our content we have to be able to build tools or apps that are multidevice by definition and therefore mix tablets smartphones and desktop  our starting point for design is more and more often the smartphone and then the second step is how to adapt this to desktop we’re launching an app in france for example for use by endclients it’s all about teaching about investing in the financial markets at the same time we want it to be an enjoyable experience so we’re doing this through community gaming we’re helping our clients to build their own portfolio—not necessarily for investing—and to compete with others through leagues and so on it’s getting a lot of traction and is something that started on mobile  cmocom the work you’ve done requires a big cultural change internally what have been the challenges moulin it’s been a significant change to put in practice and one of the reasons we’ve brought together the dimensions under my remit when it comes to digitalisation we need to have a spectrum of profiles that are sometimes at odds with each other on the one hand we need marketers who are more and more digital marketers—that’s an evolution for sure at the same time we are bringing in a new type of profiles we’re recruiting data scientists for example to crunch the large amount of data that comes from the changes we’ve made and we have recruited a significant number of employees who we call “it agile digital developers” so we can be fast and agile we’re now onboarding these new recruits and putting a lot of effort into making sure they don’t feel the heaviness of a large organisation or see it as an environment where they can’t innovate  one of the cultural changes we therefore have to manage is to create an internal startup mindset combined with the legacy of the team profile we have in the company that’s a distinct spirit we’re trying to develop  twitter marketers were following angela rumsey is a bb journalist specialising in marketing and retail related
