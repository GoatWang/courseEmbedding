david komansky by  he was ceo and chairman he was one of the first african americans to hold such a high position on wall street oneal earned  million in  and  million in  one of his first moves as ceo was to dismiss his number two executive executive vice chairman thomas h patrick sr and afterward arshad r zakaria who headed institutional banking and securities originally there had been a deal where patrick and arshad r zakaria would support oneals promotion to ceo and in return zakaria would be appointed president however once oneal became ceo he refused to continue this backroom dealing

goldman sachs at its own game after the departure of chris ricciardi oneal hired osman semerci on the advice of fixedincome head dow kim and chief administrative officer ahmass fakahany semerci continued the push into the subprime mortgagebacked cdo market and grew the firms position from  to  billion worth of exposure to  billion in under one year while firing respected trader jeff kronthal and demoting risk manager john breit both of whom had warned against too much exposure to cdos merrill was one of the top cdo underwriters of the boom era a plan that initially brought huge bonuses to merrill until the markets turned according to the thenpresident of merrill greg fleming the dismissal of kronthal in july  was the day merrill lynch’s fate was sealed otherwise the firm may have

the utter lunacy of semerci’s desire to clean house did he really think semerci could get rid of merrill’s most experienced mortgage traders and not harm the mortgage desk sadly it seems that o’neal didn’t think about it at all at the same time goldman executives were canceling vacations to deal with the burgeoning subprime crisis o’neal was often on the golf course playing round after round by himself in fact six months before bear stearns nearly collapsed merril added tens of billions of risky securities to its balance sheet while goldman moved to reduce exposure during august and
