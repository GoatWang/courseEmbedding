drugs zacks earnings esp expected surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive

physicians for current patients request an appointment call us  at   chat online now test     have questions call   to speak to a cancer information specialist advanced genomic testing every cancer like every patient is different genomic tumor assessments help identify the dna alterations that are driving the growth of a particular tumor as we understand more about these gene mutations we are better able to provide cancer treatment therapies that specifically target changes in the tumors genomic profile information about genomic changes that are unique to your individual cancer may help us determine treatments that may be appropriate for you its the promise of precision cancer treatment—a focus on the individual tumor in the individual patient since genomic testing may not be right for every patient your oncologist will help determine if you are a good candidate for the assessments evolution of care for centuries scientists have been searching for better ways to treat cancer the development of radiation therapy in the early s and chemotherapy in the s were two milestones but both had significant drawbacks early chemotherapy drugs lacked the selective capacity to distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells resulting in toxic and sometimes intolerable side effects for patients radiation therapy initially was shown to cause cancer in addition to treating it thanks to medical advances both therapies have become more targeted and researchers have found ways to minimize side effects today radiation therapy and chemotherapy are considered the standard of care in treating cancer patients helping millions of survivors to live longer the future is here but these therapies still have limitations for example two patients displaying symptoms and imaging results associated with a certain cancer might be prescribed the same chemotherapy regimen only to experience drastically different outcomes why because the root cause of their disease and the treatment needed are different as is the molecular makeup of their individual tumor the human genome project completed in  marked a dramatic shift in the understanding of cancer and other diseases after  years researchers mapped the entire human genetic code discovering that every human cell is packed with an estimated  to  genes researchers have used the discoveries to link dozens of diseases such as alzheimer’s disease and inherited colon cancer to specific genes in the case of cancer researchers have discovered that two genes brca and brca are associated with breast and ovarian cancers likewise researchers have developed a drug specifically to treat breast cancers that demonstrate an overproduction of the protein her such drugs now standard in the treatment of breast ovarian lung and some other cancers target inherited genetic abnormalities identified through genetic tests which detect mutations passed down from one generation to the next in recent years the medical world has taken the advancements one step further with genomic tests of the cancer itself these even more targeted assessments study the dna profile of the patient’s tumor searching for genetic abnormalities that can be matched to a particular drug therapy that may not have otherwise been considered “this is an incredibly powerful positive force in medical care we were in the dark ages before this” dr maurie markman president of medicine and science at cancer treatment centers of america® ctca says of advanced genomic testing “it is the tsunami on our shores and it’s going to take over all of medicine it is the future of cancer care no question about it” search all treatments advanced genomic testing infographic scientific advances have broadened our understanding of how cancer forms and grows on a molecular level this deeper knowledge has ushered in a new era—of precision cancer treatment where tailored treatments target abnormalities that may be found in each tumor’s dna profile learn more about
