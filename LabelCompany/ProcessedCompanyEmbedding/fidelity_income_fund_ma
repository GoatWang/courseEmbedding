issuing insurance company you could lose money by investing in a money market fund an investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency before investing always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk liquidity risk call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss highyieldnoninvestmentgrade bonds involve greater price volatility

products find structured productslog in required structured products from fidelity fidelity currently offers new issue structured products that are either marketlinked eg equity or currency indexes certificates of deposit which carry fdic insurance protection on the invested principal subject to fdic coverage limits  per account owner per institution or senior unsecured obligations of the issuer which are not fdicinsured how they work features  benefits risks examples types how they work as with any new issue offering prospective investors should read the prospectus which provides greater detail on the offering and its structure customers may then submit indications of interest during an order period at issuance customers typically receive an allocation amount equal to the indication of interest that was submitted however submitting an indication of interest does not guarantee an allocation if the offering is oversubscribed more securities were requested than available for purchase and you did not withdraw your order you may receive only a portion of the securities you requested or none at all further if the offering is undersubscribed the offering can be pulled investments in structured products that are fdicinsured involve the issuance of an underlying certificate of deposit which is the sole obligation of the issuing bank this underlying cd provides the fdic protection on this investment nonfdicinsured structured products have no cd issuance with these investments which are unsecured debt customers are unsecured creditors of the issuer components of fidelity’s structured products the structured products offered through fidelitycom include the following components payout profile fidelity currently offers only a pointtopoint payout profile a payout profile represents how a customers cumulative return is measured the return of the structured products available on fidelitycom is measured based on two points point a initial or starting index level which is typically the closing value of the index on the pricing date and point b final index level which is typically the closing value of the index on a date specified in the offering document the product will provide its investment return based on the following formula final index level – starting index level starting index level certain structured products impose limits on return potential in the form of a cap or may limit your participation in the upside performance of the linked index or customized basket see below participation rate the potential return to the investor depends in part on what is known as the participation rate if the participation rate of the structured product is less than  the investor will realize a return that is less than the return of the linked index or customized basket for example if the participation rate is  the investor will receive only  of any positive return on the index or basket assuming no other limits on return potential the participation rate will vary by product and factors such as index type maturity and caps affect the rate cap a cap represents a ceiling above which the investor does not participate in further upside gains of the linked index or basket in other words if the linked index or benchmark generates a return greater than the stated cap investors will not receive any returns in excess of the capped return for example if a structured product allows for  participation in an index subject to a  cap the investor cannot earn more than  on the investment even if the investment appreciates above that costs and fees placement fees structuring development and other costs will vary and may impact secondary market prices for structured products investors should consider these and any other costs and fees covered in the offering document prior to investing taxes structured products may be considered contingent payment debt instruments for federal income tax purposes this means youll usually have to pay income taxes each year on imputed annual income even though you may not receive a cash payment until maturity in addition any gain realized upon the sale of these products may be treated as ordinary income please refer to the offering document for the specific tax treatment of a structured product and consult your tax advisor for more details features  benefits market participation investors participate only in the upside performance of the underlying index principal is not at risk from negative performance of the index but is subject to issuer credit and default risk access to alternative asset classes investors gain exposure to asset classes such as currencies and commodities that might otherwise be difficult to access risks credit and default risk structured products are subject to the risk of default by the issuer therefore the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer are important considerations when assessing the ability of the issuer to meet its obligations according to the terms of the structured product in summary if the issuer defaults or declares bankruptcy the investor may lose all or some of the investment in the case of fdicinsured marketlinked cds deposit amounts exceeding applicable fdic coverage limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank other limitations on fdic coverage may apply structured products which are senior unsecured notes are not fdicinsured in the event of issuer default on a nonfdicinsured product repayment of principal would be subject to the issuers restructuring and liquidation process and is in no way guaranteed limited fdic protection for fdicinsured marketlinked cds fdic coverage generally applies to the amount of invested principal only any appreciation relating to the linked index or benchmark is not fdicinsured if you hold more than the fdicinsured limitations in deposits with the issuing bank you will not receive the benefit of fdic insurance for any balance in excess of fdic limits in this instance amounts in excess of fdicinsured limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank liquidity risk structured products are intended to be held until maturity due to a limited secondary market it may not be possible to sell a structured product prior to maturity additionally should a secondary market exist investors who need to sell a structured product prior to maturity may be subject to a significant loss market or opportunity risk the potential return on structured products is subject to market volatility and the risks associated with the linked index or basket the return of a structured product may be zero or less than what could have been earned on a traditional fixed income security derivatives risk the issuers of structured products may choose to hedge their obligations by entering into derivatives andor trading in one or more instruments such as options swaps or futures the costs associated with such hedging activity could affect the market value of a structured product or the price at which the issuer may be willing to purchase a structured product in the secondary market commodity price risk if the investment benchmark is linked to one or more commodities you may be subject to market volatility and risks relating to commodities trading in commodity futures contracts associated with an underlying commodity index is speculative and can be extremely volatile the performance of the commodity index or basket of commodities may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced commodity or commodities currency and exchange rate risk if the investment benchmark is linked to a foreign currency or currency basket you may be subject to foreign currency risks the value of foreign currencies can be highly volatile and may change based on various factors which may include changes in national debt levels and trade deficits domestic and foreign inflation rates domestic and foreign interest rates and global or regional political regulatory economic or financial events performance may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced currencies or exchange rates examples the scenarios presented below are hypothetical actual investment performance may differ in all cases return of original investment principal is subject to the credit risk of the issuer or guarantor scenario  the index rises assume return is tied to the performance of the sp ® index in this scenario the index rose  over the life of the structured product in other words it was up  between purchase date and maturity further assume an original investment of  and an  participation rate given these conditions the return to the investor would be   ×  ×  so at maturity the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal plus the  index return amount for a total of  scenario  the index falls in this scenario assume return is again tied to the performance of the sp ® index but in this case the index falls  over the life of the structured product the customer would not receive any additional returns under the participation rate instead he or she would be paid according to the principal return at maturity percentage offered by the structured product assuming it was  then regardless of how far the index fell the customer would receive a full return ie  of his or her initial invested principal at the end of the term in this example the customer invested  and would receive it back at maturity scenario  a capped return in this final scenario again assume return is tied to the performance of the sp ® index assume again that the index rose  over the life of the structured product further assume an original investment of  and an  participation rate finally assume a cap of  given these conditions the return to the investor would be the lesser of the participation amount of   ×  ×  or the cap amount of   ×  so in this scenario the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal plus the  cap index return amount for a total of  these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to predict or project the performance of any investment or security taxes inflation fees andor expenses were not taken into account if they had been deducted performance would have been lower past performance is not a guarantee of future results your performance will vary and you may have a gain or loss if you sell prior to maturity before you start you should review all of the assumptions for these hypothetical examples types type

municipal income fund portfolio manager qa january   view as pdf fund managers kevin ramundo qa an interview with coportfolio manager kevin ramundo kevin how did the fund perform for the fiscal year ending january   munis were under pressure throughout much of the past  months resulting in their lackluster return the muni market began to sell off in the fall of  in response to growing supply the selloff intensified in october and especially november due to the steep rise in interest rates after donald trump won the us presidential election and republicans maintained control of congress munis reversed course in december and continued upward in january as demand firmed and interest rates remained rangebound for the year the fund returned o roughly in line net of fees with the  return of the bloomberg barclays massachusetts  year enhanced municipal bond index and the  result of the lipper peer group average did market volatility prompt any changes in your investment strategy we certainly didnt make any wholesale changes continuing to adhere to our longterm investment principles throughout the year we based investment decisions on longerterm objectives in our opinion shareholders invest in the fund because they want attractive taxexempt income and competitive riskadjusted total returns including both price appreciation and income over time for example our multiyear effort to position the fund to benefit from advance refundings was rewarded this fiscal year with our overweighting in such securities helping performance versus the massachusetts index these refundings occurred when the issuer refinanced existing debt ahead of its first call date in order to lock in current financing rates such refinancings usually result in price gains for bondholders the bonds maturities shorten and their credit quality rises because they are backed by highquality us government securities – typically us treasuries which are widely considered the highestquality bonds available but volatile market conditions also presented us with some opportunities to make a few adjustments specifically we took advantage of the increase in yields following the november  us elections to buy bonds we believed to be undervalued q where else did you uncover value we added to our holdings in lowerrated investmentgrade bonds targeting credit tiers in which we already maintained a largerthanindex stake this positioning proved timely and was a key contributor to the funds performance versus its state index lowerquality investmentgrade securities rated a and bbb attracted heavy demand from yieldseeking investors until the election helping them to generate better price appreciation than higherquality securities in addition lowerquality investmentgrade bonds were boosted by the comparatively high level of income they generated many of our recent purchases of securities rated a and bbb occurred in the final months of  thats when lowerquality investmentgrade bonds had come under pressure – making them look attractively valued to us – as investors increasingly sought higherquality issues in the wake of growing uncertainty after the election but we didnt just invest in bonds solely because they carry higher yields rather we focused on bonds that our research indicated offered a good balance between yield and risk and had the potential to outperform the muni market over time as was the case with the arated and bbbrated securities i just described what decisions detracted from performance versus the bloomberg barclays index it hurt to hold debt issued in the us virgin islands these taxexempt bonds performed quite poorly amid downgrades of some of the islands debt to belowinvestment grade reflecting the us territorys significant economic financial and budgetary challenges we sold these bonds well before period end what is your outlook as of january looking ahead our expectations for municipal returns are modest even though valuations adjusted meaningfully in the final months of the period they could continue to be influenced by a surge in supply growing expectations for multiple interest rate hikes by the us federal reserve in  and uncertainty surrounding the fiscal and regulatory policies of the new administration while the election results clearly signal the increased likelihood for policy shifts the exact path of execution is yet to be determined furthermore some proposals could have a more muted impact than anticipated and even present buying opportunities take tax reform for example although lower tax rates could hurt municipal bond valuations we believe the empirical evidence over more than  years suggests that taxrate changes are an unreliable indicator of future muni returns instead muni valuations tend to be driven more by changes in interest rates and credit fundamentals while shortterm interest rates appear poised to rise we think muni credit fundamentals in most cases remain supportive furthermore the current reform proposals articulated by the trump administration and notable members of republican leadership do not mention the elimination of the muni tax exemption to the contrary most of these proposals contemplate the elimination of the alternative minimum tax or amt which we think could lead to outperformance for muni bonds that are subject to this tax should any of these proposals get traction later ill describe some of the other potential policy shifts were watching we continue to have a favorable view of massachusetts credit outlook the states economic growth continues to outpace the nation the governor and legislature have a good working relationship and it continues to demonstrate fiscal discipline ■ kevin ramundo on policy shifts that may affect muni bonds we think broad federal tax reform under a trump administration is likely in addition we think other potential policy changes that could affect muni valuations are possible including health care reform postelection muni hospital bonds broadly came under pressure partly due to concerns that repeal of the affordable care act aca might negatively affect credit within the sector we think the possible demise of the aca would be felt most by hospitals that serve economically challenged populations conversely we think hospitals with dominant market share and more negotiating leverage with commercial insurers are less likely to be impacted additionally we think mergers and acquisitions among hospital systems could accelerate if aca reform leads to an increase in health care costs we believe that fidelitys bottomup research process is wellpositioned to identify risks and opportunities in this evolving sector infrastructure we think infrastructure development is likely to be a policy priority for the new presidential administration even so we doubt that its prioritization will translate into a material increase in the supply of taxexempt muni bonds to the contrary we believe many state and localgovernment issuers remain cautious about borrowing even though rates remain historically low furthermore we think proposed federal subsidized solutions similar to the build america bonds taxable munis program could reduce taxexempt muni supply which could help to support bond prices key takeaways the fund returned  for the fiscal year ending january   roughly in line net of fees with the  return of the bloomberg barclays massachusetts  year enhanced municipal bond index as well as the lipper peer group average amid substantial interest rate volatility the past  months the portfolio managers continued to focus on longerterm objectives by seeking to generate attractive taxexempt income and competitive riskadjusted returns over time the funds performance versus the massachusetts index was helped by overweightings in bonds that were advance refunded during the period and lowerrated investmentgrade bonds in contrast detractors included an overweighting in taxexempt bonds issued in the us virgin islands looking ahead the management team foresees modest returns for municipal bonds on may   cormac cullen and mark sommer joined kevin ramundo as comanagers of the fund market recap for the year ending january   taxexempt bond performance was slightly negative with the bloomberg barclays municipal bond index returning  for much of the period fairly strong demand and a stable credit environment for state and local governments drove moderate muni returns but a downward trend began in september and steepened through november – the worst month for the muni market since  – as investors became concerned that presidentelect donald trumps promises to lower taxes repeal the affordable care act and increase infrastructure spending would negatively impact market valuations all fixedincome markets were hurt by investor anticipation of further increases in policy interest rates the muni market stabilized during the last two months of the period as it became clear that changes to tax health care and fiscal policies would take time to develop and implement there was little differentiation in performance among municipal sectors this period general obligation bonds overall returned  within this sector bonds issued by local municipalities slightly outperformed statebacked bonds looking ahead we expect further market volatility as the details of proposed policy changes emerge and the us federal reserve reacts to job growth and inflation trends fiscal performance summary periods ending january   cumulative annualized  month ytd  year  year
