street redwood city ca   phone    fax   ilio pet products  friendly approach keeps biz thriving friendly approach keeps biz thriving christina o’connor on february   at  am last week i gave an ilio dentals’ teeth treat to each of my best friend’s three dogs by all three of their accounts – if their rapid consumption and wagging tails were any indication – they loved the treats that was exactly the kind of reaction that ilio pet products coowners david pang and michael choy received when they debuted the product at the pet expo in  “we were throwing these things on the ground and the dogs were just inhaling it” pang says david pang left and michael choy with their ilio dentals’ teeth treat photo from david pang ilio dentals’ teeth treat formerly known as gumbone cleans dogs’ teeth and freshens their breath the spearlike shape is designed so that the dog will slow down its chewing to optimize the treat’s cleaning capabilities according to pang the treat is so tasty that the dogs were eating it too quickly plus it features natural products – including chicken and fish teeth treat also is glutenfree pang and choy who launched ilio pet products in  wanted to create a line of dental treats to address the pervasive issue of periodontal disease in dogs “most people do not brush their dogs’ teeth” pang says in addition to teeth treats ilio “dog” in hawaiian also has a line of other items like its popular puppy pads that can absorb up to a liter of liquid for pups who are being potty trained as well as adult indoor dogs ilio also has a line of treats with flavors including chicken long rice kalua pig and haupia cream ilio grew out of what was once a side job for pang who has been in the pet in dustry for more than  years he owns a chain of pet stores in taiwan and previously owned a store in honolulu where he would occasionally create his own products to sell when the puppy pads took off pang sold his local pet store to focus on ilio since then ilio has expanded to include distributors throughout the mainland asia and more but although ilio is now an international company it still maintains a very handson approach to business pang and choy both travel several times a year to meet with their distributors and manufacturers in person “i truly believe in the bellytobelly approach of business” pang says “it is a lot easier to do business with people when they know you … and it’s not just an email or phone call it’s not the easiest way to do it but i think long term that it is the right way to do things “they look at us as partners and we look at them as partners” he adds in the next few months ilio has plans to unveil a new line of products that aim to address a number of issues that dogs face the first of these will be zen bone a treat stocked with lavender valerian and kava designed to calm down hyper canines zen bone is set to be released in april in developing products ilio has what pang describes as sort of a “backwards” process while a lot of large companies may begin with a financial bottom line ilio first creates the best possible product and then determines how much it will cost to create it “if you do your job right the philosophy at the company is that the money will come” pang says “if you start with the money you are going to have a whole bunch of problems” teeth treats and other ilio products can be found at stores including longs drugs walgreens and various pet stores teeth treat had a buy one get one free deal last month which still is available in pet stores while supplies last for more

copyright   american chemical societydd email ddouroumisgreacuk jp email jpanggreacukabstractin this study molecular modeling is introduced as a novel approach for the development of pharmaceutical solid dispersions a computational model based on quantum mechanical qm calculations was used to predict the miscibility of various drugs in various polymers by predicting the binding strength between the drug and dimeric form of the polymer the drugpolymer miscibility was also estimated by using traditional approaches such as van krevelenhoftyzer and bagley solubility parameters or flory–huggins interaction parameter in comparison to the molecular modeling approach the molecular modeling studies predicted successfully the drug–polymer binding energies and the preferable site of interaction between the functional groups the drug–polymer miscibility and the physical state of bulk materials physical mixtures and solid dispersions were determined by thermal analysis dscmtdsc and xray diffraction the produced solid dispersions were analyzed by xray photoelectron spectroscopy xps which confirmed not only the exact type of the intermolecular interactions between the drug–polymer functional groups but also the binding strength by estimating the n coefficient values the findings demonstrate that qmbased molecular modeling is a powerful tool to predict the strength and type of intermolecular interactions in a range of drugpolymeric systems for the development of solid dispersionskeywords drug−polymer interactions miscibility molecular modeling quantum mechanics solid
