can take creating a body of commercial law for each type the major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually the size and scope of the business firm and its structure management and ownership broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm generally a smaller business is more flexible while larger businesses or those with wider ownership or more formal structures will usually tend to

income is taxed twice what is a professional corporation what is a corporation do i need to worry about securities laws when i issue stock in my corporation securities laws are meant to protect investors from unscrupulous business owners these laws require corporations to jump through some hoops before accepting investments in exchange for shares of stock the securities technically a corporation is required to register the sale of shares with the federal securities and exchange commission sec and its state securities agency before granting stock to the initial corporate owners shareholders registration takes time and typically involves extra legal and accounting fees fortunately many small corporations can skip the registration process because of exemptions provided by both federal and state laws for example sec rules dont require a corporation to register a private offering which is a nonadvertised sale of stock to either a limited number of people generally  or fewer or those who because of their net worth or income earning capacity can reasonably be expected to take care of themselves in the investment process most states have enacted their own versions of this popular federal exemption if you and a few associates are setting up a corporation that youll actively manage you will no doubt qualify for an exemption and you will not have to file any paperwork for more information about federal exemptions visit the sec website at wwwsecgov for more information on your states exemption rules go to your secretary of states website you can find links to each states site at the website of the national association of secretaries of state wwwnassorg what is limited liability and why is it important if a business owner has limited liability it means that he or she is not personally responsible for business debts and obligations of the corporation in other words if the corporation is sued only the assets of the business are at risk not the owners shareholders personal assets such as their houses or cars the corporations owners must comply with certain corporate formalities keep up with paperwork requirements and adequately fund capitalize their business to maintain this limited liability privilege for more information see nolos article corporation basics limited liability traditionally associated with corporations is the main reason most people consider incorporating however other business structures such as limited liability companies llcs now offer this limited personal liability to business owners sole proprietorships and general partnerships do not how are corporations different from partnerships sole proprietorships and llcs unlike corporations partnerships and sole proprietorships do not provide limited personal liability for business debts this means that creditors of those businesses can go after the owners personal assets to collect whats due however organizing and operating a partnership or sole proprietorship is much easier than forming a corporation because no formal paperwork is required a limited liability company llc on the other hand does offer limited personal liability like a corporation and while formal paperwork is required to form an llc running an llc is less complicated than running a corporation llc owners do not have to hold regular ownership and management meetings or follow other corporate formalities for example corporations also differ from other business structures in the way they are taxed the corporation itself must pay corporate income taxes on its profits  whatever is left over after paying salaries bonuses and other deductible expenses in contrast partnerships sole proprietorships and llcs are not taxed on business profits instead the profits pass through the business to the owners who report business income or losses on their personal tax returns for more on corporations see nolos article corporation basics for more on the other business

the corporation you should form a corporation only if you have good reason to do so if you merely want to limit your personal liability for business debts forming a limited liability company llc is probably smarter because llcs cost less to form and are easier to run but here are some situations in which incorporating your business instead of forming an llc might make sense your business needs the ability to issue stock or stock options to attract key employees or outside investment capital your business is so profitable that you can save significant income tax dollars by keeping some profits in the corporation each year this strategy called income splitting takes advantage of the lower tax rates on corporate income of up to  for more information see nolos article how corporations are taxed you own a family business and you want to begin making gifts of ownership to your family as part of your financial or estate plan or to plan for the next generation of owners you can easily make gifts of shares in your corporation without necessarily giving up management control and if its done correctly without paying gift tax others insist that you incorporate your business for example if you are an independent contractor companies you want to work for may ask you to incorporate before they will sign contracts for your services these companies dont want the irs or another government agency to reclassify you as an employee which is very unlikely if you are incorporated how do i form a corporation there are several steps required to legally create a corporation the first is filing a short document called articles of incorporation with the corporations division of your state government some states refer to this organizational document as a certificate of incorporation a certificate of formation or a charter youll have to pay a filing fee that ranges from about  to  depending on the rules of the state where you file this document contains basic information such as the name of your corporation the corporations address the name and address of your registered agent the person to be contacted by any member of the public who needs to speak to someone about the corporation and in some states the names of the corporations directors when forming your corporation you must also create corporate bylaws a longer document that sets out the rules that govern your corporation including decisionmaking procedures and voting rights finally before you start doing business you must hold an initial meeting of your board of directors to take care of some formalities and you need to issue shares of stock to the initial owners shareholders for more information see nolos article how to form a corporation does running a corporation involve more paperwork than running other types of businesses yes corporations must comply with statutory rules that unincorporated businesses such as limited liability companies llcs partnerships and sole proprietorships do not for instance corporations must observe corporate formalities such as holding and taking minutes of annual shareholder and director meetings and documenting important decisions also corporations must file and pay taxes on a separate corporate tax return and must set up a doubleentry bookkeeping system to record business transactions complete with daily journals and a general ledger to learn more about corporate paperwork read nolos article documenting corporate decisions how is corporate income taxed unlike sole proprietors and owners of partnerships and llcs a corporations owners do not pay individual taxes on all business profits the owners pay taxes only on profits paid out to them in the form of salaries bonuses and dividends dividends are portions of profits that large corporations sometimes pay out to shareholders in return for their investment in the company the corporation pays taxes at special corporate tax rates on any profits that are left in the company from year to year called retained earnings note that this taxation scheme does not apply to s corporations which are corporations that have elected partnershipstyle taxation regular corporations discussed above are called c corporations if your corporation elects to be taxed as an s corporation all of the corporations profits and losses will pass through to the owners who will report them on their individual income tax returns to learn more about s corporations see nolos article s corporation facts for more information on regular corporate taxation see nolos article how corporations are taxed what is double taxation does it mean that corporate income is taxed twice many people have heard that corporate income is taxed twice once to the corporation itself and then a second time when earnings are paid out to the corporations owners shareholders this is true only for earnings paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends  that is profits paid by the corporation to its shareholders in return for their investment in the company in practice this sort of double taxation seldom occurs in a small corporation the reason is simple shareholders rarely pay themselves dividends instead they work for the corporation and pay themselves salaries and bonuses because the corporation can deduct salaries and bonuses as ordinary and necessary business expenses it doesnt have to pay corporate tax on them dividends on the other hand are not a taxdeductible corporate expense so both the corporation and the shareholder must pay tax as long as you work for your corporation even in a parttime or consulting capacity you can avoid double taxation by taking home profits in the form of a salary and bonuses rather than dividends for more information see nolos article how corporations are taxed what is a professional corporation a professional corporation is a special kind of corporation that only members of certain professions such as lawyers doctors and healthcare workers can create by forming a professional corporation professionals can limit their personal liability for the malpractice of their associates for more information see nolos article professional corporations what is a corporation what sets the corporation apart from all other types of businesses is that a corporation is an independent legal entity separate from the people who own control and manage it in other words corporation and tax laws view the corporation as a legal person that can enter into contracts incur debts and pay taxes apart from its owners other important characteristics also result from the corporations separate existence a corporation does not dissolve when its owners shareholders change or die and the owners of a corporation have limited liability  that is they are not personally

references overviewedit a limited liability company llc is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship depending on how many owners there are an llc although a business entity is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation the primary characteristic an llc shares with a corporation is limited liability and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of passthrough income taxation it is often more flexible than a corporation and it is wellsuited for companies with a single owner in the absence of express statutory guidance most american courts have held that llc members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders however it is more difficult to pierce the llc veil because llcs do not have many formalities to maintain so long as the llc and the members do not commingle funds it would be difficult to pierce this veil membership interests in llcs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism the charging order limits the creditor of a debtorpartner or a debtormember to the debtors share of distributions without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rightscitation needed limited liability company members may in certain circumstances also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the llc insolvent flexibility and default rulesedit the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement or its equivalent is found throughout all existing llc statutescitation needed and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the llc have in deciding how their llc will be governed provided it does not go outside legal bounds state statutes typically provide automatic or default rules for how an llc will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise similarly the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the by laws is also found in all corporation law statutescitation needed but often refers only to a narrower range of matters the limited liability company llc has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the united states as the llcs popularity has surged unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes particularly around singlemember llcs in florida new york california colorado and georgia where personal asset protection has been subverted effective august   the delaware limited liability company

and transfer restrictions a written llc operating agreement should be signed by all of its members income taxedit for us federal income tax purposes an llc is treated by default as a passthrough entity if there is only one member in the company the llc is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes and an individual owner would report the llcs income or loss on schedule c of his or her individual tax return thus income from the llc is taxed at the individual tax rates the default tax status for llcs with multiple members is as a partnership which is required to report income and loss on irs form  under partnership tax treatment each member of the llc as is the case for all partners of a partnership annually receives a form k reporting the members distributive share of the llcs income or loss that is then reported on the members individual income tax return on the other hand income from corporations is taxed twice once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an llc rather than a corporation an llc with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of irs form  after electing corporate tax status an llc may further elect to be treated as a regular c corporation taxation of the entitys income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members or as an s corporation entity level income and loss passes through to the members some commentators have recommended an llc taxed as a scorporation as the best possible small business structure it combines the simplicity and flexibility of an llc with the tax benefits of an scorporation selfemployment tax savings advantagesedit choice of tax regime an llc can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor partnership s corporation or c corporation as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment providing for a great deal of flexibility a limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members distributive share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation  cfr  are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law the owners of the llc called members are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the llc depending on state shield laws in the united states an s corporation has a limited number of stockholders and all of them must be us citizens an llc may have an unlimited number of members and there is no citizenship restriction much less administrative paperwork and recordkeeping than a corporation passthrough taxation ie no double taxation unless the llc elects to be taxed as a c corporation using default tax classification profits are taxed personally at the member level not at the llc level llcs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members however in some jurisdictions such as connecticut case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and llc members can be personally liable for operation of the llc see for example the case of sturm v harb development llcs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved less risk of being stolen by firesale acquisitions more protection against hungry investors for real estate companies each separate property can be owned by its own individual llc thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from crossliability disadvantagesedit although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions members of a multiple member llc who operate without one may encounter problems unlike state laws regarding stock corporations which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company thus in the absence of such statutory provisions the members of an llc must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document it may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an llc as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the betterunderstood corporate form with a view toward an eventual ipo one possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it dissolving the llc and converting into a corporation many jurisdictionsâincluding alabama california kentucky new york pennsylvania tennessee and texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on llcs in essence this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the llc pays the state for the benefit of limited liability the franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue an amount based on profits or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state or some combination of those factors or simply a flat fee as in delaware effective in texas for  the franchise tax is replaced with the texas business margin tax this is paid as tax payable  revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor in most states however the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations in california both foreign and domestic llcs corporations and trusts whether forprofit or nonprofitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of  per year to the franchise tax board and no foreign llc corporation or trust may conduct business in california unless it is duly registered with the california secretary of state the district of columbia considers llcs to be taxable entities thus eliminating the benefit of passthrough taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation typically llcs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation which occurs in corporations this allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns renewal fees may also be higher maryland for example charges a stock or nonstock corporation  for the initial charter and  for an llc the fee for filing the annual report the following year is  for stockcorporations and llcs the fee is zero for nonstock corporations in addition certain states such as new york impose a publication requirement upon formation of the llc which requires that the members of the llc publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the llc will be located that it is being formed for llcs located in major metropolitan areas eg new york city the cost of publication can be significant the management structure of an llc may not be clearly stated unlike corporations they are not required to have a board of directors or officers this could also be seen as an advantage to some taxing jurisdictions outside the us are likely to treat a us llc as a corporation regardless of its treatment for us tax purposesâfor example a us llc doing business outside the us or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction this is very likely where the country such as canada does not recognize llcs as an authorized form of business entity in that country the principals of llcs use many different titlesâeg member manager managing member managing director chief executive officer president and partner as such it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the llcs behalf variationsedit a professional limited liability company pllc pllc or pl is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services usually professions where the state requires a license to provide services such as a doctor chiropractor lawyer accountant architect landscape architect or engineer require the formation of a pllc

an llc act modeled on wyomings llc act due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of llcs no other states introduced llc legislation until after  in  the irs issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a wyomingstyle llc as a partnership for tax purposes by  nearly every state had enacted an llc statute the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws adopted the uniform limited liability company act in  and revised it in  a potential disadvantage specific to the united states is that llcs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure they are instead treated as partnerships this affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving llcs barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the llc is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties should one member of an llc be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen any case between the llc and those parties must be heard in that states courts corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated most commonly delaware for large corporations which has a small population or has its principal place of business aol was set up as an llc during its ownership by

private limited company it is a business structure that combines the passthrough taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation an llc is not a corporation it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions llcs do not need to be organized for profit in certain us states for example texas businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license such as legal or medical services may not be allowed to form an llc but may be required to form a similar entity

arab emirates  united kingdom  united states  see also  references overviewedit a limited liability company llc is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship depending on how many owners there are an llc although a business entity is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation the primary characteristic an llc shares with a corporation is limited liability and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of passthrough income taxation it is often more flexible than a corporation and it is wellsuited for companies with a single owner in the absence of express statutory guidance most american courts have held that llc members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders however it is more difficult to pierce the llc veil because llcs do not have many formalities to maintain so long as the llc and the members do not commingle funds it would be difficult to pierce this veil membership interests in llcs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism the charging order limits the creditor of a debtorpartner or a debtormember to the debtors share of distributions without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rightscitation needed limited liability company members may in certain circumstances also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the llc insolvent flexibility and default rulesedit the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement or its equivalent is found throughout all existing llc statutescitation needed and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the llc have in deciding how their llc will be governed provided it does not go outside legal bounds state statutes typically provide automatic or default rules for how an llc will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise similarly the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the by laws is also found in all corporation law statutescitation needed but often refers only to a narrower range of matters the limited liability company llc has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the united states as the llcs popularity has surged unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes particularly around singlemember llcs in florida new york california colorado and georgia where personal asset protection has been subverted effective august   the delaware limited liability company act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members under the amendment prompted by the delaware supreme courts decision in gatz properties llc v auriga capital corp november  parties to an llc remain free to expand restrict or eliminate fiduciary duties in their llc agreements subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under  del c section  a delaware llc operating agreement can be written oral or implied it sets forth member capital contributions ownership percentages and management structure like a prenuptial agreement an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buyout rights valuation formulas and transfer restrictions a written llc operating agreement should be signed by all of its members income taxedit for us federal income tax purposes an llc is treated by default as a passthrough entity if there is only one member in the company the llc is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes and an individual owner would report the llcs income or loss on schedule c of his or her individual tax return thus income from the llc is taxed at the individual tax rates the default tax status for llcs with multiple members is as a partnership which is required to report income and loss on irs form  under partnership tax treatment each member of the llc as is the case for all partners of a partnership annually receives a form k reporting the members distributive share of the llcs income or loss that is then reported on the members individual income tax return on the other hand income from corporations is taxed twice once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an llc rather than a corporation an llc with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of irs form  after electing corporate tax status an llc may further elect to be treated as a regular c corporation taxation of the entitys income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members or as an s corporation entity level income and loss passes through to the members some commentators have recommended an llc taxed as a scorporation as the best possible small business structure it combines the simplicity and flexibility of an llc with the tax benefits of an scorporation selfemployment tax savings advantagesedit choice of tax regime an llc can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor partnership s corporation or c corporation as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment providing for a great deal of flexibility a limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members distributive share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation  cfr  are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law the owners of the llc called members are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the llc depending on state shield laws in the united states an s corporation has a limited number of stockholders and all of them must be us citizens an llc may have an unlimited number of members and there is no citizenship restriction much less administrative paperwork and recordkeeping than a corporation passthrough taxation ie no double taxation unless the llc elects to be taxed as a c corporation using default tax classification profits are taxed personally at the member level not at the llc level llcs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members however in some jurisdictions such as connecticut case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and llc members can be personally liable for operation of the llc see for example the case of sturm v harb development llcs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved less risk of being stolen by firesale acquisitions more protection against hungry investors for real estate companies each separate property can be owned by its own individual llc thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from crossliability disadvantagesedit although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions members of a multiple member llc who operate without one may encounter problems unlike state laws regarding stock corporations which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company thus in the absence of such statutory provisions the members of an llc must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document it may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an llc as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the betterunderstood corporate form with a view toward an eventual ipo one possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it dissolving the llc and converting into a corporation many jurisdictionsâincluding alabama california kentucky new york pennsylvania tennessee and texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on llcs in essence this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the llc pays the state for the benefit of limited liability the franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue an amount based on profits or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state or some combination of those factors or simply a flat fee as in delaware effective in texas for  the franchise tax is replaced with the texas business margin tax this is paid as tax payable  revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor in most states however the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations in california both foreign and domestic llcs corporations and trusts whether forprofit or nonprofitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of  per year to the franchise tax board and no foreign llc corporation or trust may conduct business in california unless it is duly registered with the california secretary of state the district of columbia considers llcs to be taxable entities thus eliminating the benefit of passthrough taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation typically llcs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation which occurs in corporations this allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns renewal fees may also be higher maryland for example charges a stock or nonstock corporation  for the initial charter and  for an llc the fee for filing the annual report the following year is  for stockcorporations and llcs the fee is zero for nonstock corporations in addition certain states such as new york impose a publication requirement upon formation of the llc which requires that the members of the llc publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the llc will be located that it is being formed for llcs located in major metropolitan areas eg new york city the cost of publication can be significant the management structure of an llc may not be clearly stated unlike corporations they are not required to have a board of directors or officers this could also be seen as an advantage to some taxing jurisdictions outside the us are likely to treat a us llc as a corporation regardless of its treatment for us tax purposesâfor example a us llc doing business outside the us or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction this is very likely where the country such as canada does not recognize llcs as an authorized form of business entity in that country the principals of llcs use many different titlesâeg member manager managing member managing director chief executive officer president and partner as such it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the llcs behalf variationsedit a professional limited liability company pllc pllc or pl is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services usually professions where the state requires a license to provide services such as a doctor chiropractor lawyer accountant architect landscape architect or engineer require the formation of a pllc however some states such as california do not permit llcs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession exact requirements of pllcs vary from state to state typically a pllcs members must all be professionals practicing the same profession in addition the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims a series llc is a special form of a limited liability company that allows a single llc to segregate its assets into separate series for example a series llc that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property the others are not affected an lc is a forprofit social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose not maximizing income it is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional llc the social benefits of a nonprofit organization and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise an anonymous limited liability company is a llc where ownership information is not made publicly available by the state where the llc is registered this is done by using a thirdparty to act as the organizer and registered agent of the llc level of anonymity varies with different states international equivalentsedit it has been

structure authorized by state statutes the llc is chiefly inspired by the gmbh company with limited liability a type of business organization in germany and by the limitada a type of business

internal revenue service issued a private letter ruling to an llc formed under the wyoming llc act indicating that the irs would treat the llc as a partnership for federal tax purposes however later that year the irs proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entitys liabilities in  florida adopted an llc act modeled on wyomings llc act due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of llcs no other states introduced llc legislation until after  in  the irs issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a wyomingstyle llc as a partnership for tax purposes by  nearly every state had enacted an llc statute the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws adopted the uniform limited liability company act in  and revised it in  a potential disadvantage specific to the united states is that llcs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure they are instead treated as partnerships this affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving llcs barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the llc is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties should one member of an llc be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen any case between the llc and those parties must be heard in that states courts corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in

arab emirates  united kingdom  united states  see also  references overviewedit a limited liability company llc is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship depending on how many owners there are an llc although a business entity is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation the primary characteristic an llc shares with a corporation is limited liability and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of passthrough income taxation it is often more flexible than a corporation and it is wellsuited for companies with a single owner in the absence of express statutory guidance most american courts have held that llc members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders however it is more difficult to pierce the llc veil because llcs do not have many formalities to maintain so long as the llc and the members do not commingle funds it would be difficult to pierce this veil membership interests in llcs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism the charging order limits the creditor of a debtorpartner or a debtormember to the debtors share of distributions without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rightscitation needed limited liability company members may in certain circumstances also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the llc insolvent flexibility and default rulesedit the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement or its equivalent is found throughout all existing llc statutescitation needed and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the llc have in deciding how their llc will be governed provided it does not go outside legal bounds state statutes typically provide automatic or default rules for how an llc will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise similarly the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the by laws is also found in all corporation law statutescitation needed but often refers only to a narrower range of matters the limited liability company llc has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the united states as the llcs popularity has surged unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes particularly around singlemember llcs in florida new york california colorado and georgia where personal asset protection has been subverted effective august   the delaware limited liability company act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members under the amendment prompted by the delaware supreme courts decision in gatz properties llc v auriga capital corp november  parties to an llc remain free to expand restrict or eliminate fiduciary duties in their llc agreements subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under  del c section  a delaware llc operating agreement can be written oral or implied it sets forth member capital contributions ownership percentages and management structure like a prenuptial agreement an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buyout rights valuation formulas and transfer restrictions a written llc operating agreement should be signed by all of its members income taxedit for us federal income tax purposes an llc is treated by default as a passthrough entity if there is only one member in the company the llc is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes and an individual owner would report the llcs income or loss on schedule c of his or her individual tax return thus income from the llc is taxed at the individual tax rates the default tax status for llcs with multiple members is as a partnership which is required to report income and loss on irs form  under partnership tax treatment each member of the llc as is the case for all partners of a partnership annually receives a form k reporting the members distributive share of the llcs income or loss that is then reported on the members individual income tax return on the other hand income from corporations is taxed twice once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an llc rather than a corporation an llc with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of irs form  after electing corporate tax status an llc may further elect to be treated as a regular c corporation taxation of the entitys income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members or as an s corporation entity level income and loss passes through to the members some commentators have recommended an llc taxed as a scorporation as the best possible small business structure it combines the simplicity and flexibility of an llc with the tax benefits of an scorporation selfemployment tax savings advantagesedit choice of tax regime an llc can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor partnership s corporation or c corporation as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment providing for a great deal of flexibility a limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members distributive share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation  cfr  are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law the owners of the llc called members are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the llc depending on state shield laws in the united states an s corporation has a limited number of stockholders and all of them must be us citizens an llc may have an unlimited number of members and there is no citizenship restriction much less administrative paperwork and recordkeeping than a corporation passthrough taxation ie no double taxation unless the llc elects to be taxed as a c corporation using default tax classification profits are taxed personally at the member level not at the llc level llcs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members however in some jurisdictions such as connecticut case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and llc members can be personally liable for operation of the llc see for example the case of sturm v harb development llcs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved less risk of being stolen by firesale acquisitions more protection against hungry investors for real estate companies each separate property can be owned by its own individual llc thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from crossliability disadvantagesedit although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions members of a multiple member llc who operate without one may encounter problems unlike state laws regarding stock corporations which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company thus in the absence of such statutory provisions the members of an llc must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document it may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an llc as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the betterunderstood corporate form with a view toward an eventual ipo one possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it dissolving the llc and converting into a corporation many jurisdictionsâincluding alabama california kentucky new york pennsylvania tennessee and texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on llcs in essence this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the llc pays the state for the benefit of limited liability the franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue an amount based on profits or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state or some combination of those factors or simply a flat fee as in delaware effective in texas for  the franchise tax is replaced with the texas business margin tax this is paid as tax payable  revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor in most states however the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations in california both foreign and domestic llcs corporations and trusts whether forprofit or nonprofitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of  per year to the franchise tax board and no foreign llc corporation or trust may conduct business in california unless it is duly registered with the california secretary of state the district of columbia considers llcs to be taxable entities thus eliminating the benefit of passthrough taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation typically llcs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation which occurs in corporations this allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns renewal fees may also be higher maryland for example charges a stock or nonstock corporation  for the initial charter and  for an llc the fee for filing the annual report the following year is  for stockcorporations and llcs the fee is zero for nonstock corporations in addition certain states such as new york impose a publication requirement upon formation of the llc which requires that the members of the llc publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the llc will be located that it is being formed for llcs located in major metropolitan areas eg new york city the cost of publication can be significant the management structure of an llc may not be clearly stated unlike corporations they are not required to have a board of directors or officers this could also be seen as an advantage to some taxing jurisdictions outside the us are likely to treat a us llc as a corporation regardless of its treatment for us tax purposesâfor example a us llc doing business outside the us or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction this is very likely where the country such as canada does not recognize llcs as an authorized form of business entity in that country the principals of llcs use many different titlesâeg member manager managing member managing director chief executive officer president and partner as such it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the llcs behalf variationsedit a professional limited liability company pllc pllc or pl is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of

would treat a wyomingstyle llc as a partnership for tax purposes by  nearly every state had enacted an llc statute the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws adopted the uniform

procedure they are instead treated as partnerships this affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving llcs barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the llc is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties should one member of an llc be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen any case between the llc

private limited company it is a business structure that combines the passthrough taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation an llc is not a corporation it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions llcs do not need to be organized for profit in certain us states for example texas businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license such as legal or medical services may not be allowed to form an llc but may be required to form a similar entity

arab emirates  united kingdom  united states  see also  references overviewedit a limited liability company llc is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship depending on how many owners there are an llc although a business entity is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation the primary characteristic an llc shares with a corporation is limited liability and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of passthrough income taxation it is often more flexible than a corporation and it is wellsuited for companies with a single owner in the absence of express statutory guidance most american courts have held that llc members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders however it is more difficult to pierce the llc veil because llcs do not have many formalities to maintain so long as the llc and the members do not commingle funds it would be difficult to pierce this veil membership interests in llcs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism the charging order limits the creditor of a debtorpartner or a debtormember to the debtors share of distributions without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rightscitation needed limited liability company members may in certain circumstances also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the llc insolvent flexibility and default rulesedit the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement or its equivalent is found throughout all existing llc statutescitation needed and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the llc have in deciding how their llc will be governed provided it does not go outside legal bounds state statutes typically provide automatic or default rules for how an llc will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise similarly the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the by laws is also found in all corporation law statutescitation needed but often refers only to a narrower range of matters the limited liability company llc has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the united states as the llcs popularity has surged unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes particularly around singlemember llcs in florida new york california colorado and georgia where personal asset protection has been subverted effective august   the delaware limited liability company act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members under the amendment prompted by the delaware supreme courts decision in gatz properties llc v auriga capital corp november  parties to an llc remain free to expand restrict or eliminate fiduciary duties in their llc agreements subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under  del c section  a delaware llc operating agreement can be written oral or implied it sets forth member capital contributions ownership percentages and management structure like a prenuptial agreement an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buyout rights valuation formulas and transfer restrictions a written llc operating agreement should be signed by all of its members income taxedit for us federal income tax purposes an llc is treated by default as a passthrough entity if there is only one member in the company the llc is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes and an individual owner would report the llcs income or loss on schedule c of his or her individual tax return thus income from the llc is taxed at the individual tax rates the default tax status for llcs with multiple members is as a partnership which is required to report income and loss on irs form  under partnership tax treatment each member of the llc as is the case for all partners of a partnership annually receives a form k reporting the members distributive share of the llcs income or loss that is then reported on the members individual income tax return on the other hand income from corporations is taxed twice once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an llc rather than a corporation an llc with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of irs form  after electing corporate tax status an llc may further elect to be treated as a regular c corporation taxation of the entitys income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members or as an s corporation entity level income and loss passes through to the members some commentators have recommended an llc taxed as a scorporation as the best possible small business structure it combines the simplicity and flexibility of an llc with the tax benefits of an scorporation selfemployment tax savings advantagesedit choice of tax regime an llc can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor partnership s corporation or c corporation as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment providing for a great deal of flexibility a limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members distributive share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation  cfr  are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law the owners of the llc called members are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the llc depending on state shield laws in the united states an s corporation has a limited number of stockholders and all of them must be us citizens an llc may have an unlimited number of members and there is no citizenship restriction much less administrative paperwork and recordkeeping than a corporation passthrough taxation ie no double taxation unless the llc elects to be taxed as a c corporation using default tax classification profits are taxed personally at the member level not at the llc level llcs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members however in some jurisdictions such as connecticut case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and llc members can be personally liable for operation of the llc see for example the case of sturm v harb development llcs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved less risk of being stolen by firesale acquisitions more protection against hungry investors for real estate companies each separate property can be owned by its own individual llc thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from crossliability disadvantagesedit although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions members of a multiple member llc who operate without one may encounter problems unlike state laws regarding stock corporations which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company thus in the absence of such statutory provisions the members of an llc must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document it may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an llc as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the betterunderstood corporate form with a view toward an eventual ipo one possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it dissolving the llc and converting into a corporation many jurisdictionsâincluding alabama california kentucky new york pennsylvania tennessee and texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on llcs in essence this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the llc pays the state for the benefit of limited liability the franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue an amount based on profits or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state or some combination of those factors or simply a flat fee as in delaware effective in texas for  the franchise tax is replaced with the texas business margin tax this is paid as tax payable  revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor in most states however the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations in california both foreign and domestic llcs corporations and trusts whether forprofit or nonprofitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of  per year to the franchise tax board and no foreign llc corporation or trust may conduct business in california unless it is duly registered with the california secretary of state the district of columbia considers llcs to be taxable entities thus eliminating the benefit of passthrough taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation typically llcs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation which occurs in corporations this allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns renewal fees may also be higher maryland for example charges a stock or nonstock corporation  for the initial charter and  for an llc the fee for filing the annual report the following year is  for stockcorporations and llcs the fee is zero for nonstock corporations in addition certain states such as new york impose a publication requirement upon formation of the llc which requires that the members of the llc publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the llc will be located that it is being formed for llcs located in major metropolitan areas eg new york city the cost of publication can be significant the management structure of an llc may not be clearly stated unlike corporations they are not required to have a board of directors or officers this could also be seen as an advantage to some taxing jurisdictions outside the us are likely to treat a us llc as a corporation regardless of its treatment for us tax purposesâfor example a us llc doing business outside the us or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction this is very likely where the country such as canada does not recognize llcs as an authorized form of business entity in that country the principals of llcs use many different titlesâeg member manager managing member managing director chief executive officer president and partner as such it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the llcs behalf variationsedit a professional limited liability company pllc pllc or pl is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services usually professions where the state requires a license to provide services such as a doctor chiropractor lawyer accountant architect landscape architect or engineer require the formation of a pllc however some states such as california do not permit llcs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession exact requirements of pllcs vary from state to state typically a pllcs members must all be professionals practicing the same profession in addition the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims a series llc is a special form of a limited liability company that allows a single llc to segregate its assets into separate series for example a series llc that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property the others are not affected an lc is a forprofit social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose not maximizing income it is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional llc the social benefits of a nonprofit organization and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise an anonymous limited liability company is a llc where ownership information is not made publicly available by the state where the llc is registered this is done by using a thirdparty to act as the organizer and registered agent of the llc level of anonymity varies with different states international equivalentsedit it has been suggested that this section be merged into private limited company discuss proposed since december  companies with limited liability exist in business law worldwide however the limited liability

structure authorized by state statutes the llc is chiefly inspired by the gmbh company with limited liability a type of business organization in germany and by the limitada a type of business organization available in many latin american countries in the united states the first limited liability company act appeared in wyoming in  as special interest legislation for an oil company in  the internal revenue service issued a private letter ruling to an llc formed under the wyoming llc act indicating that the irs would treat the llc as a partnership for federal tax purposes however later that year the irs proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entitys liabilities in  florida adopted an llc act modeled on wyomings llc act due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of llcs no other states introduced llc legislation until after  in  the irs issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a wyomingstyle llc as a partnership for tax purposes by  nearly every state had enacted an llc statute the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws adopted the uniform limited liability company act in  and revised it in  a potential disadvantage specific to the united states is that llcs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure they are instead treated as partnerships this affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving llcs barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the llc is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties should one member of an llc be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen any case between the llc and those parties must be heard in that states courts corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in

private limited company it is a business structure that combines the passthrough taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation an llc is not a

arab emirates  united kingdom  united states  see also  references overviewedit a limited liability company llc is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship depending on how many owners there are an llc although a business entity is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation the primary characteristic an llc shares with a corporation is limited liability and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of passthrough income taxation it is often more flexible than a corporation and it is wellsuited for companies with a single owner in the absence of express statutory guidance most american courts have held that llc members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders however it is more difficult to pierce the llc veil because llcs do not have many formalities to maintain so long as the llc and the members do not commingle funds it would be difficult to pierce this veil membership interests in llcs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism the charging order limits the creditor of a debtorpartner or a debtormember to the debtors share of distributions without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rightscitation needed limited liability company members may in certain circumstances also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the llc insolvent flexibility and default rulesedit the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement or its equivalent is found throughout all existing llc statutescitation needed and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the llc have in deciding how their llc will be governed provided it does not go outside legal bounds state statutes typically provide automatic or default rules for how an llc will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise similarly the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the by laws is also found in all corporation law statutescitation needed but often refers only to a narrower range of matters the limited liability company llc has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the united states as the llcs popularity has surged unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes particularly around singlemember llcs in florida new york california colorado and georgia where personal asset protection has been subverted effective august   the delaware limited liability company act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members under the amendment prompted by the delaware supreme courts decision in gatz properties llc v auriga capital corp november  parties to an llc remain free to expand restrict or eliminate fiduciary duties in their llc agreements subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under  del c section  a delaware llc operating agreement can be written oral or implied it sets forth member capital contributions ownership percentages and management structure like a prenuptial agreement an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buyout rights valuation formulas and transfer restrictions a written llc operating agreement should be signed by all of its members income taxedit for us federal income tax purposes an llc is treated by default as a passthrough entity if there is only one member in the company the llc is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes and an individual owner would report the llcs income or loss on schedule c of his or her individual tax return thus income from the llc is taxed at the individual tax rates the default tax status for llcs with multiple members is as a partnership which is required to report income and loss on irs form  under partnership tax treatment each member of the llc as is the case for all partners of a partnership annually receives a form k reporting the members distributive share of the llcs income or loss that is then reported on the members individual income tax return on the other hand income from corporations is taxed twice once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an llc rather than a corporation an llc with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of irs form  after electing corporate tax status an llc may further elect to be treated as a regular c corporation taxation of the entitys income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members or as an s corporation entity level income and loss passes through to the members some commentators have recommended an llc taxed as a scorporation as the best possible small business structure it combines the simplicity and flexibility of an llc with the tax benefits of an scorporation selfemployment tax savings advantagesedit choice of tax regime an llc can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor partnership s corporation or c corporation as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment providing for a great deal of flexibility a limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members distributive share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation  cfr  are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law the owners of the llc called members are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the llc depending on state shield laws in the united states an s corporation has a limited number of stockholders and all of them must be us citizens an llc may have an unlimited number of members and there is no citizenship restriction much less administrative paperwork and recordkeeping than a corporation passthrough taxation ie no double taxation unless the llc elects to be taxed as a c corporation using default tax classification profits are taxed personally at the member level not at the llc level llcs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members however in some jurisdictions such as connecticut case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and llc members can be personally liable for operation of the llc see for example the case of sturm v harb development llcs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved less risk of being stolen by firesale acquisitions more protection against hungry investors for real estate companies each separate property can be owned by its own individual llc thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from crossliability disadvantagesedit although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions members of a multiple member llc who operate without one may encounter problems unlike state laws regarding stock corporations which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company thus in the absence of such statutory provisions the members of an llc must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document it may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an llc as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the betterunderstood corporate form with a view toward an eventual ipo one possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it dissolving the llc and converting into a corporation many jurisdictionsâincluding alabama california kentucky new york pennsylvania tennessee and texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on llcs in essence this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the llc pays the state for the benefit of limited liability the franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue an amount based on profits or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state or some combination of those factors or simply a flat fee as in delaware effective in texas for  the franchise tax is replaced with the texas business margin tax this is paid as tax payable  revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor in most states however the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations in california both foreign and domestic llcs corporations and trusts whether forprofit or nonprofitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of  per year to the franchise tax board and no foreign llc corporation or trust may conduct business in california unless it is duly registered with the california secretary of state the district of columbia considers llcs to be taxable entities thus eliminating the benefit of passthrough taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation typically llcs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation which occurs in corporations this allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns renewal fees may also be higher maryland for example charges a stock or nonstock corporation  for the initial charter and  for an llc the fee for filing the annual report the following year is  for stockcorporations and llcs the fee is zero for nonstock corporations in addition certain states such as new york impose a publication requirement upon formation of the llc which requires that the

private limited company it is a business structure that combines the passthrough taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation an llc is not a corporation it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions llcs do not need to be organized for profit in certain us states for example texas

arab emirates  united kingdom  united states  see also  references overviewedit a limited liability company llc is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship depending on how many owners there are an llc although a business entity is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation the primary characteristic an llc shares with a corporation is limited liability and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of passthrough income taxation it is often more flexible than a corporation and it is wellsuited for companies with a single owner in the absence of express statutory guidance most american courts have held that llc members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders however it is more difficult to pierce the llc veil because llcs do not have many formalities to maintain so long as the llc and the members do not commingle funds it would be difficult to pierce this veil membership interests in llcs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism the charging order limits the creditor of a debtorpartner or a debtormember to the debtors share of distributions without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rightscitation needed limited liability company members may in certain circumstances also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the llc insolvent flexibility and default rulesedit the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement or its equivalent is found throughout all existing llc statutescitation needed and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the llc have in deciding how their llc will be governed provided it does not go outside legal bounds state statutes typically provide automatic or default rules for how an llc will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise similarly the phrase unless otherwise provided for in the by laws is also found in all corporation law statutescitation needed but often refers only to a narrower range of matters the limited liability company llc has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the united states as the llcs popularity has surged unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes particularly around singlemember llcs in florida new york california colorado and georgia where personal asset protection has been subverted effective august   the delaware limited liability company act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members under the amendment prompted by the delaware supreme courts decision in gatz properties llc v auriga capital corp november  parties to an llc remain free to expand restrict or eliminate fiduciary duties in their llc agreements subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under  del c section  a delaware llc operating agreement can be written oral or implied it sets forth member capital contributions ownership percentages and management structure like a prenuptial agreement an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buyout rights valuation formulas and transfer restrictions a written llc operating agreement should be signed by all of its members income taxedit for us federal income tax purposes an llc is treated by default as a passthrough entity if there is only one member in the company the llc is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes and an individual owner would report the llcs income or loss on schedule c of his or her individual tax return thus income from the llc is taxed at the individual tax rates the default tax status for llcs with multiple members is as a partnership which is required to report income and loss on irs form  under partnership tax treatment each member of the llc as is the case for all partners of a partnership annually receives a form k reporting the members distributive share of the llcs income or loss that is then reported on the members individual income tax return on the other hand income from corporations is taxed twice once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an llc rather than a corporation an llc with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of irs form  after electing corporate tax status an llc may further elect to be treated as a regular c corporation taxation of the entitys income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members or as an s corporation entity level income and loss passes through to the members some commentators have recommended an llc taxed as a scorporation as the best possible small business structure it combines the simplicity and flexibility of an llc with the tax benefits of an scorporation selfemployment tax savings advantagesedit choice of tax regime an llc can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor partnership s corporation or c corporation as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment providing for a great deal of flexibility a limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members distributive share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation  cfr  are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law the owners of the llc called members are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the llc depending on state shield laws in the united states an s corporation has a limited number of stockholders and all of them must be us citizens an llc may have an unlimited number of members and there is no citizenship restriction much less administrative paperwork and recordkeeping than a corporation passthrough taxation ie no double taxation unless the llc elects to be taxed as a c corporation using default tax classification profits are taxed personally at the member level not at the llc level llcs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members however in some jurisdictions such as connecticut case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and llc members can be personally liable for operation of the llc see for example the case of sturm v harb development llcs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved less risk of being stolen by firesale acquisitions more protection against hungry investors for real estate companies each separate property can be owned by its own individual llc thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from crossliability disadvantagesedit although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions members of a multiple member llc who operate without one may encounter problems unlike state laws regarding stock corporations which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company thus in the absence of such statutory provisions the members of an llc must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document it may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an llc as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the betterunderstood corporate form with a view toward an eventual ipo one possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it dissolving the llc and converting into a corporation many jurisdictionsâincluding alabama california kentucky new york pennsylvania tennessee and texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on llcs in essence this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the llc pays the state for the benefit of limited liability the franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue an amount based on profits or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state or some combination of those factors or simply a flat fee as in delaware effective in texas for  the franchise tax is replaced with the texas business margin tax this is paid as tax payable  revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor in most states however the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations in california both foreign and domestic llcs corporations and trusts whether forprofit or nonprofitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of  per year to the franchise tax board and no foreign llc corporation or trust may conduct business in california unless it is duly registered with the california secretary of state the district of columbia considers llcs to be taxable entities thus eliminating the benefit of passthrough taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation typically llcs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation which occurs in corporations this allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns renewal fees may also be higher maryland for example charges a stock or nonstock corporation  for the initial charter and  for an llc the fee for filing the annual report the following year is  for stockcorporations and llcs the fee is zero for nonstock corporations in addition certain states such as new york impose a publication requirement upon formation of the llc which requires that the members of the llc publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the llc will be located that it is being formed for llcs located in major metropolitan areas eg new york city the cost of publication can be significant the management structure of an llc may not be clearly stated unlike corporations they are not required to have a board of directors or officers this could also be seen as an advantage to some taxing jurisdictions outside the us are likely to treat a us llc as a corporation regardless of its treatment for us tax purposesâfor example a us llc doing business outside the us or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction this is very likely where the country such as canada does not recognize llcs as an authorized form of business entity in that country the principals of llcs use many different titlesâeg member manager managing member managing director chief executive officer president and partner as such it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the llcs behalf variationsedit a professional limited liability company pllc pllc or pl is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services usually professions where the state requires a license to provide services such as a doctor chiropractor lawyer accountant architect landscape architect or engineer require the formation of a pllc however some states such as california do not permit llcs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession exact requirements of pllcs vary from state to state typically a pllcs members must all be professionals practicing the same profession in addition the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims a series llc is a special form of a limited liability company that allows a single llc to segregate its assets into separate series for example a series llc that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property the others are not affected an lc is a forprofit social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose not maximizing income it is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional llc the social benefits of a nonprofit organization and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise an anonymous limited liability company is a llc where ownership information is not made publicly available by the state where the llc is registered this is done by using a thirdparty to act as the organizer and registered agent of the llc level of anonymity varies with different states international equivalentsedit it has been

subject to united kingdom corporation tax if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members united statesedit a limited liability company llc is a relatively new business structure authorized by state statutes the llc is chiefly inspired by the gmbh company with limited liability a type of business organization in germany and by the limitada a type of business organization available in many latin american countries in the united states the first limited liability company act appeared in wyoming in  as special interest legislation for an oil company in  the internal revenue service issued a private letter ruling to an llc formed under the wyoming llc act indicating that the irs would treat the llc as a partnership for federal tax purposes however later that year the irs proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entitys liabilities in  florida adopted an llc act modeled on wyomings llc act due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of llcs no other states introduced llc legislation until after  in  the irs issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a wyomingstyle llc as a partnership for tax purposes by  nearly every state had enacted an llc statute the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws adopted the uniform limited liability company act in  and revised it in  a potential disadvantage specific to the united states is that llcs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure they are instead treated as partnerships this affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving llcs barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the llc is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties should one member of an llc be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen any case between the llc and those parties must be heard in that states courts corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in

you an insurance agent or carrier Â Â  are you an insurance agent or carrier call to start your quote  please enter a valid zip code findagents better insurance starts here start a quote llc insurance home  small business insurance  coverage types  llc insurance how to find llc insurance one of the key reasons for starting a limited liability company llc is to separate your personal liability from your business operations as a business owner you want your personal assets to be protected in case your business is taken to the mat with a liability insurance claim or worse â a lawsuit itâs essential that you find the right llc insurance to protect your business against coverage gaps a trusted choiceÂ® member agent can help you find llc insurance coverage that meets your needs local member agents are familiar with your state regulations and llc insurance requirements and will work with you to tailor a policy that meets your business needs for professional assistance contact a trusted choice member agent today limited liability exceptions you can be held responsible liable for things you do while performing work for your limited liability company for example your llc will most likely not protect you if you personally injure someone you personally guarantee a business loan or debt you donât manage your business taxes correctly you intentionally commit a crime or engage in fraudulent or reckless behavior that damages the company rather than treating your company as a separate business entity you mix business and personal accounts or expenses does a limited liability company act as llc insurance starting an llc does not protect you from all threats for example a fire can break out and can damage equipment and other business property this means that while an llc designation can provide important protection it does not act as insurance it is also important to understand a concept called piercing the corporate veil you can think of an llc as a kind of barrier between your business operations and your personal finances however certain errors you make can allow the legal system to break through that barrier for example if a limited liability company takes on excessive business debt a legal team can sometimes hold the business owners accountable for those debts consulting in depth with both your independent agent and your attorney about your personal risks with regard to your llc activities is wise and can help to ensure both you and your business are protected llc insurance requirements vary by state llc insurance requirements are set by the state government so make sure youâre complying with state business insurance laws when you begin operation your required coverage may include workers compensation all states require this coverage regardless of whether the business is a limited liability company but the specific requirements vary by state some states require workers compensation whether or not a company hires staff members and some require it if the business has a certain number of employees such as three or more disability insurance some states require businesses to contribute to disability insurance whereas workers compensation covers workrelated injuries and illnesses disability insurance covers nonworkrelated incidents and illness that prevent a worker from returning to work unemployment insurance tax check with your state to determine if this tax is required it is designed to help cover the costs of unemployment insurance for workers who lose their jobs you may need to register your company with the state workforce agency as well property insurance coverage for llcs property insurance is one of the critical forms of business insurance that all companies operating from a business site should purchase this coverage protects your business property from damage or loss due to a covered cause such as fire a good commercial property policy will include coverage a variety of things ranging from the structure of your building to your personal property stored at the business site be sure to examine your policy closely for any exclusions this type of insurance is typically offered in three forms basic similar to your homeowner policy this will cover a list of perils including fire certain natural disasters and vandalism however it may not cover theft broad this expands the list of perils so that you have added coverage special form instead of naming the things that are covered this policy provides the most protection and only lists perils that arenât covered note that flooding is rarely covered by a commercial property policy liability insurance for llcs although there are many forms of commercial liability insurance not all will protect you or your business if youâre held responsible for certain errors be sure to talk with a knowledgeable independent agent who can help assess your risks and choose the appropriate coverage for your commercial operation just how extensive your liability needs are depend on the type of business you operate and the risks you face there are a few different liability insurance options for llcs general liability if a customer is injured while on your property or youâre accused of slander this policy will help take care of medical expenses legal defense costs and judgementssettlements setting the right coverage limit will be the key to protecting your llc product liability if youâre active in any step of product manufacturing or product sales you need this coverage you can be held liable if the product causes injury or property damage professional liability also known as errors and omissions insurance or e  o this is best for llcs that provide professional services for example a doctor will need a form of professional liability known as malpractice insurance which is specialized for the medical field while an investment firm needs e  o coverage for advice provided to clients that can potentially result in a financial loss directors and officers liability also called d  o this liability coverage protects your company in the event that legal action is brought against one or more of your directors or officers due to accusations of negligence or wrongdoing of course there are many other forms of llc insurance coverage that you may need if you have a fleet of vehicles for example you will need to purchase commercial vehicle insurance that covers all employee drivers vehicle damage and your companys liability in the event that you or a staff member is at fault for an accident additionally you may also want to invest in business interruption insurance which can help cover the expenses it takes to keep running your business if youâre displaced due to a building fire or natural disaster how much does llc insurance cost costs for the insurance package you need to protect your company will vary widely based on factors such as the type of business you run and the specific types of coverages you need additionally your specific llc insurance costs will depend on how many employees you have and whether you work in a litigationprone industry for this reason its a good idea to compare llc insurance quotes based on your unique business and risks whereas a small business with few risks may only need to pay a few hundred dollars per year for adequate protection a larger corporation can easily require protection in excess of  annually to get accurate llc insurance quotes that are tailored to your business risks work with an independent agent in the trusted choice network who can fully assess your needs and find the right coverage at an affordable rate protecting your llc trusted choice member agents who specialize in commercial coverage can work with
