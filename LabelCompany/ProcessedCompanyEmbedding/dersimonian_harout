dersimonian will direct and manage the cell biology materials science and other scientific research that forms the basis of biostages cellframe™ technology platform dr dersimonian has over  years of experience in developing immunotherapy and cell therapy programs and was instrumental in directing the science that enabled the first fdaapproved clinical trial using autologous human stem cells for cardiac repair throughout his career he has played a critical senior role in designing and implementing therapeutic programs at leading global institutions  dr dersimonian is a former assistant professor and postdoctoral fellow at harvard medical school and completed his postdoctoral training at the danafaber cancer institute and brigham and womens hospital dr dersimonian holds a phd in immunology from tufts university and a ba in biology from hartwick college biostage ceo jim mcgorry commented the complexity of what we are doing combined with the number of potential applications of our technology necessitate that biostage augment the leadership and management of our scientific research harout has the necessary cellular and molecular technology expertise along with an impressive record of achievement in cell therapy programs to support our path to commercialization for our cellframe technology dr dersimonian will be responsible for leading our scientific efforts and supporting the translation of our laboratory preclinical research findings for our cellspan™ esophageal implant to advance the preparation of our ind for submission with the fda he is a proven translational research scientist and we believe a very important addition to our team dr dersimonian stated i am excited to contribute to the advancement of biostages groundbreaking cellframe technology already the company has demonstrated outstanding progress in preclinical research in regenerative medicine that provides an exciting window on an array of potential medical solutions and scientific pathways about biostage inc wwwbiostagecom  biostage is a biotechnology company developing bioengineered organ implants utilizing the companys new cellframe™ technology which combines a proprietary biocompatible scaffold with a patients own stem cells to create cellspan™ organ implants cellspan implants are being developed to treat lifethreatening conditions of the esophagus bronchus and trachea with the hope of dramatically improving the treatment paradigm for patients based on its preclinical data biostage has selected lifethreatening conditions of the esophagus as the initial clinical application of its technology cellspan implants are currently being advanced and tested in preclinical studies this testing is intended to expand the base of preclinical data in support of biostages goal of filing an investigational new drug ind application with the us fda in late  the ind will seek approval to initiate clinical trials for its esophageal implants in humans
