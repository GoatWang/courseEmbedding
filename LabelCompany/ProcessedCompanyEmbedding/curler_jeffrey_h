c  the postcrescent appleton wis jeff curler never worked directly for his late father during nearly four decades with bemis co and makes no apologies for following in his footsteps i was  years behind my father in everything said curler  who retired this month as executive chairman of the global flexible packaging firm he was  years older than me born  versus  he graduated from chemical engineering school at wisconsin  years before i did  vs 7 ive been kind of following him for a long time the late howard curler who cofounded new londonbased curwood a cheesepackaging business which bemis acquired in  concluded his career as bemis top executive he transformed bemis in the s and s to focus on its core flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials businesses while shedding divisions that didnt fit after graduating from uwmadison in 7 jeff curler rose through the ranks and helped bemis technical teams continue its innovative edge using proprietary processes and material science expertise to accelerate product development my philosophy always was you cant get ahead just because you have the same name curler said youve got to work as hard if not harder than anybody else melanie miller bemis vice president of investor relations treasurer said jeff curler took the business further he took what his father left him and expanded it internationally and continued to grow as the leader globally and really took the technology focus and the innovation focus that his father had started and continued to expand it around bemis she said both miller and henry theisen who succeeded curler as president and ceo credited curlers listening skills vision decisiveness and lowkey but open leadership style for helping to grow bemis which will exceed  billion in sales this year a lot of the core technologies that allowed curwood bemis largest division to grow and bemis to grow were developed under his leadership theisen said jeff has always promoted technology innovation and problem solving the companys board of directors in november renamed one of its buildings in neenah the jeffrey h curler bemis innovation center recognizing his contributions to the business looking back reflecting on his early days curler recalled his first office in the new london plant curler dove into research and development of basic film development searching for ways to extend product shelf lives and provide customer convenience in packaging he recognized his father whom he described as a neat entrepreneurial guy had invented curpolene  a combination of polypropylene and cellophane in the s that gave curwood a technological edge as a cheese packaging material that was really kind of the building block for the success of curwood he said from the beginning curwood was the most profitable part of bemis co along the way bemis bought a plant in kentucky that made nylon resin the guy that ran that business was just a genius in regards to polymer chemistry curler said i learned a lot from him and it was a lot of fun we developed some nylon films that were so totally unique in the industry that we just took over markets even today we probably have  percent of all of the bacon packaging that was because of our development of unique nylon films bemis interestingly started  years before curwood did curler said of bemis brothers bag co which started in  making cotton bags for grain and other items the packaging business evolved from cotton to burlap to paper then plastic thanks in part to his chemical engineering background and leadership bemis today has a strong technical base in polymer chemistry film extrusion coating and laminating printing and converting during the s bemis created packaging solutions for customer convenience including frozen entree trays heatnpouches and vacuumpacked brick pack coffee packages in our company we have a lot of patented products curler said we also have a lot of process technology thats unique to us when curler was promoted to a variety of management roles over the years he also exhibited a strong business acumen that helped leverage the bemis technical expertise grow the customer base and generate financial strength that positioned the firm as a market leader with a global reach in  when curler became bemis president the firm had sales of  billion and 7 employees today bemis has  facilities in  countries and employs about  people worldwide including  in the us  in wisconsin 77 in the fox valley and  in its neenah corporate headquarters companies have to grow curler said if youre not moving ahead you go the other way curler said his most important decision came when bemis moved into brazil we are the largest packaging company in south america he said we have over  billion in sales in that part of the world that was a very important decision its a very profitable region of the world for us right now for a company that was once focused on being more north americancentric curler said now about a third of our sales are outside of north america and a big chunk of that is in south america miller said curler did an extraordinary job dealing with bemis shareholders explaining the benefits of such things as blow film technology or metalized film versus foil lamination he really has been an icon of bemis the last decade with the shareholder base and really helped educate the shareholders on the commonsense chemical engineering behind the products that were making she said during plant tours with shareholders curler had the answers to virtually any questions about machines he probably could run the machine if we really wanted him to miller said and he could very often walk up to the operator and shake their hand and know their first name it was fun the familiarity he had with the business and the operations headquarters moves curler said the relocation of bemis headquarters from minneapolis to neenah in  was a logical move we had committed to this area as far as operations i thought that if we were going to make this company bigger and better in the future it would be good for the whole executive management team to be closer to what we actually did he said we had a real commitment to wisconsin and the operations and the amount of net worth of the company that was over here asked what he is most proud of curler said im really proud of the fact that i was able to blend a very good business career with a great family life as for retirement curler doesnt have any firm plans  except to continuing serving on the board of directors of a minneapolis firm and keep visiting an office at one neenah center in downtown neenah its been tradition at bemis that the retiring ceo chairman can keep an office as long as they want he said so i have an office there actually it had been my fathers office so im going to have a place to go to read the wall street journal news provided by comtex privacy statement  copyright   the plastics exchange llc  patent protected  all rights

business success share tweet pinit by brian beutler published october    am views ron johnson’s campaign for wisconsin senate is premised largely on the notion that he’s a successful businessman who knows how to create jobsjohnson owns a plastics company called pacur in oshkosh wi according to a recent report by the business research firm investext pacur enjoyed estimated annual sales of  million and employeed  people in  his spokeswoman sara sendek says it’s a bit bigger than that — about  employeeswith unemployment sky high johnson’s been able to capitalize politically on his success and has been leading his opponent sen russ feingold dwi in the polls since july “i’m not a politician” johnson says in a recent ad “i’m an accountant and a manufacturer i know how to balance a budget and i do know how to create jobs’ however johnson’s usually mum about the fact that one of his largest clients is bemis a publicly traded company founded by his nowdeceased father in law and currently run by his brother in law jeffrey curler“certainly ron had help and support starting his business as many businesses do but ron has also worked incredibly hard in every phase of the business to make it successful” sendek saysjohnson joined pacur in 7 to help a different brotherinlaw pat curler run what had — until then — been a curler family business in fact the name pacur is the hybrid of the names pat and curleraccording to proxy statements bemis filed with the sec “during  we and our subsidiaries purchased at market competitive prices approximately  million of polyester and polyester copolymer products from pacur inc ronald johnson brotherinlaw of jeffrey h curler is president of pacur inc mr curler is chairman of the board of the company and our executive chairman”bemis has made similar major purchases every year going back years ranging in size from  million in  to  million in sendek says that bemis now constitutes less than  percent of pacur’s business the investext numbers imply more than that but in any case sendek says “they would still be viable without it”but it wasn’t always that wayaccording to johnson’s campaign bio “with the help and dedication of the fine people ron had the privilege of working with pacur has grown from a company supplying a single customer to the largest producer in the world of a specialty plastic used in medical device packaging and high tech printing applications”that single customer bemis or rather the company that became bemis according to the northwesternersendek says that in the years since pacur has done business with about  clients in  countriesbroadly speaking johnson’s company extrudes rolls of rigid polyester and sells those rolls to bemis which further converts them and sells them all to medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companiesone source with knowledge of the plastics industry in the midwest questions why bemis even needs to contract out to pacur for the plastics “why in the world would a company like bemis not have the technology” the source asked “they could make a better film today”johnson’s critics have argued that these details belie the image johnson is trying to create for himself of an upbythebootstraps entrepreneur if johnson wins anyhow he’ll join several dozen other members of the senate who’ve had a leg up in life the tpm poll average gives johnson a  lead over feingold one of the senate’s most liberal members if johnson wins it will likely constitute the most dramatic singleseat swing from left to right of the entire cycle about the author brian beutler follow brianbeutler
