quarter today our consistent performance underscores our strengths we have a leading cloudbased platform with innovative technology and an expanding set of product capabilities we have a strong customerfocused culture that our customers recognize and our employees and customers value and we have a global footprint and an expanding partner ecosystem the result is steady growth of new customers and a consistently high renewal rate and our strong growth in net new acv through upsells is driving deeper enterprise integration and expansion of our capabilities with leading companies across diverse industries were becoming a more relevant strategic partner to their digital transformation our top two accounts now exceed  million in acv and we now have more than  customers doing more than  million in acv with us including  hitting that number in q when i spoke to you last quarter at the time just three weeks into the job i shared that my top priority was listening and learning from our customers that has continued to be my focus customer listening and learning are constant operating motions deeply embedded in our servicenow culture we listen build what our customers want and need and learn from their experiences and then we repeat that cycle over and over servicenow founder fred luddy set that tone from day  with his vision of enabling regular people to route work effectively through an enterprise and our opportunity to fulfill that vision is greater than ever i met with  customers in my first  days and i then had the privilege to be with more than  customers and partners worldwide at our knowledge event in may which was our biggest knowledge yet knowledge was extraordinarily energizing with companies such as ge and novartis sharing how they are using servicenow to transform their businesses spending the week engaging with our customers partners and developers further elevated my excitement about being part of servicenow as we create our next chapter the world is at an inflection point of intense digital disruption which necessitates that every company focus on digital transformation every company i talk to is experiencing this for it organizations cios and csuite leaders grappling with these changes and challenges we intend to become an indispensible enterprise cloud partner and helping them create the future of work during my conversations with customers im asking three simple questions how are we doing where can we get better and what are your biggest priorities let me quickly recap what our customers are telling me first our customers absolutely love our products and platform and they appreciate how we work with them and do business itsm has been a gamechanger for our customers and they want to do more with us thats reflected in our q renewal rate of  we have a strong foundation and as i discussed in my keynote at knowledge our customers want us to continue to lead and innovate with best inclass outofthebox integrations and configurations and with more consumerlike enduser experiences and they want to hear more from us about our roadmap and product vision these are priorities for us creating best inclass customer experiences improving our end user experience and driving customer success were already increasing our investment and management focus in these areas were also committed to developing a robust highly skilled partner ecosystem as ive said before many of the worlds largest systems integrators are rapidly investing in servicenows ecosystem and our partners are critical to the success of our customers and therefore to our collective future increasingly were being leveraged across the enterprise as customers pull our platform and multiproduct capabilities into hr customer service management and security in q  of our net new acv came outside of itsm compared with  a year ago and today three out of every four customers license more than one servicenow product our newest products helped drive our strong q results and are being recognized as bestinclass for example our hr product addresses a key customer need which is complementary to leading hcm vendors this product drove the acquisition of a significant new customer in q a leading airline with net new acv of almost  million and our hr product also resulted in net new acv of almost  million with one of our largest existing customers our customer service management product also is demonstrating great momentum in q for example a leading provider of healthcare technology became a new customer with net new acv above  million solely with customer service management in addition the product debuted in gartners magic quadrant in q and was named by forrester research in its forrester wave for customer service solutions thats tremendous recognition for a product in its first year as we continue to evolve we also continue to innovate we ended q with the completion of our jakarta release which is now generally available as we demonstrated at knowledge jakarta delivers significant performance and user experience enhancements we continue to be strongly committed to building on our leadership position in itsm and itom as well as expanding our capabilities for hr csm and security our jakarta release also builds intelligent automation into our platform bringing machine learning capabilities to all of our products and all of our customers for their everyday work were solving real challenges for enterprises today while also enabling their transformation to a digital future servicenow facilitates new ways of working driving greater efficiency and productivity and that in turn creates real business value and opportunity for our customers in closing we see tremendous opportunity as we drive deeper engagement with cios and csuite executives increasing our relevance across the enterprise im incredibly proud to be part of this organization and we intend to continue to serve our customers partners and employees i look forward to continuing our progress and momentum and with that ill turn the call back over to mike michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc thank you john during todays call we will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for q and fullyear  wed like to point out that the company reports nongaap results in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap all financial figures we will discuss today are nongaap except for revenues and revenue growth to see the reconciliation between these nongaap and gaap results please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarters previously filed press releases all of which are posted at investorsservicenowcom

longterm investments in may we issued  million of  convertible senior notes due in  the primary use of proceeds is to refinance our existing  million of  convertible notes due upon maturity in  in conjunction with this offering we purchased a bond hedge and sold warrants to eliminate shareholder dilution up to a  stock price if the stock price increases above  the  warrant exercise price only the incremental value above  will be dilutive as we plan to settle the principal in cash lets turn to guidance for the third quarter and fullyear  for the third quarter we expect total revenues between  million and  million representing  to  yearoveryear growth and  to  adjusted growth or a  million impact we expect total billings between  million and  million representing  to  yearoveryear

and free cash flow margin of  we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately  million for the year and now expect to add approximately  net employees in  with that operator you can now open up the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of matt hedberg with rbc capital markets your line is open please go ahead matthew george hedberg  rbc capital markets llc hey guys congrats on the strong results john the mix of new acv from nonitsm and itom products i believe is a record at  versus i think what was a record last quarter of  and in your prepared remarks you talked security hr customer service deals but it really was that millionplus customer service management win that was really interesting to me as a new customer win can you give a little bit more detail on why they chose servicenow versus other vendors and how they think about expanding into other areas of your platform john j donahoe  servicenow inc sure matt well obviously customer service management is a huge market and the area where our product has a real sweet spot is in situations where a customer is dealing with a large volume of inbound contacts andor that theyve got to deal with root causes to reduce the human interaction so the kind of situations were strong at is when you take those high inbound volumes much like you get inbound incidents to an it helpdesk or a hr case management youve got high inbound volume and you want to automate how you respond creating as much selfhelp as possible and the way you do that is to get to what the root cause of the inbound incidents are and so our product is very well suited to that to help identify what the root cause is so that you can then remediate without a lot of expensive human interaction and so thats the kind of use case where our product plays well and its turning out to be an entrée point in the commercial market and many customers and in this case in the enterprise market and then as you know once weve sort of landed an account the opportunity to expand laterally into our other products is much easier so its in many ways using the same functionality we have in our other products applied to a csm use case matthew george hedberg  rbc capital markets llc thats great maybe just a quick followup you guys made an acquisition of qlue kind of building on the dxcontinuum acquisition clearly customers are asking for more machinelearning capabilities intelligent automation predictive capabilities but i guess can you help define how this functionality helps with new wins and maybe the monetization effort of that thank you john j donahoe  servicenow inc whats interesting is what we hear from both existing customers and new customers are that there is a huge amount of new technologies out there and theyre having trouble keeping up what are the ones they need to pay attention to what are the ones they need to be building themselves and what were saying is that there is certain functionality that we will take responsibility for accessing and acquiring and make it easier for them to use so machine learning we started with dxcontinuum where we bought dxcontinuum and were integrating machine learning into our platform so that all products and all customers can access it and therefore the customer only has to worry about using their data they dont have to worry about acquiring their own machinelearning capability virtual agent technology which is the way to obviously automate and streamline a response whether its an it response an hr response or csm response is another technology and by buying qlue well sort of repeat that same formula of replatforming it into our platform recoding it into our platform and making it available to them so they dont have to buy their own chatbot capability or other virtual agent capability and well continue to do that were looking at a number of other technologies all of which i characterize as being complementary to the core thing we do which is helping them automate their workflows improve the ability to have selfhelp and provide better experiences for their employees and customers matthew george hedberg  rbc capital markets llc well done john j donahoe  servicenow inc thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of rob owens with keybanc capital markets your line is open please go ahead rob owens  keybanc capital markets inc great and thanks for taking my question given the volatility youve seen over the past couple of quarters and your sequential acv growth per gk customer can you speak to the dynamics of customer acquisition and what its contributing and how followon plays out because your customer acquisition has obviously been running well ahead over the last couple of years but weve seen that variability i guess in the acv number so any color would be appreciated thanks michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc yeah so rob its mike here so if you recall when we laid out our model that  is an average growth quarteroverquarter obviously its not the reality of the world this is not a spreadsheet that it continues to grow through  we do see seasonality you saw that last year typically the second half of the year is a much bigger upsell quarter so we do expect that the second half of this year and we see that already with the number of contracted upsells that have closed already as well as what is sitting in our pipeline of opportunities that are heavily weighted towards upsell so i feel very good about that number still the other thing that weighs down upon that number when we came up with that  three years ago that was based upon adding  global  per quarter we continued to add well above that and if you remember our average global  we land typically is much lower than what people think if you look at last quarter it was  the quarter before it was  and that is very typical and its once we land them then they continue to grow from there so we feel very good about what were seeing there rob owens  keybanc capital markets inc is there any different dynamic given a lot of the incremental global  obviously are likely to come out of apac and other versus your penetration in north america and emea which are both  or greater at this point is there a different acv that you experience with apac and other geos michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc no i have actually already closed two global  this quarter in apac that are greater than the average of our global  today rob owens  keybanc capital markets inc great thanks for the color mike operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of keith weiss with morgan stanley your line is open please go ahead keith eric weiss  morgan stanley  co llc excellent thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter a question for john when you talked to us at analyst day you were basically talking about hey listen my number one job here is listening and youve done a lot of listening and talked to a lot of customers is it still too soon to be thinking about any changes that youd want to make to sort of distribution or how you guys are planning on gotomarket from what youve learned or is it just sort of you guys are operating pretty well as is so youre going to let well enough alone in the near term john j donahoe  servicenow inc well keith i think – i dont know if youd characterize this as gotomarket but we are increasing our focus on the full customer lifecycle right we have a worldclass sales force and a worldclass gotomarket motion and i dont see any need for significant change in that in fact i really admire – im struck by how nicely our sales team has layered in product specialists and layered in the industry focus as well as continued to recut territories to serve customers and more deeply penetrate in our sort of presales through sales motion the area where were increasing our focus is in the sort of full customer lifecycle postsale all the way through renewal where what i heard from customers was help me implement and help me get maximum value out of the product and then help me translate that into business value that we can demonstrate and the interesting thing is our products do drive real business value right we automate workflows which is sort of at the root cause of productivity but what we are going to do is put a little more focus on customer success so that were capturing and documenting and codifying the business value that gets created which helps a cio or an it department within their organization demonstrate the value they are driving inside their company and frankly helps us on upsells on price realization and on landing new accounts so i would say the more focus on the full customer lifecycle particularly post sales through renewal we already have a number of things going on there but were trying to bring them together in a more cohesive and powerful way both presale and post keith eric weiss  morgan stanley  co llc excellent and if i could sneak in one followup weve heard a lot last year about sort of increasing partner commitments if you will and more partners coming to the ecosystem is it too soon to be seeing the results of that of them sort of driving more business for you guys is that still in development are you starting to see those results john j donahoe  servicenow inc both i think id say we see some results but our partners are clearly playing a very important role in influencing deals particularly with gk customers we think roughly twothirds of our net new acv was influenced by partners roughly a third was sourced by partners and so were already seeing that impact and certainly our top partners are quite important partners that said i was meeting with a cio of one of our top partners this morning in our ebc and as we talk it feels to me like there is still opportunity where we can more comprehensively and effectively work together to both bring our joint products to market every company is struggling with digital transformation and that takes both great software and great process reengineering support to sort of implement it were talking about even tighter collaboration on product development and sharing rd and roadmaps together and so i feel like there is still additional opportunity to get even more mutual benefit out of our top partner relationships keith eric weiss  morgan stanley  co llc excellent thank you very much guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of kirk materne with evercore isi your line is open please go ahead kirk materne  evercore group llc hi thanks very much john you mentioned a couple of the bigger hr wins this quarter and it seems to us that more of your customers and partners are talking about your hr onboarding offering and i notice you all are also a diamond sponsor at the hr tech show this year so which would seem to indicate you guys want to get the message out there so could you just talk about the opportunity you see for servicenow around the hr function and what do you think has to happen to sort of realize that opportunity and this really quick followup for mike mike obviously a really good quarter but you also took up guidance for the back half of the year which would seem to indicate you feel good about the trends heading into the third quarter is there anything else we should sort of read into the guidance going up for the back half of the year from a billings perspective thanks john j donahoe  servicenow inc yeah kirk on your first question on what you described as hr here is what i see and i think were experiencing it the change is that virtually every company and every ceo is making modernizing the employee experience a priority right millennials are demanding that they get the same kind of experiences at work as they are getting at home and so almost every company is saying how can we provide a more compelling employee experience at work and thats the macro trend thats creating the macro demand now whats interesting when you think about it as employee experience employee experience is a lot more than just hr its their full endtoend experience and thats where we excel so take employee onboarding employee onboarding is a multidepartmental experience right it touches youve got to get your badge from facilities youve got to get your desk – sorry badge from security your desk from facilities youve got to get your laptop from it youve got to deal with finance youve got to deal with compliance you have to deal with hr so its more than just an hr experience its the full endtoend experience and thats where our platform and our capabilities are really strong same thing with hr case management same thing with employee portal which is by definition a multifunctional portal and so our sweet spot is something that can help drive endtoend good experiences workflows the way talk about it to improve the employee experience and so thats whats driving really strong demand for our hr products and we think thats going to continue and ill note as i have several times that is very complementary with what the hcm providers are providing its not in competition with them but very complementary to provide the best endtoend working together we provide the best endtoend employee experiences for our customers michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc and then kirk on your question with regards to billings the uptick in our billings guidance for the full year is really a result of the overachievement in our net new acv in the quarter coupled with the opportunity we see on the subscription side fx also impacted that very positively you see where the euro is at relative to where it was when we gave guidance last quarter but on top of that there is a negative headwind that we did take down our professional services slightly by about  million in revenue which directly flows through the billings and thats really more because as weve talked about quite some bit for the last couple years were really shifting more of our professional services the implementation work to our gsis and partners because we really want to focus more on the highlevel solution architect the deployment of our new products and training kirk materne  evercore group llc super thanks very much guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of walter pritchard with citi your line is open please go ahead walter h pritchard  citigroup global markets inc thanks question for john just on ma the company has been very id say measured in acquisitions that have been done and im wondering youve been – your quarter under your belt is there a need in some of these markets – it feels like your priority has to be on driving the broader opportunity is there a need to expand that ma activity as you look at some of these markets that are maybe further afield from your core in it and you might want to jumpstart or otherwise accelerate the efforts there john j donahoe  servicenow inc walter i think one of the real strengths of the company has been this practice of taking literally virtually every single acquisition and recoding it into the platform so that we do have one platform that all applications and all customers can pull from and the thing thats striking about this company is the organic innovation that weve been able to pull off and so whether its the new products around itom around hr customer support and security that organic innovation is whats driving our growth and that is enhanced by having one platform when you have multiple platforms you get more complexity you get less organic innovation and so i think this formula of saying lets look for acquisitions that may bring a functionality a capability such as machine learning or virtual agents or the itapp capability that were now using in cloud management bring those in recode them into our platform so theyre natively available which then drives a very high organic innovation flywheel and as long as thats working there is no need to disrupt that momentum we feel like there is very good growth opportunity with our existing application set the other interesting thing is weve got a whole host of applications or a whole host of use cases where customers are already using our platform on workflows and use cases that we dont have an outofthebox functionality with and we will over time evaluate which of those we want to bring into our core product line and so i see a pretty strong innovation pipeline thats not dependent upon ma walter h pritchard  citigroup global markets inc great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of abhey lamba with mizuho securities your line is open please go ahead abhey rattan lamba  mizuho securities usa inc yeah thank you and congrats on a great quarter guys john or mike i have a question on customer feedback on the jakarta release what type of feedback are you getting from them what are the kind of features that partners and customers are most excited about and in particular if you can talk about the adoption are you expecting the adoption of jakarta to be faster or slower than the previous releases thank you john j donahoe  servicenow inc well the first thing we should say it was only released generally available last week so – but clearly the feedback from knowledge and since then has just been very very strong on a number of dimensions whether its the enhancements that farrell made to itsm to make the preconfiguration that makes integration and upgrades more easy and allows faster time to value or additional functionality like software asset management or cloud management thats being released with jakarta two new products great examples of organically extending our platform to address a key need in our customer software they are having an explosion of different software inside and managing that software tracking and managing its a key need and our software management asset management product does that and then they have got multiple clouds and how they manage the clouds is a growing and new and emerging need and our cloud management product and cloud management capability is helping to address that so there are a number of both id say refinements to existing products and new features and functionality in jakarta there is a lot of excitement about it but to be honest theyre just now upgrading and implementing them and well be very aggressive at ensuring that our customers get real value out of those anything you would add mike michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc no ill just add remember we deal with very large enterprise customers and feedback on new releases generally when they adopt a new release they put it into a test environment to make sure they test out everything before they go live so it generally takes a number of months after the release before we get real feedback i will say just internally software asset management is the one that interests me we adopted that within the first couple of weeks of doing it we had a software audit that came in and saved – were a small company  so i was pretty pleased with that because we werent using it i dont think we would have saved that at all we are already seeing in software asset management weve seen a  deal for that so im pretty excited about that and im excited about what weve done with both the security ops with the trusted circles as well as the brightpoint acquisition is now native and we talked about that at our users conference but also what were seeing in hr and improvements weve done there and the fact that in our csm product we now have communities inside there built into that so a lot of excitement across the board with our entire portfolio abhey rattan lamba  mizuho securities usa inc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of justin furby with william blair  company your line is open please go ahead justin a furby  william blair  co llc thanks guys and congrats on the quarter i guess a couple from me first either for john or mike i was hoping you could unpack the  acv a little bit youve got a number of products in there hr security ops cx and others as well im just wondering if there is any one that dominates that in terms of what you saw in q and if you look at the pipeline if its pretty balanced and then specifically for software assets since you just mentioned it mike where will that go in terms of these different buckets and what does the pricing look like for that and then ive got a followup thanks michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc so we continue to see strength in all of our emerging products as john called out hr was a very very strong quarter for us and i would say second followed customer service itom was a very big quarter i know youre not calling out that we are very pleased with that we saw in itom and then i would say third was customer or security ops was third we continue to see a lot of excitement and pipeline built within the security ops product but hr and csm are driving bigger deals for us in terms of software asset management that will be disclosed as one of our emerging products that other  going forward and the pricing on that is really based upon the number of servers that you have out there justin a furby  william blair  co llc okay john j donahoe  servicenow inc yeah justin a furby  william blair  co llc super helpful and then on the guide for q it looks like particularly on the subscription billing it seems abnormally strong from a sequential standpoint i think youre guiding for something like  growth and last year i think the guidance was more like  you talked a little bit about this but is that just a abnormally normally strong start to q is it timing of renewals or what else is there to think about in terms of seasonality and thats it thanks john j donahoe  servicenow inc its both its a lot of backlog not just renewals that is going to be built as well as the strength that we see in our pipeline of opportunities justin a furby  william blair  co llc got it thanks very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of raimo lenschow with barclays your line is open please go ahead raimo lenschow  barclays capital inc hey thanks for taking my question question for john if ill – now that youve had a good few months in the company and if you look at the vendors like its the highest renewal rate i see in saas its very very strategic what is the feedback that you get from in talking to all the guys that you know in industry that are not yet customers in terms of if you have engagement with them like what are they thinking about you versus other guys and whats kind of the dialogue that you have around that one and a quick question for mike then is if i look in q you did beat us quite a bit on operating margin but again in q was slightly lighter was there a timing thing in terms of cost et cetera that we should be aware of thank you john j donahoe  servicenow inc well raimo ive sort of struck  days in on sort of two levels about what customers and as you say notyet customers obviously within every it department servicenow is very well known and for those that are not yet customers often they either have a renewal of their existing provider thats coming up and i think well have an atbat if you will in almost every one of those cases or they havent yet gotten to using software to structure unstructured workflows and the impetus is on us to demonstrate to them the business value and productivity value that they will get from using our itsm and core it products and so i think we continue to add new logos simply because where we do focus our energies and effort we are successful at penetrating the other observation id make is outside of it and the csuite in some ways servicenow is one of the bestkept secrets in world in that our brand awareness outside of it is not what it i think it can be and in particular as i said earlier the brand awareness of how we drive business value how we drive productivity how we drive an enhanced and improved employee experience how we drive improved end customer experiences where our platform is being exposed to end customers that is i think an opportunity for us to raise our visibility and raise our awareness and its one of those wonderful situations where the substance is ahead of the perception and so i think one of the things were going to be doing is trying to bring the awareness and perception in line with the substance and i think well – when people understand what it is we do and what it is we can do and how it can drive business value for them all it will do is enhance what is an already strong sales motion michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc and raimo that ties in partly to the answer to your question so the first thing in q we did have overachievement on the operating margin that was partially due to timing of expenses but namely some of the linearity within the hiring there were also some expenses that got pushed out into q but what we did make a decision and this is part of the thing what john just talked about is we are going to try to elevate our brand awareness at a company level as well as at a certain product level with some of our emerging products because we see the opportunity and thats reflected in our operating margin which is still within the guidance that we gave for the beginning of the year were still confirming  operating margin for the full year and on top of that were adding more employees too as were seeing the opportunity to invest more heavily both in our sales organization and sales and marketing to go after these opportunities that were seeing raimo lenschow  barclays capital inc perfect thank you congrats operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of sarah hindlian with macquarie your line is open please go ahead sarah hindlian  macquarie capital usa inc all right thank you very much congratulations on the quarter guys and thanks for taking my questions john the first one for you youre seeing a lot of strength in your forbes  adds another  this quarter which is up yearoveryear and sequentially and it looks pretty good across the globe but i wanted to dig into some of the regional performance and what youre seeing in the pipeline in both europe and asiapac and then mike i wanted to followup with you on asc  id love to hear where we are and what we should be expecting from you on that accounting change michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc so actually sarah im going to jump in right now kind of the global  yes we had very good strength across the global   we continue to see in our pipeline a large pipeline of new opportunities but in the past quarter asiapac was a little light on landing new global  however as i did just mention we did have two that closed already quartertodate this quarter so you do see variability i cant stress enough these global  sales are extremely long sales cycles we see that globally thats not unique to any one region as an example we landed two global s this past quarter that were as new customers that were fiveplusyears sales cycles we upsold another global  where we finally got the mothership that they are committed to land once again that was a fourplusyear upsell they were a very small customer and are now continuing to grow so im not concerned about the strength in global  adds in any one geo in any particular quarter looking at it more on an annual basis and we do see very good distribution both historically and whats in our pipeline going forward john j donahoe  servicenow inc and the thing id just add to that from a more of a macro perspective is one of the things that we look at is cloud adoption cloud adoption differs by country and so there are a couple markets that our enormous markets where cloud adoption has been a little behind but is now beginning to kick in japan being one of them and a huge market cloud a little bit more slowly adopted now were beginning to see its more common among the large japanese multinationals and leading companies to be embracing cloud with some of the same fervor thats being done in the us and other places similarly germany germany is a huge market with a lot of very large companies and cloud adoption germany has been just a little bit more slow for all sorts of reasons privacy security and others but were beginning to see some early signs there of that market moving along a little bit so i think thats another positive indicator on the global expansion horizon as more and more countries begin embracing cloud with the same vigor that the us uk and others have michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc and then on the second part of your question sarah on asc  i did spend quite a bit of time at our financial analyst day going over asc  in may was not planning on giving any update right now we continue to move through with the adoption of that and in october call ill update people on the impact of that sarah hindlian  macquarie capital usa inc all right thats perfect thank you guys so much and congrats on the quarter appreciate it michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of karl keirstead with deutsche bank your line is open please go ahead karl e keirstead  deutsche bank securities inc great mike question for you on free cash flow i remember super strong in q and you warned us all that that was a little bit of an unusual cash flow generation quarter but q solid as well actually and through the first half youre now running at  free cash flow margins your fullyear guide is  so what would cause the free cash flow margins to compress in the second half given that your operating margins should likely be up yearoveryear thank you michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc so believe it or not q is generally one of the strongest quarters and if you do look on our investor deck we just posted that we did go over with you guys at our financial analyst day page  q is so high because of the amount of contracts that we have that start on december  through january  of the cash flows through in q when you do that billing yes q is a strong quarter q has a negative impact of the employee stock purchase plan because we used a fair bit of cash that weve collected in the previous six months that goes out thats probably the biggest impact and as a reminder we did tell people for the full year if were in high growth were going to add  to  in free cash flow margin and were continuing to deliver above that this year karl e keirstead  deutsche bank securities inc okay good thanks mike michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of michael turits with raymond james your line is open please go ahead michael turits  raymond james  associates inc hi can you hear me michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc yes michael turits  raymond james  associates inc id like to drill down a little bit on keiths question about goto market and the need for change there i know you said that youre in pretty good shape but there have been a really big expansion in the amount of products and in the areas in which you have products including in areas like infrastructure where youre doing more automation so what makes you feel that you have the right structure exactly what it is and how do you scale out and broaden the scope such that you can make sure that you deliver all those products and sell them john j donahoe  servicenow inc well michael maybe both of us can comment on this different points of view because – ill just say as a relative newcomer its not that we – i dont think we have it all figured out but i am really impressed with dave schneider kevin haverty our sales leadership team of how theyre continuing to evolve it each year and theyre evolving it by as i said earlier adding product sales overlay adding some of the verticals how theyre expanding geography and theyre doing it in a way where customers dont see a lot of dislocation and thats not an easy thing to do the other thing thats striking to me is that as we get larger its allowing more focus on our customers so we have two huge wins the two large wins in q where as mike said things that took many years and we went back and asked the reps three years ago how many accounts were you covering and in both cases they were covering  to  somewhere between  and  accounts and both cases those were – the very same reps this year are only covering  accounts and what that allows them to do is to walk the hallways even if its a nonpaying customer its a potential customer theyre walking the hallways theyre understanding those customers needs theyre demonstrating our capabilities theyre building relationships and so the value of scale is allowing a greater customer focus which helps with existing customers as well as helps us penetrate new large customers because we simply have more sales time per customer and so we will continue to evolve more in    as we grow our product portfolio and grow our scale so i think what i was commenting on earlier is just that that dynamic ability to do that in a way that deepens relationships and does not create discontinuity is whats certainly striking to me as impressive in my early months michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc i would echo what john said and i would also say is that obviously what weve been doing has been working as you see the expansion outside of itsm in our emerging products obviously we continue to look at this there may be more vertical focus later on down the path but we dont expect any changes in  michael turits  raymond james  associates inc thanks john thanks mike operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of greg mcdowell with jmp securities your line is open please go ahead greg r mcdowell  jmp securities llc great thank you very much two quick questions the first one is if you could provide any color on sort of commercial sales team performance versus the enterprise sales team performance and then one quick mechanical question mike i noticed there is a uptick in the contract term lengths for new customers and i was just wondering if there is anything behind that thanks michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc so we had very good performance of the commercial team the commercial team i think hit  of their number we had a very good quarter as i mentioned the overachievement in our net new acv is kind of whats driving billing so were very pleased with what were seeing across the board with both enterprise and commercial on your comment on average contract term not that much to read into that other than it was a very strong global  quarter with  that we added the gks tend to like longerterm contracts to lock in pricing for a period of time as a reminder we do try to incent our sales force to sell a threeyear contract weve had quarters that have kind of been in that  before i dont find it that unusual the  greg r mcdowell  jmp securities llc okay thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of sterling auty with jpmorgan sic jpmorgan  your line is open please go ahead sterling auty  jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys jpmorgan just one quick one i missed it if you said it but any color that you can give us in terms of the experience in demand by vertical industry in the quarter and specifically government as we head into the governments final fiscal quarter michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc we saw strength across the board financials we saw it in the healthcare we did some very nice government deals this past quarter so no one industry to call out i would say it was strength across all sterling auty  jpmorgan securities llc got it thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of kash rangan with bank of americamerrill lynch your line is open please go ahead kash rangan  bank of americamerrill lynch hi congrats on the quarter and pardon the directness of the question with the mix of business the way it shook out the nonitsm was it as you expected going into q and if so what does the sales pipeline of potentially new business look like does that reflect the change in your business mix maybe if i am overthinking this do you expect conversely itsm to rebound because i think there was at least one quarter last year when itsm was a little bit sluggish and i can remember frank saying that its going to bounce back and it did i am wondering which of the two ways to interpret the mix of results because if it is the former i believe that the value drivers for itsm are very different from the value drivers for nonitsm therefore what we have come to depend upon the predictability of a replacement cycle of all service management systems that gives way to a different kind of machinery  sales increasing mix of your business from machinery  customer support analytics hr et cetera so if thats the case – im sorry for the complicated question but if thats the case then how are you going to be thinking about how youve organized your sales force because the selling skills and the motions are very very different sorry for the longwinded question michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc thanks kash so first of all those percentages are of acv were actually not telling you with the actual acv is and what i will add is of the  global   of them were itsm i cant stress enough itsm is what lands us in the door and once we get into itsm then were able to upsell and we are continuing to see strength in itsm if you look at our jakarta release we are very focused on a lot of the enhancements we are doing within itsm but i dont disagree with you on value the it is a very different value than hr and customer service and we are seeing we can extract more value on the hr and customer service but if you dont have itsm you dont have that opportunity so we do see a very good pipeline of opportunity in the second half of the year across the board i do expect the emerging products – as youd expect were investing heavily in these – will continue to grow at a bigger pace than the itsm but we are seeing growth in itsm and itsm is the bulk of our revenue today and will be the bulk of our revenue for quite some time john j donahoe  servicenow inc and kash what id add to that is its striking to me is that when you actually get inside these customers and talk to them they view us as a platform i mean this is not a series of disparate products that are unrelated to one another they in many if not most cases have embraced our platform and even though the decisionmaker in hr hr product or security or csm is not the cio explicitly the cio and it does play a role both because weve established credibility and payback in it and it is involved in the implementation outside of it as well and so there is a – its not quite as far afield as it may look from the outside in that its from the same platform the products do there is a high degree of overlap on what the product functionality is and the role of it is a real asset and our credibility with it within the company is a real asset kash rangan  bank of americamerrill lynch thank you very much john and mike congratulations again operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jesse hulsing with goldman sachs your line is open please go ahead jesse hulsing  goldman sachs  co llc yeah thank you hey guys i have a couple questions but first for john whats your philosophy on isps and expanding that opportunity are you doing anything to increase your investment on third parties building on servicenow and then a quick one maybe for mike how are sales cycles trending yearoveryear in your nonitsm business i guess im curious as you build up more awareness around these solutions and get them reference customers if youre starting to see those come down john j donahoe  servicenow inc yeah on our platform our platform as i said a minute ago is a huge asset and what our customers tell us is internal developers find it easy to build on fast to build on extensible quite easily and so thats an obvious opportunity to open that up and make that more available to isvs and thirdparty developers then as we grow and expand thats a natural way to grow and expand our functionality as well whether its more vertical specific requirements that isps can develop or new markets new use cases and so were absolutely investing and making sure the platform is easy to build upon as possible we have our store its relatively nascent but there is i think over  now applications in the store and thats growing and so it will be a continued and increasing area of focus and investment as we go forward michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc ill also add jesse we did make four investments last quarter in isvs that are building their businesses on servicenows platform the other thing on your other question on sales cycles we continue to see really no change in the itsm sales cycle remember thats a replacement cycle i talked about earlier how long it is in the global  its still nineplusmonth on average initial sales cycle we are seeing some shorter sales cycles in some of the emerging products in particular hr and customer service dont know if thats a trend that will be going forward but we do see in some of the newer products shorter sales cycles and there are some shorter sales cycles on upsells and we are very much focused too on having contractual upsells with customers right now as well jesse hulsing  goldman sachs  co llc all right thanks bye operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of phil winslow with wells fargo your line is open please go ahead philip winslow  wells fargo securities llc hey thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter you all touched on a lot on the hr itom customer service but hoping you could give us some flavor for what youre seeing in the it security management your analytics because obviously the growth in that other acv line has been really impressive this year john j donahoe  servicenow inc well i think all the products are doing well we just chose to flag and highlight the ones that stood out but security operations is obviously a huge market were just going through tremendous high demand and our product is a natural complement to many of the other products in that market and is addressing one of the most fundamental dilemma cesos have which is an explosion of inbound contacts whether its from their existing nodes or its the internet of things theres just an explosion of inbound contacts and the ability to address or remediate those in as an automated way as possible so that they put their human energies on the ones that really matter is a key need and so the security operations product continue to sell well two of our top five deals in the quarter included security and its a natural addon product along with the itsm and itom and similarly analytics had a strong quarter it was included in  of our top  deals so frankly the highest count of all products and it was a strong contributor to net new acv its not as big a line item so to speak but its very prevalent and most customers are buying analytics along with the other products philip winslow  wells fargo securities llc got it and then mike just one quick housekeeping item i think last year the net expense associated with nols  was  million im wondering if youd give us that for this year as well michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc the net expense is somewhere in these  million to  million i dont remember exactly the amount going through there philip winslow  wells fargo securities llc got it all right thanks guys operator thank you and our last question will come from the line of richard davis with canaccord your line is open please go ahead richard davis  canaccord genuity inc yeah thanks john this may be a question for you its a short question but maybe a little harder to answer so if you kind of think about when salesforce really kicked it into another gear is when they became kind of a strategic partner to their customers on the revenue side and you guys have touched on this on and off throughout the conversation tonight to what extent do you think you guys are there and if you are not what do you need to do to get there john j donahoe  servicenow inc well i think we have – richard i think its an excellent question and i think my early read is we have all the potential to get there in that there is clear demand in every company is dealing with digital transformation every company needs to find productivity in their operations so that they can take that productivity savings and reinvest it in innovation with their own customers and fundamentally at the end of the day what we do is by automating workflows were driving productivity were helping improve the employee experience and so i think the fundamentals are there i think we can do a better job of capturing the business value were creating codifying capturing it and communicating it and interestingly our customers are asking for that it is typically not talked about what they do inside the company in business value terms theyre increasingly being asked to do so and so just as i think you talked about sales force when that focus became unmeasurable incremental revenue they became a more strategic partner in our case driving greater productivity driving greater employee experience better employee experience which as i said earlier is a core requirement and demand for most customers and driving better endcustomer experience and yes you heard actually from ge talk about that at our knowledge where were being pulled to the end customers and so those are measurable business outcomes that were helping to contribute toward those are csuite kind of issues and i think were wellpositioned to capture and codify what were doing linking it to that and that will continue to make us more relevant and strategic both to it and beyond richard davis  canaccord genuity inc perfect thank you very much appreciate it operator thank you and id now like to turn the conference back over to michael scarpelli for any closing remarks michael p scarpelli  servicenow inc so

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
