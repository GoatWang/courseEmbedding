stellar rise friday january   when mr danny yong started what is now dymon asia macro fund with us million in  billionaire investor paul tudor jones’ hedge fund company was his first outside backer six years later mr yong’s onetime upstart has grown to us billion s billion in assets and delivered the secondbest performance of any large asiabased hedge fund bloomberg markets magazine will report in its february issue from its perch in singapore dymon asia macro returned  per cent in the first  months of last year only the quantedge global fund’s  per cent topped it in asia in bloomberg markets’ annual ranking of funds with us billion or more in assets dymon was also a standout worldwide it came in at no  among all large funds in a bad year for some macro funds which seek to profit from trends in currencies interest rates and equities and commodities markets managers of big asiafocused funds can struggle to deliver consistent gains markets are smaller and less liquid than those in the us and europe and there is a limited pool of talented professionals to run the funds mr yong  who has a resume that includes goldman sachs group has  years of experience trading asian securities dymon asia macro returned  per cent from august  through last october according to a source that compares with a  per cent loss for the hfrx macrocta index which measures macro hedge funds and the socalled commoditytrading advisers that trade futures and forward contracts on commodities financial assets and currencies the dymon fund’s only calendar year loss was for its inaugural five months in  in  dymon asia macro topped all us billion–plus asian funds with a return of more than  per cent after fees “dymon over the years demonstrated strong risk management” says mr stephane pizzo managing partner of singaporebased lotus peak capital which invests in hedge funds “this allows them to limit losses during quiet months while fully participating when the move finally happens” dymon asia macro took advantage of the lull in major market moves during the first half of last year says mr david chan chief executive of dymon asia capital singapore the management firm that oversees us billion of assets including the macro fund he says the fund bought cheap options to benefit from trends it expected to crystallise in later months one of the most profitable bets was on china’s yuan the currency had dropped  per cent against the us dollar in trading outside china in the first four months mr yong says he expected the yuan would rebound and finish the year roughly where it started dymon bought call options which gave it the right to buy the yuan at a specified price during a specified period the currency strengthened  per cent from april to the end of october in trading outside of china “since the global financial crisis market cycles have shortened and trends are often interspersed with violent corrections that make holding on to longterm positions more challenging” says mr yong who is also chief investment officer of dymon asia capital “using options has allowed us to structure trades with compelling riskreward profiles and allows us to generate superior returns when we call the market right” the us federal reserve handed hedge funds last year’s most anticipated trading catalyst the central bank announced in late october that it would end the asset buying that underpinned its third round of quantitative easing the fed’s purchases were designed to boost economic growth and investor confidence unlike some peers who bet treasury bond prices would decline as a result mr yong sought to gain from a stronger us economy by going long on the us dollar against the japanese yen the strategy had two benefits it shielded dymon investors from the largest oneday decline since  in us treasury yields on oct  a drop that reversed in the following days it also allowed dymon to profit from additional stimulus moves and pension reforms mr yong says he expected would lead japan’s currency lower dymon boosted the size of its bet against the yen convinced the japanese economy was running out of steam from aug  the day the secondquarter gross domestic product gdp number was announced through oct  the us dollar strengthened  per cent against japan’s currency it had extended the gain by a further  per cent as of the end of last month after the bank of japan decided to expand the stimulus in late october on nov  the country announced it had slipped back into recession in the third quarter mr yong has lived through plenty of asia’s turmoil in a year career he joined what is now jpmorgan chase  co as a trader on the asian marketsderivatives and fixedincome desk in  just months before the region’s financial crisis he moved to goldman sachs’ hong kong derivatives trading desk in  then spent   years with the firm in japan in  citadel hired him to set up and run asian currencies interestrates relativevalue and macro trading in hong kong for the
