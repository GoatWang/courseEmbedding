available to the at least one tij description background of the invention  technical field the present invention relates to collection and administration of taxes resulting from transactions between sellers and buyers of goods and services and further relates to enforcement of compliance with tax laws of jurisdictions who are legal parties to such transactions  related art buyers of goods and services are becoming quite sophisticated about making purchases of products from sellers who are located outside of the buyers sales or consumption tax imposing jurisdiction for example many buyers purchase products on the internet the seller is not responsible for the collection of tax from buyers outside of their jurisdiction so no sales or consumption tax is collected many buyers of goods and services are technically responsible for the voluntary payment of a “use tax” on such purchases but fail to pay such taxes to the tax imposing jurisdiction in which they reside either because the buyers are not aware of laws governing use tax or the buyers are simply not going to voluntarily comply with such laws thus tax imposing jurisdictions are experiencing a decline in reported taxable transactions involving goods and services and an associated decline in tax revenues each tax imposing jurisdiction finds it difficult to force compliance since no comprehensive system of compliance currently exists to require buyers and sellers to comply with the applicable laws that should be applied to the transactions in question in addition tax imposing jurisdictions as well as sellers serving as tax agents for the tax imposing jurisdictions incur substantial collection administrative and compliance costs relating to taxes due to the complexity of tax laws which are different across different tax imposing jurisdictions thus there is a need for a method and system that enables a tax imposing jurisdiction to collect taxes from a buyer residing therein for a transaction between the buyer and seller where the seller is not legally responsible for the collection of such tax there is also a need for a method and system that simplifies the collection administration and compliance process relating to such taxes while taking into consideration the reality that tax laws will vary among different tax imposing jurisdictions reflecting the needs of different tax imposing

clearinghouse may be based on and open standards architecture and may employ an application program interface “api” the present invention including the methods principles computerbased systems and related hardware and software products and implementations are collectively referred to as a “network system”the network system addresses all of the preceding issues the network system leverages and extends existing electronic networks and electronic payment networks to create a lowcost infrastructure focused on the needs of tax imposing jurisdictions as well as the needs of sellers to reduce their role and administrative expense in the collection of tax that is fundamentally imposed on the consumption of goods and services by buyers tax imposing jurisdictions are provided with the capability for frequent or more immediate access to information on transactions tax calculations and tax finds in a secure clearinghouse environment certain transactions that are passing into or through the network may be selected to be audited and verified electronically resulting in a reduction in the costs associated with tax collection compliance and administration for the tax imposing jurisdiction sellers can rely on thenetwork system to audit and verify their tax calculations and transfer taxes collected by the merchant seller automatically to the clearinghouse thus eliminating a substantial administrative and compliance burden on the part of the seller it is conceivable that to the extent transactions are processed through the network system merchant sellers could virtually eliminate the need to prepare individual tax returns to the extent that transactions that would normally be compiled and summarized to prepare the tax returns are already reported through the network system additionally the network system alleviates tax imposing jurisdictions of the substantial burden associated with auditing and verifying taxes and instead enables the tax imposing jurisdictions to focus their scarce resources and attention toward other processes including analyzing the way in which buyers and sellers are applying tax laws to the transactions they are reporting though the network system the tax imposing jurisdictions are free to maintain their own tax rates and laws and do not have to adopt any common or simplified approach to tax calculations although they would certainly be free to do so and still employ the network system because the network system may be designed around open standards each tax imposing jurisdiction may have the freedom and flexibility to access data directly or indirectly through an api so that the network system might be connected to existing legacy systems of the tax imposing jurisdictions or to new systems with the assistance of employees of the tax imposing jurisdictions or with the assistance of approved government service providers or other service providers as the case may be from the operational viewpoint of the tax imposing jurisdictions the network system and associated clearinghouse provides them the flexibility to apply their own laws and business rules to the processing and analysis of transactions they are a party to rather than being forced to adopt a single way of doing business the invention provides methods systems and computer program product to assist tax imposing jurisdictions in accessing and aggregating data from electronic payment networks andor electronic networks the present invention provides methods systems and computer program product to assist tax imposing jurisdictions in auditing

interface  see fig  to accomplish tasks in addition to those that may be accomplished connecting intercept processor  see fig  to such electronic payment network andor electronic network  via other program communication methods  see fig  fig  is a flowchart depicting a processing of tax aspects of a sale of goods andor services from a seller to a buyer in conjunction with the network system of figs  and  in accordance with embodiments of the present invention fig  depicts an implementation of the present invention dealing with an electronic payment network “epn” such as a credit card processing network and the ways by which the present invention accesses transaction data fields associated with transactions which are then processed by intercept processor  see fig  the process may be performed by the network or a gst or other service provider one of the first steps taken by the credit card processing network is credit card authorization or authorization defined as the process of verifying that the credit debit corporate or other electronic payment network andor electronic network card or account associated with such card has sufficient funds or credit available to cover the amount of the transaction an authorization transaction generally does not transfer funds rather the authorization process places a hold on the cardholders opentobuy limit lowering the cardholders limit by the amount of the amount authorized this authorization is a “first step” of an authorization and delayed capture transaction wherein the “second step” of the authorization and delayed capture transaction namely the capture occurs at a later point in time when the goods andor services have been shipped for goods or provided for services to the buyer for purposes of the implementation presented in fig  it is assumed that the credit card transaction being conducted is an authorized transaction a collection of transaction data associated with one or more transactions is passing through an electronic payment network andor electronic network this is referred to or defined as a “data streamdatabase”  data streamdatabase  in this example case is arising through the aggregation of transaction data from many different merchant sellers via many different communication methods and protocols data streamdatabase  permits employment of either a data stream or a database alternative if the data stream alternative of the data streamdatabase  is employed then step  recognizes in transactions and associated transaction data fields in the data stream  through a software program or application designed to read or interpret data while in the data stream performed by intercept processor —see fig  the software program or application may read or interpret original data metadata associated with original data or a copy of the original data depending on the particular implementation of the present invention with a particular electronic payment network or electronic network if the database alternative of the data streamdatabase  is employed then step  obtains data can by accessing a database containing such data preferably after the authorization process has been completed although such database could also be accessed prior to the beginning of the authorization process performed by authorization processor —see fig  in step  a determination is made as to whether the transaction has successfully completed the authorization process performed by authorization processor —see fig  and received authorization for payment by the credit card company if the answer in step  is “no” then processing of the transaction and associated transaction data fields terminates in step  if the answer in step  is “yes” two processes next occur with one of the two processes beginning in step  and the other of the two processes beginning in step  respectively in step  a copy is created performed by intercept processor —see fig  of the transaction data fields associated with the authorized transaction from reading original data metadata or a copy of the original data depending on the specific implementation of the present invention with the electronic payment network andor electronic network in step  a unique tax transaction identification “id” eg a number is assigned performed by intercept processor —see fig  an alternative implementation is to accept a transaction number already assigned by the credit card company or other credit card authorization service provider to the transaction as the unique tax transaction id of step  performed by intercept processor —see fig  in step  the unique tax transaction id of step  is appended to transaction data fields associated with the data streamdatabase  performed by intercept processor —see fig  while not required for the operation of the present invention the process of appending may be accomplished by transmitting the tax unique transaction id  performed by intercept processor —see fig  to the credit card company where such data may be either written to a database maintained by the credit card company or the data could reenter the data stream for association or appending step  while other processes unrelated to the present invention are occurring to the extent that the unique tax transaction id in step  references a tax transaction number assigned by a credit card company or other credit card authorization service provider there is no need to append a unique transaction id to data or a database maintained by a credit card company or credit card authorization service provider this determination is made in step  by intercept processor  see fig  the unique tax transaction id may be maintained in a database owned by or for the benefit of the merchant seller the result of this is that a transaction that has completed the authorization process  has a unique tax transaction id  assigned but the transaction has not yet been through the steps required for capture and the transaction has not yet completed the audit and verify process of step  step  performed by intercept processor —see fig  appends the unique tax transaction id of step  to the copy of transaction data field information previously generated in step  ie step  is performed after steps  and  are performed the transaction data fields are next analyzed by the audit and verify process in step  performed by rules processor —see fig  to determine inter alia if the tax liability provided in the transaction data fields with respect to the associated transaction is accurate or within a range deemed acceptable by the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions based upon their applicable tax laws examples of outcomes that may occur in the audit and verify process of step  include but are not limited to  a determination that a recalculated tax liability within the audit and verify step  is acceptable based upon the tax laws of the tax imposing jurisdiction applied to the transaction data fields associated with the transaction  a determination based on transaction data fields associated with the transaction that no tax liability exists  a determination based on transaction data fields associated with the transaction that the sellers use tax or the buyers use tax is applicable to the transaction but no such taxes were identified for payment since the merchant seller did not have a nexus with the buyer and  a determination based on transaction data fields associated with the transaction that the original tax calculation as provided in the transaction data fields from the original data stream is mathematically inaccurate an alternative embodiment of the present invention includes examining the transaction data fields associated with a transaction performed by rules processor —see fig  to determine if data exists relating to the tax calculation software application employed by the merchant seller to perform tax calculations to the extent the software application that has been certified by an independent party recognized by the applicable tax imposing jurisdiction for producing accurate and reliable tax calculations for the specific type of tax calculation being calculated the software is deemed a “certified tax calculation application” and different processes may be applied to transaction data fields associated with tax calculations where such calculations have been performed by a certified tax calculation application examples of said different processes include but are not limited to  accepting such calculations with no separate audit and verify process while still creating audited transaction data field information in step  and  employing a statistical or sampling algorithm to select transactions and associated transaction data fields for auditing and verifying calculation in step  performed by rules processor —see fig  where such tax calculations were performed by a certified tax calculation application while still creating audited transaction data field information in step  after the audit and verify process of step  performed by rules processor —see fig  has been completed with respect to transaction data fields associated with the transaction audited transaction data fields are created in step  performed by rules processor —see fig  the audited transaction data fields comprise the data contained in the transaction data fields as well as such data to indicate the audit and verify process has been completed including the types of tax or taxes the transaction data fields were tested for the results of such tests variances if any between the tax liability as provided in the transaction data fields and tax liabilities as recalculated in the audit and verify process the audited transaction data field information created in  are appended to or merged into  the transaction data fields maintained by the credit card company andor merchant seller in step  and  the transaction data fields maintained within the present invention in step  steps  and  are performed by rules processor  see fig  in step  performed by aggregation server —see fig  the audited tax transaction data fields and any associated data are transferred to the database  see fig  and this portion of the process ends in step  while not required for operation of the present invention the credit card company andor merchant appends or merges audited transaction data fields in step  to the associated with the data streamdatabase  for an embodiment in which the merchant seller is a legal agent for the collection of tax from the buyer and also for payment of such tax to the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions step  a “credit” step makes entries ie “credits” in the accounts of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions thus increasing the balance of the account of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions by the amount of the tax liability in the audited transaction data fields a corresponding “counter entry” ie “debit” is made to the account of the merchant seller in step  a “debit” step performed by aggregation server —see fig  thus decreasing the balance of the account by the amount of the tax liability that will be transferred to the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions after step  the process ends in step  an alternative implementation to eliminate step  and reduce step  is to retain the copy of the transaction data field information generated in step  for subsequent use in step  until a unique tax transaction id is assigned in step  and the audit and verify process step  has been completed the results of step  is then combined into the audited transaction data field information of step  and is next appended or merged by the credit card company andor merchant in step  performed by intercept processor  andor aggregation server —see fig  since the copy of the transaction data field information of step  has been updated to provide for appending the unique tax transaction id of step  and completing the audit and verify process of step  the append step  is no longer necessary and the audited transaction data fields are transferred in step  to database  see fig  and this portion of the process ends in step  in an alternative embodiment relating to fig  in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyers credit card there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction and the merchant seller has no legal obligation to report the transaction to a tax imposing jurisdiction that is legally permitted to collect a tax on the transaction as an example the transaction may occur over the internet such that the buyer is legally obligated to pay a use tax to a tax imposing jurisdiction but the merchant seller is not required to report the transaction to the tax imposing jurisdiction the process of fig  applies to this alternative embodiment with the exception that the credit and debit steps  and  respectively are not performed nonetheless all of the transaction data fields have been recorded in the database  in step  since the tax imposing jurisdictions may periodically query the database  via any of the software mechanisms    andor  of fig  as described supra this alternative embodiment of the present invention offers tax imposing jurisdictions practical mechanisms for tax collection for situations in which no practical tax collection mechanism existed previously in the related art in an alternative embodiment relating to fig  in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyers credit card the credit card company or other epn or en is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction the process of fig  applies to this alternative embodiment with the exception that the debit step  is modified as follows in step  the corresponding “counter entry” ie “debit” is made to the account of the credit card company instead of to the merchant seller since in this embodiment the credit card company rather than the merchant seller is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction in an alternative embodiment relating to fig  in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyers credit card the clearinghouse  see fig  is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction at the time when authorization for the transaction between the buyer and merchant seller occurs the financing network eg the credit card company credits the account of the clearinghouse  for the amount of tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction otherwise the process of fig  applies to this alternative embodiment with the exception that the debit step  is modified as follows in step  the corresponding “counter entry” ie “debit” is made to the account of the clearinghouse  instead of to the merchant seller since in this embodiment the clearinghouse  rather than the merchant seller is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction in an alternative embodiment relating to fig  in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyers credit card there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction and the tax imposing jurisdiction is legally entitled to receive the tax from the financing network eg the credit card company when authorization for payment of the transaction by the financing network occurs at which time the credit financing network pays the amount of tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction otherwise the process of fig  applies to this alternative embodiment with the exception that the credit and debit steps  and  respectively are not performed in summary in relation to the process of fig  in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyers credit card the present invention provides the aforementioned five embodiments revolving around agency relationships and the performance or nonperformance of associated credit and debit steps  and  respectively in the first such embodiment the seller is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction in the second such embodiment there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction in the third such embodiment the credit card company is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction in the fourth such embodiment the clearinghouse  see fig  is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction in the fifth such embodiment there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction and the tax imposing jurisdiction is legally entitled to receive the tax from the financing network ie the electronic network or the electronic payment network at the time of occurrence of the transaction if at least two of the aforementioned five embodiments may potentially prevail in a transaction in an implementation of the present invention then the transaction data field may include an indication of which of the preceding five embodiments applies and supporting data required for the implementation if any for each tax imposing jurisdiction involved in the transaction examples of at least two of the aforementioned five embodiments prevailing in a transaction are as follows wherein the transaction comprises a first tij and a second tij such that the first and second tijs are different tijs in a first example there is a first legal agent to the transaction for collection and payment of the tax due to the first tij and there is no legal agent to the transaction for collection and payment of the tax due to the second tij in a first special case of the first example the first legal agent is the seller the financing network or the clearinghouse  see fig  in a second special case of the first example the second tij is legally entitled to receive its tax due at the time of occurrence of said authorization in a second example there is a first legal agent to the transaction for collection and payment of the tax due to the first tij and there is a second agent to the transaction for collection and payment of the tax due to the second tij wherein the first and second agents are different agents each selected from the group consisting of the seller the financing network and the clearinghouse  see fig  since the buyer engages in only a single credit card transaction regardless of which of the aforementioned five embodiments applies the implementation details pertaining to the relevant embodiments of the aforementioned five embodiments is essentially or substantially transparent to the buyer which is a major convenience for the buyer the following example illustrates the aforementioned five embodiments of fig  this example illustrates a transaction in which a buyer who could also be referred to as the taxpayer is making a purchase from a merchant seller for  and decides to settle the transaction by paying with a credit card in the first embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example the merchant seller operates an internet web site and is located in a same tax imposing jurisdiction as the taxpayer buyer the seller has “nexus” which is the condition of the merchant seller having sufficient presence in a tax imposing jurisdiction relating to the buyer to be subject to specific laws of that tax imposing jurisdiction with respect to the collection of tax as a tax agent on behalf of such tax imposing jurisdiction the merchant seller collects information from the taxpayer buyer including all transaction data fields necessary for the calculation of sales tax which in this case amounts to a total of  based upon a tax rate of  a rate which combines a  rate of tax assessed by the county the buyer is located in and an additional  rate assessed by the state the buyer is located in the merchant seller completes the calculation of tax via a computer program located on the sellers computer or point of sale device calculates a total amount due from the buyer  comprised of the original amount of the purchase plus associated sales tax and forwards the details of the transaction and associated transaction data fields to the buyers credit card company the merchant seller accepts the buyers credit card through a “card not present merchant account” which is a merchant account required to be maintained by the buyer who is also referred to as the “merchant” when doing business over the internet the credit card company receives the information related to the transaction including the associated transaction data fields and begins the authorization process with respect to the buyers credit card in step  the present invention recognizes transaction data fields from the data streamdatabase  of the credit card company and concludes in step  that the transaction has already been authorized thus a copy of the transaction data fields are made in step  a unique tax transaction id is assigned in step  and appended to the copy  of the transaction data fields in step  as well as being appended to the original transaction data fields  in step  in step  the transaction data fields are audited and verified and determined to be accurate in step  the audited transaction data field information is created indicating accurate tax calculations and a tax liability of  payable to one tax imposing jurisdiction namely the county where the buyer and seller are located as well as  payable to another tax imposing jurisdiction namely the state where the buyer and merchant seller are located in step  these audited transaction data fields are appended or merged with the data stream or database containing the original transaction data fields in step  an entry is made in the account of the county to record an amount payable directly to such county for  and an entry is made in the account of the state to record an amount payable directly to such state for  in step  an entry is made in the account of the merchant seller recording a total liability of  in step  the audited transaction data fields are appended or merged with the transaction data fields copy and transferred in step  to database  see fig  where such data may be further accessed by the respective state and county tax authorities via any of mechanisms  of fig  the tax liabilities in this example will be paid to the state and local tax authorities or made available to them in their clearinghouse  see fig  account as soon as the credit card capture transaction occurs in the second embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example if the merchant seller has no physical location or place of business in the state of the buyer the seller may not have nexus and therefore is not responsible under existing tax law for the collection of tax from the buyer with respect to the tax imposing jurisdiction of the buyer assuming all other facts associated with the transaction remaining the same the merchant seller calculates the total amount to be charged to the credit card  when the transaction data fields are audited and verified in step  performed by rules server —see fig  a determination is made by aggregation server —see fig  that while the merchant seller is not responsible for the collection of taxes based upon current law the buyer is nonetheless responsible for a use tax payable to tax imposing jurisdictions audited transaction data field information is created in step  and transferred back to the credit card company in step  performed by intercept processor —see fig  and also in step  to the database  see fig  performed by aggregation server —see fig  where it is available for further analysis and further processing by such state and county tax authorities via any of mechanisms  of fig  the tax imposing jurisdiction could charge the credit card of the buyer for  of use tax the tax imposing jurisdiction in this case a state tax authority could also charge the additional  on behalf of the county if the state had an agency relationship with such county tax authority however since the tax has been identified as relating to such county and the county has access to funds with the credit card company directly via step  or through the clearinghouse  see fig  functionality the county tax authority may want to take direct responsibility for management of its own tax affairs by accessing the database  see fig  via a number of different alternatives such as employing a software product or service application  see fig  the tax imposing jurisdiction could also access the clearinghouse  see fig  through a custom or productservice application  see fig  by accessing the database  see fig  andor the clearinghouse  see fig  in this way the state tax authority could choose from a variety of different processing options including but not limited to sending a notice to the buyer or request the credit card company to include such notice in its next credit card account statement mailed to the buyer accumulating such use tax liabilities based upon state defined business rules and notifying the taxpayer when the amounts exceed a predetermined threshold with amounts below that threshold amount automatically treated as a tax liability that is automatically added to the appropriate state income tax return at year end the state tax authority might also consider automatically charging a service fee to defray the cost of individually collecting use tax in the third embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example the credit card company is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction the process of fig  applies to this third embodiment as compared with the first embodiment with the exception that the debit step  is modified as follows in step  the corresponding “counter entry” ie “debit” of  is made to the account of the credit card company instead of to the merchant seller since in this embodiment the credit card company rather than the merchant seller is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction in the fourth embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example the clearinghouse  see fig  is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction at the time when the transaction between the buyer and merchant seller occurs the credit card company credits  to the account of the clearinghouse  for the amount of tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction otherwise the process of fig  applies to this fourth embodiment as compared with the first embodiment with the exception that the debit step  is modified as follows in step  the corresponding “counter entry” ie “debit” of  is made to the account of the clearinghouse  instead of to the merchant seller since in this embodiment the clearinghouse  rather than the merchant seller is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction in the fifth embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection of the  tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction and the tax imposing jurisdiction is legally entitled to receive the tax  at the time of occurrence of the transaction at the time when the transaction between the buyer and merchant seller occurs the credit card company pays the amount of tax due  to the tax imposing jurisdiction otherwise the process of fig  applies to this alternative embodiment with the exception that the credit and debit steps  and  respectively are not performed an alternative embodiment of the present invention is the processing of a credit transaction through a credit card relating to returned merchandise seeking credit or a voided transaction in such a case the steps outlined in fig  are all performed with the exception that all dollar amounts are computed as credits or negative amounts in an alternative embodiment of the present invention in fig  the credit card company determines that it does not want to implement steps required to enable the present invention to connect to the credit card companys data stream database  for the purpose of assigning a transaction id in step  and conducting audit and verify procedures in step  instead the credit card company determines it will simply identify tax liabilities relating to transactions making an entry in the account of the tax imposing jurisdiction  and simultaneously making a corresponding counter entry  in the account of the merchant seller followed by providing related transaction data fields available to parties including the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions fig  is a flowchart depicting a processing of tax aspects of a sale of goods andor services from a seller to a buyer in conjunction with the network system of figs  and  in accordance with alternative embodiments of the present invention fig  relates to situations in which the electronic payment network andor electronic network does not rely on the credit card authorization and capture process or a similar process to initiate the payment for goods or services rendered in contrast with fig  the authorization and capture process of fig  is fundamentally designed to extend immediate credit to a buyer for immediate or near immediate payment of liabilities incurred for the purchase of goods and services in such case of fig  the credit risk associated with the payment for goods and services has been eliminated by the seller and instead replaced by a credit risk borne by the credit card company extending credit to the buyer of goods andor services for near immediate payment to the merchant seller absent the authorization and capture process electronic payment networks and electronic networks generally bear the credit risk associated with the sale of goods and services requiring a different implementation of the present invention the credit card authorization and capture from a merchant sellers perspective generally signals payment for goods andor services rendered in the embodiments of fig  the same seller makes a sale and does not collect immediate payment via cash check or credit card and the seller is extending credit to the buyer through the creation of a balance due or account receivable from the buyer in such cases the intercept processor  see fig  communicates with a tax liability processor  see fig  to collect transaction data fields tax liability processor  see fig  is designed to systematically recognize sales made and payments are received by buyers relating to amounts outstanding from sellers accounts when payment for the transaction has been received from the buyer the transaction is classified as a “paidup” transaction first the transaction database  relating to sales and amounts due accounts receivable etc is polled in step  performed by intercept processor —see fig  for information relevant to executing subsequent steps  and  step  determines if there is any transactions associated new sales booked if the answer in step  is “yes” then a sequence of steps  is next executed if the answer in step  is “no” then step  performed by intercept processor —see fig  determines if there are any new data relating to the collection of amounts due on pending transactions a “pending” transaction is a transaction that has previously been initiated but payment by the buyer for the transaction has not yet been detected in step  when payment for the transaction has been detected in step  the transaction is classified as a “paidup” transaction if the answer in step  is “yes” then a sequence of steps  is next executed if the answer in step  is “no” then the process loops back to the polling step  thus the process of fig  executes the sequence of steps  when new data on sales books is detected and the sequence of steps  when new data relating to the collection of amounts due on previous transactions is detected in alternative embodiments the polling step  is not a separate step but is instead performed within step  and within step  in the execution of steps  new data on sales books is detected step  obtains transaction data fields associated with new transactions from the transaction database  performed by intercept processor —see fig  step  assigns a unique tax transaction id to the transaction performed by intercept processor —see fig  appends the unique tax transaction id to the transaction data fields and also performs audit and verify on the transaction data fields in a manner that is essentially or substantially the same as the audit and verify step  of fig  performed by rules processor —see fig  after step  such data are considered audited transaction data fields atdf which are next appended or merged in step  performed by aggregation server —see fig  step  updates the database  performed by aggregation server —see fig  to include the audited transaction data fields the process ends in step  or alternatively the process returns to the loop of steps   and  not shown to resume the polling of the transaction database  in the execution of steps  new data relating to the collection of amounts due on previous pending transactions is detected so that the transaction has become a paidup transaction step  obtains audited transaction data fields associated with the transaction from the transaction database  performed by intercept processor —see fig  step  makes an entry to credit the account of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions performed by aggregation server —see fig  to whom the tax is payable to and the associated funds are transferred to the clearinghouse  see fig  relating to such tax liabilities performed by aggregation server —see fig  step  debits the account of the merchant seller by the amount of such tax liabilities in step  database  see fig  is updated to reflect the receipt of payment and the associated audited transaction data fields are updated accordingly the process ends in step  or alternatively the process returns to the loop of steps   and  not shown to resume the polling of the transaction database  the following example further illustrates embodiments of fig  this example illustrates a transaction in which a buyer who could also be referred to as the taxpayer is making a purchase from a merchant seller for  and decides to settle the transaction by requesting the merchant seller to extend credit providing the buyer with  days to pay for his purchase the merchant seller is located in the same jurisdiction as the buyer the merchant seller has “nexus” which is the condition of the seller having sufficient presence in a tax imposing jurisdiction with respect to the collection of tax as a tax agent on behalf of such tax imposing jurisdiction the merchant seller collects information from the taxpayer buyer including all transaction data fields necessary for the calculation of sales tax which in this case amounts to a total of  based upon a tax rate of  a rate which combines a  rate of tax assessed by the county the buyer is located in and an additional  rate assessed by the state the buyer is located in the merchant seller completes the calculation of tax by submitting appropriate transaction data fields to the electronic network tax liability processor  see fig  for calculation of tax in the present example the tax liability processor  is provided by a gst whose programs have been certified as accurate and therefore requiring no further recalculation the tax liability processor  calculates the tax liability of  which is then combined with the amount of the purchase  to determine the total amount due from the buyer  comprised of the original amount of the purchase plus associated sales tax and forwards the details of the transaction and associated transaction data fields to the merchant sellers accounting department to record the sale as an account receivable such amount could also be entered into the transaction database  of the merchant seller directly through the sellers point of sale or other similar software program for this example the iterative looping though steps   and  proceeds with possible transient departures from this loop when new data on new sales booked is detected in step  until collection of the tax  is detected in step  which triggers execution of the steps  step  credits the amount of tax  to the account of the tax imposing jurisdiction step  debits the account of the merchant seller by the amount  of the tax liability and step  updates the database  see fig  an alternative embodiment is to credit the account of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions in step  for tax liabilities based upon the tax laws of the tax imposing jurisdiction and make a counter entry in the account of the merchant seller eg at step  regardless of whether funds were collected by the merchant seller an alternative embodiment is to credit the account of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions in step  and also to transfer funds from the merchant seller to the financialtreasurydata services clearinghouse  see fig  eg at step  this could be performed by intercept processor  see fig  or aggregation server  see fig  an alternative embodiment of the present invention in application to both fig  and fig  is to skip or override the functions provided by aggregation server  see fig  and enable the processes performed by the intercept processor  see fig  and rules processor  see fig  to poll the database  see fig  directly and merge or append updates to such data directly possibly by accessing metadata relating to the database  see fig  as some other examples of the present invention which examples are by no way an exhaustive list of applications if a national sales tax was implemented the infrastructure employed by the system of the present invention could facilitate the distribution of collected revenues to an appropriate revenue agency further issues of distributing a tax collected at only one point to different entities will arise constantly many state sales taxes are in fact a bundled charge combining different tax imposing jurisdictions such as a county rate along with a state rate of tax also in the formation of the european union a tax may only be collected at a final point of sale but such a tax may be required to be distributed among different revenue agencies which can encompass different countries in this instance the system of the present invention is specifically designed to be effective in ensuring the efficient and appropriate break out and routing of such collected tax revenues the mechanisms and processes set forth in the present description may be implemented using a conventional and general purpose

encryption—the process of changing data into a form that can be read only by the intended receiver to decipher the message the receiver of the encrypted data must have the proper decryption key in traditional encryption schemes the sender and the receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data publickey encryption schemes use two keys a public key which anyone may use and a corresponding private key which is possessed only by the person who created it with this method anyone may send a message encrypted with the owners public key but only the owner has the private key necessary to decrypt it pgp pretty good privacy and des data encryption standard are two of the most popular publickey encryption schemes pgp or other encryptionhashing techniques can employ for example data symbol encryption such as with direct sequence or frequency hopping spread spectrum communications where the communications symbols are spread with a pseudo random noise code similarly error detection and correction coding such as an inner bch code followed by an outer convolution code adds an additional degree of data protection while serving to preserve information integrity environment—a collection of hardware software network communications and procedures that work together to provide a discrete type of computer service there may be one or more environments on a physical platform eg test production an environment has unique features and characteristics that dictate how they are administered in similar yet diverse manners fault tolerance—a design method that ensures continued system operation in the event of individual failures by providing redundant elements at the component level designers include redundant chips and circuits and add the capability to bypass faults automatically at the computer system level they replicate any elements likely to fail such as processors and large disk drives faulttolerant operations often require backup or ups power systems in the event of a main power failure and may imply the duplication of entire computer systems in remote locations to protect against vandalism acts of war or natural disaster also referred to occasionally as disaster tolerance also includes other successor technologies that advance the capabilities described above failover—a process or scheme for the transfer of operation from a failed component eg controller disk drive to a similar redundant component to ensure uninterrupted data flow and operability for example in multi path driver if the current path fails io is rerouted through a redundant path so that the system can continue production operations also includes other successor technologies that advance the capabilities described above fiber channel—a highlyreliable gigabit interconnect
