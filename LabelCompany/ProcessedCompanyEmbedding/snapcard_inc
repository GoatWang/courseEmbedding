merchants  •  merchants  •  companies  •  startups online startup snapcard wants to make it easier to use bitcoins online by skipping merchant integration altogether snapcard users can purchase items from major retailers even if their ecommerce platform doesnt accept bitcoin users can also avoid logging into a retailers website michael dunworth snapcards cofounder said we want to make the shopping process as easy and fast for bitcoin users as possible snapcard offers a bookmarklet that users can click on when they visit a products page the bookmarklet automatically grabs information from the product like price and quantity to create an item in snapcards shopping cart after this users can login to snapcard and checkout their shopping cart automatically using their linked coinbase wallet users can also choose to receive an invoice from snapcard which will allow them to pay with a wallet of their choice or fiat currencylinked debit or credit cards snapcard acts as a kind of payment processor debiting the transaction amount from the user and making the purchase with the merchant according to dunworth the companys service currently works on target best buy new egg amazon and walmart after launching a closed beta on th november snapcard is now available to the public the service has around  users and has completed transactions worth more than  he said the selection of goods available ranges from macbooks to beef jerky mainly from sites like ebay and amazon occasionally he has observed some particularly unusual purchases he commented that in the past someone had once bought a competitive racing snail from switzerland dunworth hopes that a positive response from snapcard users would demonstrate to merchants the importance of accepting bitcoin on their sites he said because of the reluctance among bigger merchants to accept bitcoins we feel snapcard gives us an opportunity to see what users are spending their money on and show  merchants that there is an opportunity among the bitcoin community for shoppers snapcards biggest disadvantage is its  transaction fee there are other drawbacks too not all purchasing formats are supported on snapcard for example users can purchase ebay items with a buy it now price but cannot bid on auction items additionally users cannot apply merchant incentives like amazon prime to their purchases by contrast rival platform gyft offers users a discount for paying in bitcoin gyfts service lets users buy gift cards from merchants like target using bitcoin and other payment modes in gyfts case if users pay in bitcoin they are given the equivalent of  of what theyve spent in gyfts loyalty points each loyalty point is worth  gyft users paying with paypal only get  and those paying with credit cards get half of that dunworth said he is working on offering similar incentives to his users in the future he added we would need to offer incentives to users  we want to stay competitive unlike gyft dunworth said his service didnt lock in shoppers at the bitcoin exchange rate when a giftcard was purchased instead snapcard users can trade their bitcoins for fiat currency at the current exchange rate when they make a purchase snapcard has raised funding from boost an accelerator and investment fund that has also invested in coinbase dunworths background lies in australias financial services previous to snapcard he started full society – a service that let restaurants in sydney offer daily discounts he met snapcard cofounder ioannis giannaros last april when they boarded at the same hacker house in san francisco giannaros had previously worked in online marketing and search engine optimisation dunworth said that he and giannaros became involved in bitcoin at the start of the year alongside another partner giannaros and dunworth were the trio behind superhero laundry a business that saw them clean and deliver san franciscos dirty laundry whilst dressed as superheroes that effort proved to be popular with the citys denizens but the service has been put on ice so the duo can focus on snapcard the leader in blockchain news coindesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the
