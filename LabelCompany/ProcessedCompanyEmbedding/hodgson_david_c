a career choice finding meaning in work and life  huffpost tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you edition us arabi australia brasil canada deutschland españa france greece india italia japan korea maghreb méxico québec south africa united kingdom united states close the blog 00 0 am et  updated aug 0  social entrepreneurship soars as a career choice finding meaning in work and life by david c hodgson k has social entrepreneur become a career of choice twentyfive years ago at the founding of echoing green an organization that provides seed money and support to promising social entrepreneurs young people wanted to be doctors lawyers or business executives no one ever said they wanted to be a social entrepreneur very few people had even heard the term which was coined by bill drayton who in  founded ashoka a global association of the worlds leading social entrepreneurs yet today i often hear young people say i want to be a social entrepreneur now being a social entrepreneur is a real choice popularized by great examples think of the founders of teach for america freelancers union and city year all of which were launched by echoing green fellows and supported by university curricula the surge in interest is reflected in echoing greens annual call for fellows this year we received over 00 applications for just  spots each potential fellow proposed a bold idea to help solve some of the worlds most difficult problems at our recent big bold benefit  finalists from  countries shared their ideas before an audience of social entrepreneurs business people media and others they also met with the expert panels tasked with choosing echoing greens  fellows the new fellows who will share a  million award in addition to training mentoring and other support will be announced in june listening to the finalists i was deeply impressed by the audacity of the finalists projects to provide legal representation to death row inmates in pakistan to turn mobile phones into blood and urine analyzers to help people in india manage diabetes and other chronic diseases and to combat poverty and womens illiteracy in pakistan by enabling girls to earn more income in school than they would in traditional jobs i was also struck by how much had changed in a quarter of a century i am heartened and encouraged and even a little surprised by the degree to which millennials have embraced social entrepreneurship as a calling and a career path i was also struck by how the very structure of service has changed over the years of the  finalists 0 percent plan to launch forprofits 0 percent will launch nonprofits and 0 percent will deploy a hybrid model this focus on forprofit endeavors with a social mission is one of the things that distinguish todays social enterprise from yesterdays charity  even though they might have similar goals so what has changed over the past  years to bring about this new era of social entrepreneurship i believe it comes down to three things first todays social entrepreneurs are businesssavvy as evidenced by the growing number of forprofit enterprises its not uncommon to see college and graduate students reading the wall street journal even if their studies are focused on political science medicine or public policy business methods are no longer a discrete pursuit for a subset of students they form part of an essential toolkit in many disciplines second social entrepreneurs are holistic thinkers who want to dissolve the walls that have traditionally separated government business and the nonprofit sector they believe an integrated approach  which is core to social entrepreneurial methodology  has the best chance of success one great example of the synergy that can result is hot bread kitchen founder jessamyn waldman an echoing green fellow wanted to help immigrant women build skills and make a living she started hot bread kitchen which has grown from a single product to a line of ethnic breads that are sold to restaurants whole foods farmers markets and other outlets its housed at la marqueta a historic cityowned retail market in harlem new york the most critical reason for the rise in social entrepreneurism as a career path however is that millennials and other young people are seeking meaning in their lives and work at echoing green we call this work on purpose a national poll from the higher education research institute at ucla found that more than  percent of incoming freshman believe it is essential or very important to help others in difficulty the highest percentage in  years they also rate working for a cause as a top career objective ranking it even higher than making a lot of money that spirit enlivened all of the finalists ideas what has the path for these and other social entrepreneurs looked like and how can others emulate it drawing from the best practices of our fellows echoing green has developed a framework for developing successful careers with social impact heart  head  hustle the first step for budding social entrepreneurs is to define their heart  the issues ideas and people that move them and make their heart beat faster  as a result of anger sorrow joy or other strong emotion the second step is to assess ones head or skills abilities knowledge and connections a life and career that aligns heart and head leads to what we call hustle this refers to those times when a person is completely engaged and committed losing track of time and singularly focused they are doing the work theyd do for free even when they get paid for it why because they are driven by something extraordinary their personal purpose we are at a critical time in the history of our planet and the challenges we face are often daunting but i am more optimistic now than ive ever been more smart young entrepreneurs are eager to take on the challenges more of us believe in the importance of supporting their efforts and everyone is striving to help young people create careers and lives that are both right for them and good for the world david c hodgson cofounder and board chairman of echoing green and managing director at general
