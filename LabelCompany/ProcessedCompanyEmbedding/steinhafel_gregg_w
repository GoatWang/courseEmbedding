the company in february  steinhafel also sits on a variety of boards including business roundtablethe retail industry leaders association the minnesota business partnership the museum council for the smithsonians national museum of african american history and culture and treehouse which is a nonprofit organization that supports atrisk teens challenge discussion steinhafel takes part in the practice of business he reached a standard of excellence when he was named chief executive officer of target corporation in may  a ceo is the highestranking corporate executive and the person in charge of the total management of an organization steinhafel was named a chairman the main decision maker and the president of the entire target corporation he is in charge of more than  employees and must provide the public shareholders with a transparent company as chief executive officer he is responsible for determining the strategy and clearly articulating priorities to execute effective and ensure continued success for target corporation large companies hold a great deal of power in the community and in the national economy they control a large variety of assets and may have billions in

to how our guests want to shop we remain focused on our legacy of giving and service and our commitment to strong healthy and safe communities and in today’s era of unprecedented transparency around pricing and merchandising strategies we believe it’s also important to be transparent in reporting our goals and progress around corporate responsibility” steinhafel with the leadership of gregg steinhafel target corporation leverages their business strengths in order to meet the challenges associated with their determined goals these goals aim to benefit both the company and the communities they serve target has been increasingly responding to the needs of these communities “we continued to advance our commitment to responsible sourcing and environmental sustainability in  by ending the harmful practice of sandblasting denim working with our porkproduct vendors to ban sowgestation crates by  committing to increase our organic food selection by  percent by the end of  and making progress toward our goals of offering a percent sustainable seafood selection in our stores and reducing waste water and greenhouse gas emissions by the end of  additionally we are working to cut excess miles from our us supply chain limit packaging waste and help our guests increase their use of reusable shopping bags which has reduced plasticbag consumption in our stores over the past four years” steinhafel target was presented with a series of obstacles after the economic crisis began in  shoppers became more frugal and competitors such as walmart started to attack the companys core merchandising business since  target has given  percent of its income to nonprofit organizations that support the communities where the corporation does business with dipping sales figures steinhafel continued his processors promise of donating  of the company’s earnings to charity this is significant in more ways than one firstly this is a large contribution from a mainstream multinational corporation in a down economy secondly target corporation is keeping a promise it made to the economy as a whole it has been over  years since this promise was made and the company is still pursuing an effort to support the communities they are involved with steinhafel exhibits both leadership skills and ethical traits by acting as ceo in a strenuous marketplace and yet continuing to help the community despite his efforts to build a strong relationship with the community however steinhafel has faced some challenges target had made a donation to mn forward a group who was in support of republican tom emmers bid for governor emmer is a known antigay conservative the contributions to mn forward prompted an attack from democrats and gay rights groups who called for boycotts of the company’s stores this was a personal challenge for steinhafel because his leadership and moral code were put into question rather than defending his decisions however steinhafel took responsibility for his actions he admitted his mistake and reaffirmed the company’s longstanding support for gay rights steinhafel also wrote a letter to target employees stating that the purpose of his  donation was to support economic growth and job creation he made a poor decision both ethically and financially though this donation he supported a party that is against gay marriage and he lost the gay friendly title of his store however being a strong leader he apologized and admitted his mistake some leaders try to fix their mistakes by lying or being deceptive about the underlying causes of the decision steinhafel admitted wrong wrote we rarely endorse all advocated positions of the organizations or candidates we support and we do not have a political or social agendaas you know target has a history of supporting organizations and candidates on both sides of the aisle who seek to advance policies aligned with our business objectives such as job creation and economic growthlet me be very clear targets support of the glbt community is unwavering and inclusiveness remains a core value of our company with all these challenges arising target has never lost sight of pleasing its customers nor wavered in its commitment to give  of earnings to philanthropic causes target was also able to create  jobs in minnesota in the last  years for ceos there will always be many challenges to overcome after business scandals like enron arthur andersen and worldcom the corporate world today is in need of ethical business leaders through making considerate executive decisions gregg steinhafel is one of the most ethical ceos in corporate america today he has sustained value for the customers employees shareholders and even the community steinhafel is responsible for targets strong brand recognition devotion to innovation strong supply chain initiatives and disciplined approach to managing its business and investing in future growth furthermore he contributes executive decisionmaking skills and valuable strategic planning expertise as well as significant and relevant knowledge of public company requirements and issues target corporation awards  recognition virtue discussion integrity steinhafel practiced having good integrity by upholding his moral values during the recession with dipping sales figures he could have easily cut wages downsized or even falsified financial data that would have affected shareholders and employees instead he held true to his community and organization and kept merchandise prices low unlike his competitors by contributing  of income to donations he continued upholding the company tradition that could have easily been stopped due to financial issues choiceworthy good steinhafel could have easily been like other unethical ceos and could have been selfish instead he cared about his organization and the community and helped build a strong relationship between the two steinhafel demonstrates the choiceworthy good of being a partner of the community as a ceo of any organzation there is a large amount of monetary value that comes with it with this said steinhafel could have left the organziation and still could have been financially stable the rest of his life he also could have taken part in less ethical practices in order to gain more income instead steinhafel makes decisions based on both the needs of his company and the common good it is through these decisions that he fights against the cultural ill of unethical business practices made by multinational corporations bibliography business gregg steinhafel has

many other product operations such as the online service      in january  the target corporation took its first step in expanding outside of the united states with the purchase of  zellers store in canada the plan is to convert  of these stores by  or  in hopes that canadas revenue will be similar to those of the united states     walmart and similar corporations are becoming more and more of a competitor target has always stood by their values and product thus building a great one on one relationship with the customer and expanding their number of traffic with the constant competition of other companies target had come up with several great marketing objectives with the hopes of out pacing the competitors target has now started redcard promotions with its credit card program which will hopefully increase its revenue however raising commodity prices may offset the many gains target may get     producttarget has a clear understanding of the needs of a large retailer target is constantly looking for ways to improve its product and services as well as always meeting the customers needs this may happen by using several different manufacturer for products to avoid any issue with production or by always looking for ways to show the customer that they stand by their code of business and uphold high expectations     priceall of targets products are offered at a lower price and of better quality than most competitors     placethere are several target locations accessible in the united states and many more to come in canada all target customers can access a target store within a few minutes drive or as quick as a click of a mouse for everyones convenience     promotiontarget is famous for using television marketing to compare their variety of product and value of product to those of competitors target also utilizes many billboards in the higher populated cities across the united states many of the corporate stores across the united states use the big target symbol as marketing material to distinguish their corporations     target plans to keep the momentum going with expanding the corporation overseas and continually making the customer a priority target is also moving towards keeping the positive values alive and always coaching team members of the expectation these strategies will help target continue to move in the right direction and make it extremely hard for competitors to catch up     targets budget is strictly managed and watched closely targets market cap as of october   is  billion which is the highest it has been since  target has been and continues to grow an expand at a rapid rate and will continue to do so as their company expands httpwwwwikinvestcomstocktargettgthttpychartscomcompaniestgtmarketcap comments sign inrecent

disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view target’s ceo please stfu about our antigay donations  queerty gurl shut up target’s ceo please stfu about our antigay donations by daniel villarreal june   at pm gregg steinhafel’s  million salary isn’t enough for the target ceo to put up with your annoyingass questions about his company’s donations to a minnesota antigay candidate when repeatedly asked about their antigay endorsement during this week’s annual shareholders meeting steinhafel said “does anybody have a question relating to our business that is unrelated to political giving i would love to hear any question related to something else” then when asked about their stance on minnesota’s ballot amendment banning samesex marriage he said “our position at this particular time is that we are going to be neutral on that particular issue as we would be on other social issues that have polarizing points of view” neutral how very swiss is neutrality even possible in a nationwide civil rights battle could any business or person stay neutral during the civil rights movement of the s either you think all races should be equal or you don’t—the same goes for queers so… target won’t be making any political donations then to any candidates ever again so as not to endorse pro or antigay political stances right and target doesn’t care if its gaycoupled employees get financially screwed during tax season just so long as they purport to be prolgbt by providing benefits to their queer employees under their own roofs right how very moderate how very pronothing how very… neutral get queerty daily subscribe to queerty for a daily dose of politics greggsteinhafel minnesota stories and more  comments cam neutral isn’t neutral if you are staying neutral on a civil rights issue then you are opposed as for him not wanting to answer questions…i find it interesting that this ceo feels he shouldn’t have to answer for a decision that he himself made how terrible that he is being questioned for his bigotry steve this is so not a big deal let it go target is a responsible company that does a lot of good for various communities i agree with steinhafel stfu already mac mcneill steve either you’re straight or you just don’t give a crap about gay rights personally until target mades a donation to gay rights for the same amount they donated to the loset then i’ll gladly and “gayly” shop somewhere else and i’ll stfu but they won’t see a dime from me plaintom steve giving money to people who oppose my equal rights is a big deal to me i am not going to spend my money in an establishment that does not grant me simple respect jamesl there was some poor judgment with their donation — if nothing else the donation wasn’t wellresearched but it was just k and it only happened one time it’d be one thing if target was being consistently irresponsible in their philanthropy efforts and didn’t actively embrace diversity but because target has a strong record of donating to various positive causes totaling hundreds of millions of dollars i think it’s time to let the issue go sure you can hang onto the kneejerk reaction of being horrified especially if all you care about centers on gay rights but at least acknowledge their strong points allen d target can continue to fuck itself i haven’t shopped there since the original donation came to light used to shop there all the time fuck this guy tinkerbell jamesl if i don’t care about anything but gay rights i care about my life i am stripped of first class citizenry based solely on the fact that i am gay we are denied so much simply because of who we are the rest i have worked for with my education but some things we can’t overcome by profession j steve take your own advice and stfu stacy i have boycotted walmart for years for lots of reasons and target over this so thank goodness kmart owned by sears gets high marks from the hrc jeffree it’s easy to overlook that people at the shareholders’ meeting did grill him on the issue whoever asked those questions deserves our thanks because those meetings don’t always get that kind of vocal participation ceodude’s stance on “neutrality” is a twofaced lie because the co’s actions haven’t been neutral biggayinc seems to have dropped the ball here or i am i missing something rainfish jamesl no jamesl i do not care only about “gay rights” i do however care very much for human rights and since gays are human then i make that also my top priority if gingerphobia fearanimus of redheaded people got every hater and every political exploiter of hate all worked up enough to pass vile legal prohibitions relating to job protections and marital rights against redheaded people i would not support businesses nor politicians who did not fully embrace the unimpeachable constitutional right of redheaded people to be treated without exception as coequals in society if target remains “neutral” on human rights out of some misplaced fear of alienating toothless bigots who don’t shop there anyway then i suggest that they really don’t know much about the majority of their customer base perhaps they think they are now walmart maybe if so then lose the phony edgey genx commercial propaganda and adopt the walmartism style of just pushing adult diapers polygrip bengay and chinese slave labor plastic goods accouterments and attire while we all know but hate to admit that target is not much better than walmart in regards to pushing jobstealing offshore foreign products at least they tried to make us believe they took the spam out of the can first before putting it on the dinning room table but class like corporate integrity is often just a selfserving charade still one might expect that target could at least pretend to like us a little while they’re screwing us out of a good portion of our weekly paychecks instead they demand we overlook their infidelity and then they act all dismissive when we don’t target has lost their cool factor i doubt that they will ever get it back has anyone else noticed the demise of those kitschy commercials with the red and white little snacks of mancandy that target used to incorporate in their tv adverts i guess they realized that ambiguously gay market ploys are a waste of airtime for now yesterday coors today target — who else will be on the losing side of history alex i unfortunately work at target i’m not sure how much of my experiences relate to work in general because it’s only my second retail job but i do have some things to say while there is one mildly flamboyant gay guy on the team better described as high maintenance lol my impression is that the work environment is very conformistrewarding and individualitysuppressing…at least from the higher ups it starts with a strict dress code red top tan khaki pants belt for men plain shoes individuals seem cheery but when i try to talk about my interests no one really gives a shit most just feel comfortable talking about the work and i think that says a lot it makes me feel like i sold out the work robotic i’ve got  bosses and each has a different team leader “style” aka no consistency they expect more from their employees and pay less on paper they want us to take two breaks per x hours not counting lunch but there is a lot of pressure to not take breaks and get the work done for example tonight i worked  hours and got one break near the end we have to ask for breaks i have been on my feet for hours “zoning” before and been denied a break until i finish a big section of the store they keep mostly everyone part time under  hours so that they don’t have to give health benefitsinsurance now they want me and other team members to sign up for some charity to garnish my wages when i hardly make anything to begin with hr i don’t know of any fulltime general team members they are actively competing with walmart and redesigning store layouts as a result most of the nonexpendable products like furniture dishware home decor…it feels like low quality but that’s not it…it’s that none of it has any personality if you buy this mass produced stuff you become a mass produced person on the conveyor belt of life please shop somewhere else and support small business online and offline look that much harder to find a unique piece of furniture or decor for your home buy groceries at local grocery stores buy hardware and home improvement stuff from hardware stores buy furniture from furniture stores or thrift stores flea markets craigslist or garage sales don’t buy it from target or other madeinchina stores alex i should also add that when us new target hires were watching training videos they had us watch one that was basically all about why unions are bad – cleverly disguised as being against a pending piece of legislation that would give employees power to unionize with simple majority the thing is though…the video had nothing good to say about unions period there was emphasis on union rules preventing colleagues from different departments from working together on the same tasks “i’d love to help you lift that but the new union rules don’t let me work in the warehouse at all” the ending video message was something like “i want the power to choose whether to unionize or not i want my voice to be heard and this bill would take that away” all a bunch of buzzwords glossing over the fact that no target employees are unionized at this time just another thing i found very telling of target’s values – the bottom line roman target steinhafel and other executives at the top have given generously to the most rabid antigay industry leaders and politicians who are hell bent on passing every antigay law they can possibly shove down all of our throats cam steve steve the donation went to a guy with ties to a group that says countries where gays are killed are more moral than america when asked to apologize or promise not to donate more to that guy the target ceo refused until pressured then he said it wouldn’t happen again and made another donation if they had donated to a group that said women shouldn’t have the right to vote would anybody be telling women that it was “no big deal” and yet we are supposed to think it’s no big deal that they donated to a guy with ties to a group believing that gays should be murdered stevec the donations to these extreme right wing bigots by the target board continue greeg steinhafel and his henchmen on the target board now donate to extreme bigots in the form of personal donations to avoid linking the donations to target make no mistake target is a grossly homophobic organisation – they ‘inclusiveness’ is merely empty pr boyoctt target shop locally map roman thank you for pointing out the fact that the emmer donation of k turned out to only be the tip of the iceberg for target and their executives pattern of donations to politicians like michelle bachman who think that all of us are expendable human garbage i too haven’t shopped target since the emmer donation came to light–and i started shopping less overall and as alex suggested shopping far more locally my life is less cluttered wallet less light and my house smells a lot less like made in china plastic shannon yeah not believing and not going back target and chik fil a are at the very top of my no go list the crustybastard tuck farget pickles target seems to sell things we need or justify or think we need but we don’t i shop basically for a living i spend money for projects for companies before the emmers bullshit donation i spent according to my amex between   a year at target since then zero there is a simple act to walking the walk do it there is no way i’ll spend a dime there again period and as essentially a professional shopper it hasn’t been hard at all use less avoid the assholes and spend your dollars places where they don’t actively work to hate you it’s pretty simple and deeply satisfying i am very grateful that the person or people who had the guts to bring it up again at the shareholders meeting did that’s the way to make change anyone want to check in with gold’s gym gregger jamesl helloooooooooooooooooooo this piece of shit also was going to donate monies to progay causes and backed out his company and their antigay horseshit was bad enough that gaga

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
