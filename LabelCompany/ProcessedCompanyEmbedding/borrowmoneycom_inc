loans unsecured vs secured faq articles what is a unsecured loan a unsecured loan is issued based on the borrowers creditworthiness instead of some type of collateral an unsecured loan can be obtained without the use of property as collateral for processing the loan borrowers generally must have high credit ratings to be approved for an unsecured loan unsecured loans also called personal loans or signature loans involve borrowing money without putting up any collateral because there is no home or car to repossess if you dont make your payments these loans are considerably riskier for lenders extra risk means lenders must charge higher interest rates and require higher credit scores unsecured personal loans involve much less paperwork than secured loans like mortgages but more than products like payday advances the terms are generally shorter from two to five years and loan amounts are usually smaller unsecured loans can be used for almost anything  like debt consolidation college tuition medical bills a business loan or the trip of a lifetime its not easy to get approved for an unsecured loan with bad credit and the rates for these loans are quite high however some lenders might offer you a better deal if you have a cosigner   who should consider a unsecured personal loan consumers who need money quickly should consider an unsecured personal loan what makes a unsecured loan unique is that no collateral is required  the loan is guaranteed only by the borrowers promise to pay these loans might be the only option for people who dont own homes or have sufficient equity to borrow against their homes loan proceeds can be used for almost anything  debt consolidation  college tuition  home improvements  down payments on property  business expenses  vehicles   advantages of unsecured loans for those who need money quickly it can be much faster to apply for a unsecured loan than to sell assets to get the needed cash  and borrowers can always sell their assets later and use the proceeds to pay off the loan if the choices are withdrawing from a retirement account racking up taxes and penalties or applying for an unsecured loan the loan is likely to be the cheaper alternative unlike credit cards fixedrate loans come with interest rates that dont change and there is no default rate for being late with a payment if the consumer experiences a financial disaster at a later date the unsecured loan can be discharged in a chapter  bankruptcy unlike secured loans or governmentbacked student loans   how to apply for a unsecured personal loan because the loan is not backed by anything other than the borrowers promise to repay an applicants credit history and scores are very important applicants for unsecured loans must complete an application authorize a credit check and provide documentation showing that they have sufficient income to repay the new loan  usually pay stubs and w forms or tax returns for the selfemployed underwriting is completed by automated systems and human underwriters and the applicant is notified in writing of the decision to approve or decline the loan in many cases consumers can apply online and have the money transferred directly into their bank accounts without leaving their homes   shopping for unsecured loans unsecured personal loans can be obtained from banks credit unions finance companies pp lenders and others interest rates for these loans vary widely so it makes sense to get quotes from several competing lenders before making any commitments when shopping for the best unsecured personal loan consumers should compare the interest rate fees and apr they should look for prepayment penalties and automatic rollovers and double check the loans term and payment before signing   borrower beware one requirement of most lenders is good credit  applicants with a history of missed payments collections and chargeoffs arent the most promising candidates for unsecured financing there are reputable providers of personal unsecured loans online for people with credit scores under  and other lenders are sometimes willing to fund loans to subprime applicants if they have a cosigner however the internet is also full of shady firms ready to exploit desperate people those seeking an loan should watch out for lenders advertising personal loans for bad credit or unsecured loans with no credit check  these are not really personal loans they are really payday loans check advance loans or title loans  with very short terms and very high interest rates   unsecured personal loan interest rates and terms terms typically range from two to five years the borrower receives a lump sum and repays the loan with equal monthly installments unsecured loan interest rates are usually fixed however there are also revolving lines of credit which function like credit cards borrowers set them up and draw on them as needed paying interest only on the amounts used the monthly payment is based on the loan balance and interest rate which is variable interest rates on unsecured loans the legitimate kind vary according to the lenders policies and the credit ratings of the borrowers in  rates for loans range from  percent at the low end to about  percent at the high end unsecured vs secured personal loans loans fall into two categories – unsecured or secured there are benefits and drawbacks to both but the biggest difference lies in whether the loan requires collateral unsecured personal loans  does not require putting property or assets up as collateral  collateral is an item or items put up as security for the loan meaning it can be seized if you default on the loan  often requires higher credit and has higher interest rates while offering lower borrowing limits  getting an unsecured loan is mostly based on your creditworthiness  types of unsecured loans include most personal loans student loans and credit cards secured personal loans  requires putting up property or assets up as collateral which may be seized if you default on the loan the asset you are taking the loan for is often the collateral for the loan  for example if you are getting a mortgage the house you are buying is the collateral  offers higher loan limits and are easier to get than unsecured loans because the lender takes on less risk if you default  if you cannot get an unsecured loan it may be easier to be approved for a secured loan with collateral  types of secured loans include car loans mortgages and heloc frequently asked questions

bankers to open their pockets you have to know their language heres a primer on the ways banks lend money by joan g ford write a comment credit bankers even those who are hot on the trail of new clients play by some pretty conservative rules they may take you to lunch tour your offices peruse your financials enthusiastically and then turn down a loan request for reasons that seem absurdly technicalin fact banks want to lend money its the main product they have to sell and small business is repidly becoming one of bankings most attractive customers see special report banking in the s inc november but lending officers arent standing at the door counting out bills they still have to cope with both federal and state banking regulations traditional lending standards and a persistent desire to keep the funds they lend from straying beyond their controlthe starting point to overcoming these obstacles most lending officers agree is to put together a proposal that fits into the conventional categories the banking world uses to describe most loans there will still be countless variations on these categories as well as individual terms and conditions to deal with for each borrower but at least youll be speaking a language your banker respects  and that cant hurthere then are the  basic loan categories that bankers generally use to classify loans grouped according to the expected duration of the loanshortterm loansbusiness runs on shortterm loans technically a short term loan means less than a year but in practice often expands to two or three years small companies usually seek shortterm loans to finance receivables or inventory especially in seasonal or perishable lines but shortterm loans can also be turned to many other purposes from taking advantage of an inventory bargain to taking care of an emergencymost shortterm loans fall into one of five classes line of credit a widely used mode of shortterm lending a line of credit consists of a specific sum marked off for a company to draw on as needed over a prescribed period the period may run only  days or may stretch to two years since repayment is tied to anticipated receipts interest is computed only on the amount actually drawn but a commitment fee of  to  of the total credit line is usually imposed to pay the bank for reserving funds that may not be tapped some banks waive the fee in favor of a compensating balance a sum that must be kept on deposit throughout the loan period others work out a combination of compensating balances and commitment feeslines of credit are popular because of their simplicity but banks have developed several credit line arrangements that fit different borrowing needs the cheapest the nonbinding line of credit may be your best buy if youre willing to risk the lines drying up with no guarantees your credit may be curtailed if your companys financial position deteriorates or even if your industry seems healed for hard times moreover when the economy is tight  and your need is greatest  the bank may develop liquidity problems that force a cutoff although the larger moneycenter institutions can usually ride out such crisesthe risks of losing the line can be avoided by paying a premium to insert the word committed in the loan agreement the commitment fee will probably double going as high as  but youre assured that the funds will be there when you need themnonbinding or committed a shortterm line of credit must be cleaned up periodically under most banks rules you must be out of the bank or fully paid up for  days a year in the typical agreementif cleaning up a line of credit will constrict your cash flow theres a third form that may be useful  the revolving line of credit which requires an annual review and renewal but no cleanup this is similar to a revolving charge account as you withdraw funds your available credit diminishes and as you repay it expands by a like amount interest is computed only on the funds actually borrowed and theres usually no additional costordinarily revolving lines are repaid in monthly installments of interest plus principal but some banks offer other optionsat citibank in new york for example you can arrange to restrict some installments to interest holding off on payments of principal until your cash flow improves inventory loan when a small company with seasonal borrowing needs comes in for a loan of  to  some big banks shy away from the formal line of credit preferring to write what they may call shortterm loans to carry inventory the banks collateral is the inventory itself  sometimes under an arrangement called floor planning that bigticket retailers use loans are collateralized by specific inventory items  so your banker is likely to feel in control of the situation from the customers point of view however an inventory loan might just as well be a line of credit funds are made available to be taken down or borrowed as needed repayment is made in installments as inventory is sold and receivables satisfiedthe usual inventory loan runs six to nine months and requires the same day annual cleanup as a line of credit if you want an extension commercial loan some big banks funnel much of their shortterm lending into commercial or time loans which minimize bookkeeping for both lender and borrower requiring no installments a commercial loan is simply repaid in a lump sum at the end of the term typically three to six months in practice commercial loans are often used to finance inventory but they may be applied to any other purpose that wins bank approval in making a commercial loan the banks chief concern in addition to the companys credit rating is the source of repayment how will the company amass the lump sum to meet its obligation accounts receivable financing small companies in almost every industry today find receivables are tying up inordinate amounts of working capital so theyre turning to their banks for loans that will convert unpaid accounts into fast cashwhich accounts and how muchgenerally accounts must be less than  days past due and the customers themselves must qualify as creditworthy for receivables meeting these criteria banks will advance  to  of face value repayable as customers checks come in the usual arrangement calls for you to pass the checks on to the bank which takes its portion and deposits the rest in your account charging interest only on the amount outstandingalthough the contract is ordinarily written for one year many banks are prepared to work out a revolving format under such an agreement which is subject to annual review and renewal they will continue to advance funds against your incoming receivables one limitation on receivables financing that doesnt apply to other shortterm loans is that most banks set minimums based on the cost of monitoring such loans at the southeast first national bank of miami for example qualified receivables must amount to at least  which translates into annual sales of at least  million factoring perhaps the oldest method of commercial lending factoring is a variation of accounts receivable financing in which the bank or a factoring company buys receivables outright a couple of decades ago factoring was largely restricted to the apparel and textiles industries and was disdained in other quarters today many more industries draw on factoring services in addition to textiles major users include the electronics importing wood and wood products plastics home furnishings and appliance industriessince receivables are purchased without recourse ordinarily youre no longer involved once the transaction is completed the bank assumes credit risks and takes on collection responsibilities receiving payments directly from your customers but if you dont want your customers but if you dont want your customers to know youre involved in a factoring arrangement you have other options some banks offer nonnotification factoring in which you continue to collect payments on the purchased receivables and forward them to the new ownerthere are some limits to factoring the bank subjects receivables to rigid scrutiny before making any purchases to screen out the poorest risks further your costs in the form of discounts from face value may be quite high often in fact they are higher than in most other forms of shortterm financingmediumterm loansshortterm loans tend to be granted by banks without too much concern for collateral since these loans are usually selfliquidating from sales made in the ordinary course of business operations more likely to require collateral are mediumterm loans of one to five years which are the usual way to finance machinery and equipment including furniture and fixtures plant alteration and expansion while you may view the asset youre purchasing as security dont be surprised if the bank doesnt see it that way and asks for additional collateral particularly if youre starting a new company the bank will however expect the asset to serve as the source of repayment in terms of generating increased revenuesthere are two kinds of mediumterm loans term loan most term loans providing  to  of total costs are written either for five years with a refinancing clause or for the useful life of the asset the typical repayment schedule calls for quarterly installments of principal plus interest principal payments remain constant but interest computed on the amount outstanding declines over the term of the loan in consequence installments are highest at the start although you can often arrange to tailor the repayment schedule to meet your anticipated cash flow monthly payment business loan even with this deferral the quarterly installments may prove initially burdensome accordingly some banks offer a variation permitting you to make approximately equal monthly payments over the entire period at union trust in new haven conn for example you can work out a schedule tailored to your companys needs that will allow you to repay a much smaller amount in the first year or two than would be demanded by termloan conditions toward the end of the loan period though youll be paying more under the monthly payment plan while these payments remain the same the quarterly termloan installments decrease as interest drops along with principal owedmany companies find the reduced early payments advantageous but whichever method of repayment suits you better you should be aware that mediumterm loans in contrast to shortterm loans may impose operating restrictions on your company the bank may insist on your maintaining a certain level of working capital or current ratio current assetscurrent liabilities or limits may be enforced on the distribution of dividends or on other debt if you dont like the conditions laid down by one bank however try another youre sure to find differenceslongterm loansloans of five or more years least often sought and probably the hardest to get will be linked to specific business purposes the most common include purchase of real property major expansion acquisitions and startups commercial and industrial mortgages banks ask sharp questions about potential real estate purchases because as a bank of america lending officer cautions pride of ownership can mean business failure nevertheless if you get the chance to buy the building youre now renting most banks will consider a mortgage loan of up to  of appraised value commercial and industrial mortgages may be written in a variety of ways depending on the value of the building your companys longrange profit projections and the banks lending policies under the best circumstances you might get a year mortgage to be paid off in regular monthly installments more likely though youll have to settle for a mortgage of  to  years but your monthly payments probably wont reflect this short period rather theyll be geared to a  or year amortization periodwhen the mortgage comes due youll be faced with a balloon payment of the entire amount still owed many companies manage to refinance at this point but a new loan wont be guaranteed real estate loan many companies face just the opposite problem they already own real estate and want to borrow against its value to finance an acquisition or other form of expansion you can tap this equity without giving up a lowinterest first mortgage by adding a second mortgage  if you have sufficient equity and good financial standing if youre in a less solid position a wraparound mortgage could be an alternative this differs from a second mortgage in one detail the bank tightens its control by receiving all your mortgage payments and then passing on the amount due to the holder of the first mortgageif your mortgaged property has appreciated substantially you might consider refinancing you can probably get a new mortgage based on current value but youll have to give up your old interest rate and take on todays higher rate your banker may try to discourage you from refinancing  unless youre certain you can turn the cash you get into longterm profits personal loan most bankers believe an owners personal assets should provide much of the financing for major expansion and acquisition so you may have to think about including a secured personal loan in your longterm financing plans any property in your own name can be used as collateral along with marketable securities savings passbooks and certificates of deposit such collateral is readily acceptable and a personal loan may be easier to negotiate than a business loanto help you put the proceeds to most productive use the bank may recommend a sophisticated leveraging technique for example you may be advised to turn the funds over to your company as a subordinated loan repayable to you only after other company debt is discharged while this kind of loan doesnt create real equity it will appear on your balance sheet as surplus capital a source of leveraging further loans up to three times the amount of the surplus assetbased loan long used by big corporations but new to the repertory of small companies is the leveraged buyout in which the target companys own assets are used to finance the takeover virtually every asset can be used  receivables raw materials inventory machinery and equipment under the most favorable conditions a combination of these assets may generate as much as  of the acquisition cost but youll be charged the prime or base rate as some banks are starting to call this benchmark figure plus  or  moreover the bank is likely to insist on various operating restrictions as well as keep close tabs on the assets but once again not all banks make the same demands so you can shop around for the best deal startup loan starting up parallels expansion and acquisition in the banks view which means that youll have to pour much of your own money into the project in addition to funds raised by personal loans and partners investments you may be able to get a term loan from the banks venture capital specialists though a small business administration guarantee which protects  of the total is frequently a condition this procedure can involve a fair amount of paperwork and delay unless your bank participates in the sbas certification program about  of the nations approximately  commercial banks

disclosures unsecured personal loans unsecured vs secured faq articles what is a unsecured loan a unsecured loan is issued based on the borrowers creditworthiness instead of some type of collateral an unsecured loan can be obtained without the use of property as collateral for processing the loan borrowers generally must have high credit ratings to be approved for an unsecured loan unsecured loans also called personal loans or signature loans involve borrowing money without putting up any collateral because there is no home or car to repossess if you dont make your payments these loans are considerably riskier for lenders extra risk means lenders must charge higher interest rates and require higher credit scores unsecured personal loans involve much less paperwork than secured loans like mortgages but more than products like payday advances the terms are generally shorter from two to five years and loan amounts are usually smaller unsecured loans can be used for almost anything  like debt consolidation college tuition medical bills a business loan or the trip of a lifetime its not easy to get approved for an unsecured loan with bad credit and the rates for these loans are quite high however some lenders might offer you a better deal if you have a cosigner   who should consider a unsecured personal loan consumers who need money quickly should consider an unsecured personal loan what makes a unsecured loan unique is that no collateral is required  the loan is guaranteed only by the borrowers promise to pay these loans might be the only option for people who dont own homes or have sufficient equity to borrow against their homes loan proceeds can be used for almost anything  debt consolidation  college tuition  home improvements  down payments on property  business expenses  vehicles   advantages of unsecured loans for those who need money quickly it can be much faster to apply for a unsecured loan than to sell assets to get the needed cash  and borrowers can always sell their assets later and use the proceeds to pay off the loan if the choices are withdrawing from a retirement account racking up taxes and penalties or applying for an unsecured loan the loan is likely to be the cheaper alternative unlike credit cards fixedrate loans come with interest rates that dont change and there is no default rate for being late with a payment if the consumer experiences a financial disaster at a later date the unsecured loan can be discharged in a chapter  bankruptcy unlike secured loans or governmentbacked student loans   how to apply for a unsecured personal loan because the loan is not backed by anything other than the borrowers promise to repay an applicants credit history and scores are very important applicants for unsecured loans must complete an application authorize a credit check and provide documentation showing that they have sufficient income to repay the new loan  usually pay stubs and w forms or tax returns for the selfemployed underwriting is completed by automated systems and human underwriters and the applicant is notified in writing of the decision to approve or decline the loan in many cases consumers can apply online and have the money transferred directly into their bank accounts without leaving their homes   shopping for unsecured loans unsecured personal loans can be obtained from banks credit unions finance companies pp lenders and others interest rates for these loans vary widely so it makes sense to get quotes from several competing lenders before making any commitments when shopping for the best unsecured personal loan consumers should compare the interest rate fees and apr they should look for prepayment penalties and automatic rollovers and double check the loans term and payment before signing   borrower beware one requirement of most lenders is good credit  applicants with a history of missed payments collections and chargeoffs arent the most promising candidates for unsecured financing there are reputable providers of personal unsecured loans online for people with credit scores under  and other lenders are sometimes willing to fund loans to subprime applicants if they have a cosigner however the internet is also full of shady firms ready to exploit desperate people those seeking an loan should watch out for lenders advertising personal loans for bad credit or unsecured loans with no credit check  these are not really personal loans they are really payday loans check advance loans or title loans  with very short terms and very high interest rates   unsecured personal loan interest rates and terms terms typically range from two to five years the borrower receives a lump sum and repays the loan with equal monthly installments unsecured loan interest rates are usually fixed however there are also revolving lines of credit which function like credit cards borrowers set them up and draw on them as needed paying interest only on the amounts used the monthly payment is based on the loan balance and interest rate which is variable interest rates on unsecured loans the legitimate kind vary according to the lenders policies and the credit ratings of the borrowers in  rates for loans range from  percent at the low end to about  percent at the high end unsecured vs secured personal loans loans fall into two categories – unsecured or secured there are benefits and drawbacks to both but the biggest difference lies in whether the loan requires collateral unsecured personal loans  does not require putting property or assets up as collateral  collateral is an item or items put up as security for the loan meaning it can be seized if you default on the loan  often requires higher credit and has higher interest rates while offering lower borrowing limits  getting an unsecured loan is mostly based on your creditworthiness  types of unsecured loans include most personal loans student loans and credit cards secured personal loans  requires putting up property or assets up as collateral which may be seized if you default on the loan the asset you are taking the loan for is often the collateral for the loan  for example if you are getting a mortgage the house you are buying is the collateral  offers higher loan limits and are easier to get than unsecured loans because the lender takes on less risk if you default  if you cannot get an unsecured loan it may be easier to be approved for a secured loan with collateral  types of secured loans include car loans mortgages and heloc frequently asked questions
