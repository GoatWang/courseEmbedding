informationmanager�s letter fellow shareholdersmoney market yields remained low throughout the year ended may   the second half of our fiscal year was notable however because the federal reserve made the first change to its monetary policy in seven years at the december meeting of the federal open market committee the central bank raised its target for shortterm interest rates to a range of  to  from a previous range of  to  since that time the fed has delayed subsequent rate increases due to concerns about global economic weakness given global market uncertainty slowing employment growth and low inflation we believe that future rate increases will be slow in comingeconomy and interest ratesthe us economy expanded over the last year though the headline growth rate has been decelerating with each passing quarter while firstquarter gross domestic product growth in  was measured at a sluggish  rate according to the most recent estimate we believe growth is likely to rebound over the balance of the year the job growth trend has been slowing in recent months but other labor market indicators have been resilient over the last year particularly in the face of unfavorable economic developments overseas the national unemployment rate dropped to  in may a level not seen since late  though a declining labor force served to mute this good newsbroad measures of inflation have been very low due to declining prices of oil and other commodities�which is a plus for consumers and many businesses�but core inflation which excludes food and energy costs is beginning to turn higher when the fed raised shortterm rates in december fed officials acknowledged the strong labor market expressed confidence that inflation will rise to the fed�s  objective and cited the need to be proactive because of the usual lagged response of monetary policy changes due to the slowdown in economic activity and global risks however the central bank has kept rates unchanged thus far in  money market review because of the fed�s december rate increase other money market rates that depend on the fed funds target rate have increased commensurately threemonth libor for example rose from  to  over the last six months higher libor rates allow money funds to invest in debt issued by banks and corporations at more attractive rates interest rates on municipal variable rate securities eventually moved higher too threemonth treasury bill yields rose from  to  over the last six months even with the persistent demand for shortterm highquality assets spurred by new money fund regulations oneyear treasury bill yields began the most recent sixmonth period at  and oscillated in the  to  range before ending the period at  the overwhelming demand for and smaller supply of these highquality

costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the most recent sixmonth period and held for the entire period actual expensesthe first line of the following table actual provides information about actual account values and expenses based on the fund�s actual returns you may use the information on this line together with your account balance to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number on the first line

level  quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly including but not limited to quoted prices for similar financial instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in inactive markets interest rates and yield curves implied volatilities and credit spreads level  � unobservable inputs observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information about actual events or transactions and reflect the assumptions market participants would use to price the financial instrument unobservable inputs are those for which market data are not available and are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use to price the financial instrument gaap requires valuation techniques to maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs input levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with financial instruments at that level but rather the degree of judgment used in determining those values for example securities held by a money market fund are generally high quality and liquid however they are reflected as level  because the inputs used to determine fair value are not quoted prices in an active market in accordance with rule a under the  act each fund values its securities at amortized cost which approximates fair value securities for which amortized cost is deemed not to reflect fair value are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by the valuation committee
