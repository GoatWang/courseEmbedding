lived most of his life at bierley on the outskirts of bradford a district at the heart of yorkshire�s textile industry  he was a member of the first generation of englishmen to take an informed interest in bryophytes he was a contemporary of adam buddle samuel brewer who came to live near richardson samuel doody and william vernon these men corresponded with the older naturalist john ray supplying information for his publications on natural history little is known of richardson�s own bryological career and discoveries however he corresponded with dillenius gronovius petiver sir hans sloane and many other naturalists � a correspondence fortunately preserved and published by his great grand daughter and revealing that richardson occupied an important � even pivotal � role in sustaining interest in botany among contemporary naturalists richardson was sufficiently wealthy not to need to overexert himself professionally and was able to fully indulge his passion for plants by travelling widely in england wales and scotland  he took particular interest in mosses and lichens as well as vascular plants he also developed the gardens at bierley to an extent hitherto unknown in northern england  not confining himself to growing plants of medical interest richardson�s gardens became renowned as rich in both native and foreign plants particularly when a hothouse was built in  exactly how his garden was laid out and its position on the estate is not known  evidently it was large and gave richardson much pleasure  when asked for some specimens by a fellow botanist he complained that the season was rather far advanced but that he would do his best and that he had �set about drying such plants as are still in flower and i think i can preserve for you one hundred and fifty dry specimens that are fair and wellpreserved  if i live to enjoy my garden another year i dare promise you double that number  a new england quaker story throughout the seventeenth century english nantucketers resisted all attempts to establish a church on the island partly because a woman by the name of mary coffin starbuck forbade it  it was said that nothing of consequence was done on nantucket without marys approval  mary coffin and nathaniel starbuck had been the first english couple to be married on the island in  and had established a lucrative outpost for trading with the wampanoag  whenever an itinerant minister came to nantucket looking to establish a congregation he was firmly rebuffed by mary starbuck then in  mary succumbed to a charismatic quaker minister named john richardson  speaking before a group assembled in the starbucks living room richardson succeeded in moving mary to tears  it was mary starbucks conversion to quakerism that established the unique fusion of spirituality and covetousness that would make possible nantuckets rise as a whaling port quakers or more properly members of the society of friends depended on their own experience of gods presence the inner light for guidance rather than relying on a puritan ministers interpretation of scripture  but nantuckets ever growing number of quakers were hardly freethinking individuals  friends were expected to conform to rules of behavior determined during yearly meetings encouraging a sense of community that was as carefully controlled as that of any new england society if there was a difference it was the quaker belief in pacifism and a conscious spurning of worldly ostentationtwo principles that were not intended to interfere in any way with a persons ability to make money  instead of building fancy houses or buying fashionable clothes nantuckets quakers reinvested their profits in the whale fishery  as a result they were able to weather the downturns that laid to waste so many mainland whaling merchants and mary starbucks children along with their macy and coffin cousins quickly established a quaker whaling dynasty   death in mysterious circumstances the rev william richardson had been sent to america by the kirk of scotland to bring christianity to the indian tribes  he spent most of his life travelling in the south carolina backcountry before settling in the waxhaws region  in  he married the daughter of a missionary there  but the marriage produced no children and was by all accounts unhappy in  the reverend was found one morning dead in his study on his knees and with a bridle around his neck  at the time his wife showed great grief and all concluded that it had been an act of religious melancholy  he was thus buried quickly however many knew of the temper of his wife and their acrimonious relationship  somewhat suspiciously it transpired all of the servants had been sent out into the field on the day of his death  it was therefore decided that the corpse should be taken out of the grave and examined  marks of stangulation were found on the neck and bruises on the chest  the conclusion reached was that no man could possibly have destroyed himself in the manner by which the bridle had been placed around the neck  it was in fact more than probable that the bridle had been put there and the body set in a praying position after he had been strangled there the account ends and we have no identification of the guilty party  for the dead man himself there was issue   he had adopted his nephew william richardson davie as a son after the mother had died and oversaw his education  that young man became an american patriot achieving fame and distinction in the war of independence     richard richardson in hiding at the surrender of charleston brigadier richardson and his two sons richard and edward were taken prisoner by the british and sent to a military station on johns island  here the brigadier died and his two sons nearly fell victim to the smallpox however richard was able to make his escape and being disguised by the effects of the disease returned to the neighborhood of his home where he concealed himself in the santee swamp by this time british troops had overrun the state and were occupying the richardson big home plantation  his family were it is said restricted there to a small apartment and allowed only a scanty share of the provisions  nevertheless every day dorcas richardson would send food to her husband in the swamp via an old and faithful negro in whose discretion she could trust sometimes she even ventured to visit him taking their little daughter with her  it was not long before the british had information of richardsons escape they naturally concluded that he was somewhere in the vicinity of his family and relatives  a diligent search was instituted and scouts were sent in every direction  rewards were offered for his apprehension but without success not infrequently did the officers boast in the presence of the wife of what they would do to her husband should they capture him  on one occasion some of the officers displayed their swords reeking with blood  probably that of cattle  and told her that it was the blood of captain richardson whom they had killed  at another time they brought intelligence that he had been taken and hanged  in this state of cruel suspense she sometimes remained for several successive days unable to learn the fate of her husband and not knowing whether to believe or distrust the horrible tales brought to her ears hearing that the british troops had been temporarily ordered away richard did visit his wife at their plantation  however he had been seen on his way by a loyalist  a party of them assembled and were soon to be seen drawn up in front of his house  richard hastily came forth leaped on his steed and galloped up the oaklined avenue avoiding the little firing that was aimed at him all this took place in the sight of his terrified family  afterwards they would describe the danger and his providential escape  his wife dorcas could only account for his escape by conjecturing that the party had determined to take richardson alive and thus claim the reward that had been offered for his capture when peace returned colonel richardson who had been promoted for his services resumed his life as a planter  of he and his wife�s ten children four died young  the rest married and reared families  peggy richardson and the catholic uprising in armagh there were many anxious people waiting for tidings and amongst them was one peggy richardson who on hearing of the plight of the protestants determined to relieve them  she went home and told her mother the state of affairs saying  im going to relieve them the old woman said why child you cannot go you will be killed she replied why mother isnt my father there he is dear and my three brothers they are dear and my husband is there  �he is dear and god helping me ill be there too� so saying she took a strong petticoat and two new pillow slips which she sewed to the headband of a petticoat with strong cord around them forming loops at the top for handles  she then went to the haystack and pulled out sufficient to make a hole large enough to put her little fouryearold girl in tying up a bunch of hay to stuff into the hole late that night she took her little girl and placed her in the haystack with many cautions and then having equipped herself she went to churchill where she got all the ball cartridges she could carry  she then started by the derryhubbert road for the diamond arriving safely about the same time as william blacker at the scene of the conflict  the latter had to traverse a friendly country across portadown bridge to about five to six miles in the direction of loughgall when all at once they came upon the scene of meditated rapine and murder  thomas richardson  a quaker in lombard street from his squaretoed shoes to his low broadbrimmed quaker hat a solidity marks him  here walks a man of substance warm and comfortable without pride but with a due regard for himself  the buttoned gaiters and knee breeches the long collarless coat of broadcloth in quaker plainness the hat of best fur show a simplicity dignity and sureness towards himself and a meek disregard of other opinion by one who could afford to disregard it  he fronts his fellow men without ornament and without disguise confident that they will take him for what he is  in spite of the firm chin and prominent nose a humorous kindness marks his face the eyes  alert and friendly  belong to the man who later knew all the ayton children who liked to ask them to tea at cleveland lodge when the strawberries were ripe and who could see and supply the school needs of � tin pie dishes� or � milking frocks�  thomas richardson was always human business never overwhelmed him as his life went on his shrewdness remained and his kindness of heart mellowed  thomas miles richardson in the northeast his favorite sketching grounds comprised northumberland the borders and scotland  his activities as a writer and illustrator further emphasised his loyalties to the region  he published a volume on the armorial bearings in st andrew�s chapel newcastle and began to work on books about newcastle from  and the castles of the english and scottish borders from  his election in  as an associate of the new society of painters in watercolours based in london seems to have been a temporary deviation from his regional activities and it is perhaps no wonder that he was expelled three years later  the execution of joseph richardson in dumfries it appeared that mkenna and joseph richardson had gone to dublin in august  and with the assistance of a person from whom mkenna knew four years before purchased  notes of the british linen company and got a plate engraved of the guinea note of carrick brown  co of glasgow  in this business they were engaged some two to three weeks and got  of the notes printed  they then returned to scotland where they were apprehended   of the notes were found in the possession of mkennas wife and  in a turf dyke in joseph richardsons yard   a petition had been sent to the fountain of mercy in favour of these unhappy men and an answer was returned with a respite during his majestys pleasure for william richardson only a gentleman who accompanied the clergyman to the jail described minutely the demeanor of all the prisoners on receiving the answer to their petition  william richardson who was first visited appeared  quite uplifted with the communication made to him for a few seconds his colour went and came but the first flutter of the heart being soon ever his breathing became freer and his speech firmer and although he expressed some regret at the fate of his companions his mind was evidently wholly engrossed with the strong instinctive desire of selfpreservation  on the other hand mkenna and joseph richardson apparently received the news of their now irrevocable doom with every feeling becoming their situation  joseph did express a satisfaction that his brothers life was spared since to use his own words the idea of two brothers going out of life in the same awful way was painful to be thought on  on saturday the distracted mother of poor joseph visited him for the last time with the unhappy woman being so overcome by her maternal feelings as to swoon away again and again  tuesday he bade adieu to his sister and a younger brother and took a last leave of his wife who was all night in the cell with him the scaffold was erected in front of the prison in buccleugh street  at an early hour vast multitudes were pouring into the town from the surrounding country to witness the awful scene and long before the appointed hour the crowd was immense  at about three oclock the prisoners ascended the scaffold when the executioner adjusted the fatal cord and after a short time spent in praise and prayer the signal was given and they were ushered into the world that is �unseen  eternal amongst a very general feeling of sympathy from the surrounding multitude  james richardson and the sugar business there were four market days in glasgow leaving wednesday and saturday free to enable the members of the trade to visit greenock and port glasgow the lochgoil steamer by which they travelled left the broomielaw at halfpast seven in the morning and breakfast was served on the passage down and after spending two hours or so in business they generally found their way back to glasgow about two oclock when there was fog the passage was tedious and not without hazard  one sugar man was kept all night off dumbarton in a steamer with little food and inadequate sleeping accommodation  mr richardson generally sat near the funnel enveloped in a blue cloak interesting himself in some book he had brought with him  he was an omnivorous reader  after a drive of about five miles from springhall near rutherglen he glanced hurriedly at his letters which were brought to him before the steamer started and prepared himself for the eventualities of the day whether to sell or buy   aunt sukeys ordeal susan richardson aunt sukey and her children had been brought into illinois territory by her master andrew border  one day her children and those of her master had gotten into an altercation and her mistress had had her children whipped  when sukey objected she was told that she would be subject to a severe lashing herself the thought of being scourged and by a woman too was more than sukey could bear  so hastily and secretly one winter�s night she left with her children and went north following the stars to cairo where she got on the line of the underground railroad reaching knox county but scarcely had aunt sukey and her charges alighted from the wagon that they was arrested and conveyed to knoxville where they were confined to the county jail  notice of her capture was immediately sent south  her master saw the notice hastened to knoxville and grabbed the children  frantic and almost heartbroken the poor mother thought that she must return to the dread scourged life of bondage with her children  but she was advised by sympathizing friends not to go for it would only be to suffer increased pain and mental anxiety as her children would undoubtedly be sold and sent south  instead she boarded a sleigh and sped over the snowy earth to galesburg where she could be safer soon after aunt sukey had settled in galesburg a lawsuit  which became famous  was instituted by her former master andrewborder for her recovery  by some means it was defeated   jonathan richardsons spa in shotley bridge the spring anciently called hally well now shotley spa was at a distant period noted for its efficacy in the cure of scrofulous complaints it fell however into disuse and for a long time no benefit was derived from it till a prevailing tradition lately induced jonathan richardson esq to commence a search upon the spot where it was supposed to exist the search was successful  appropriate buildings a wellroom baths c were erected in the rustic style and mr richardson has opened carriagedrives and promenades upon his estate in the village there are two papermills in operation a market for corn is held weekly and a fair for cattle every half year s bessbrook village bessbrook is a large manufacturing village the population of which is about  � the same number as are employed in mr richardson�s linen manufacturing enterprises there  it is situated in a beautiful and wellwatered valley convenient to the camlough mountains and about three miles from newry  the scenery from the combined effect of hill vale and wood is very attractive  the village is the property of mr john grubb richardson esq who has spared no expense or trouble to make it �the model town� in this he has received the heartiest support from other members of the firm  the place has certain peculiarities  first it is without a public house a feature endorsed by six to one of householders in a recent poll it is also without a pawnbrokers and a police barrack these not being required  bessbrook is remarkable for its yarn and linen manufactories a process from flaxgrowing to the finished product � be it family linen a pocket handkerchief of a table cloth  carried on locally  the firm�s huckabacks towelling fronting linens drills diapers and damasks are known the world over  the damasks made at bessbrook by machinery are easily the equal of those made by hand looms  the company have also extensive quarries where the beautiful blue and grey granite is hewn out dressed and polished for different markets  it is now extensively used in england scotland and america for monumental and other purposes  the religious denominations are well represented  a fine structure is that belonging to the irish church capable of holding   the presbyterians have a commodious church for a similar number  the friends mr richardson himself being a parishioner have a place of worship for  and the wesleyians have a neat chapel  the roman catholic chapel is a spacious edifice  a letter from the quaker elizabeth richardson �in the dark and stormy days which have fallen over the world since august  and in which some have seen their way to testify to convictions which have not been deemed popular i can personally testify that in no quarter did i find such steadfastness of purpose and such a rigid adherence to deep religious convictions as in mrs spence watson in the struggle for liberty of conscience i received great inspiration through her brave and noble spirit nor can i forget how in what were to me very trying days in  when friends were falling rapidly away mrs watson insisted on staying with me during the long hours which preceded the hearing of my claim before the gateshead tribunal the only friend i had in court elizabeth richardson spoke and wrote fearlessly against the first world war  at the passing of the military service act she advised and helped many young men whose punishments and imprisonments she felt most keenly  jimmy richardson and his bagpipes jimmy richardson was twenty years old and a piper in the canadian scottish battalion when he won his victoria cross for gallantry during the first world war on october   his company was held up in the somme by very strong wire and came under intense fire  piper richardson who had obtained permission to play the company �over the top� strode up and down outside the wire playing his pipes  this so inspired the company that the wire was rushed and the position captured  after the rush jimmy turned back to recover his pipes but was never seen again richardsons bagpipes were believed to have been lost in the mud of the somme  however it turned out that a british army chaplain had found the pipes in  and brought them back home after the war to a school in scotland where he was a teacher the pipes were unidentified for several decades and served as a broken mudcaked and bloodstained reminder of an unknown piper from the great war  ninety years later these pipes were identified as those played by piper richardson on that fateful day in  and were repatriated to canada   texas money like much of east texas henderson county is a rolling expanse of pastureland woods and workedout cotton fields  its county seat and cultural capital is a sleepy town with the splendid name of athens pop   henderson county and athens have a distinction that makes them notable even in texas  they have spawned about  of texas millionaires and multimillionaires  the biggest of these big rich are a select few known throughout texas as the new athenians sid richardson the richest of the new athenians because of his ocean of oil reserves jokingly takes credit for starting the boys from athens on their way years ago  when making his first killing in oil richardson drove into town in a blocklong cadillac  when i left he says all of these guys sitting on those benches around the square jumped up and down and followed me out of town a commentator described him as follows he was your classic wildcatter  nobody could estimate not even sid richardson how much money he had  during the hot months of summer he would always spend time in california at a small place in laboya  it was a place that lured an odd collection of people  washington figures such as j edgar hoover and joseph mccarthy hollywood types and mafia people  because it was close to the race track which sid richardson loved richardson and his friend clint murchison hit the front pages when trying to help a fellow texan buy the new york central railroad the story goes that murchison called richardson in california and said i need your help  richardson took the call just when he was starting out for a round of golf  in his haste he agreed to go along on the deal without hearing the details  next day when he spoke to murchison again richardson was startled to find that it was not a  million deal as he thought but a  million one  what the hell did you say was the name of that railroad he exclaimed    tony richardson and a taste of honey tony richardson continued in the vein of kitchensink realism with an adaptation in  of shelagh delaneys novel of workingclass life set in england in the early s a taste of honey starred rita tushingham as the waifish jo a plain yearold girl who is dragged from one shabby bedsitter to another by helen dora bryan her promiscuous alcoholic termagant of a mother when helen and her current lover peter robert stephens take a holiday in blackpool jo goes along and while walking on the beach meets jimmy paul danquah a black sailor on leave  after they spend the night together jimmys ship leaves for points unknown  helen and peter have impulsively decided to marry and they move into his flat leaving jo in the cold  she gets a job in a shoe store where she meets gay and mildmannered geoffrey and the two decide to move into a flat together  jo soon discovers shes carrying jimmys child news that depresses her  but geoffrey couldnt be happier and he begins knitting baby clothes goes to a clinic for childcare instruction and even offers to marry jo this moving film is exceptionally well acted and directed it is a tribute to richardsons boldness in taking on the theme of miscegenation then a much more controversial issue    lady darwins brooch in  widowed and about to move to a new apartment lady darwin approached australia house in london offering an unusual object for repatriation to australia  it was a gold brooch that had belonged to her grandmother  encased in a box labelled flavelle bros sydney she dated it to  about the time that her grandmother fanny richardson had sailed home to britain lady darwin�s great grandfather dr william richardson had arrived in australia on the katharine stewart forbes from scotland in   his daughter fanny was born in   her granddaughter recalled that �she always spoke of her girlhood as having been spent in sydney  and she remembered the long voyage back to britain under sail�  two of her brothers did stay as sheep farmers in new south wales   fanny�s brooch measures  centimetres high and  centimetres across and is notable for the strong sculptural treatment of the spray of leaves tied with a fillet  the botanical motifs are decidedly australian two native woody pear pods and leaves brake and bird�s nest fern fronds a curling lily leaf tied at the base with a fillet and a callistemon or banksia flower  each metal leaf has been cast or cut shaped and carefully engraved to simulate the form and texture of the species  ghosts at richhill castle at seventeen dolly had been acclaimed as the most beautiful girl in all ireland  when she went to visit her aunt lady loftus in dublin she was the object of such admiration that she could not walk in the mall because of the crowd of undesired worshippers   instead she had to rise at  am and take her exercise in st stephens green to ensure some privacy  dolly and william richardson were married in  but sadly she died childless in  warren coates chairman of the northern ireland paranormal research association is leading a group who visit the castle once a fortnight to investigate paranormal activity  tape recordings cameras and highlysensitive instruments that measure humidity air pressure and magnetic fields are being used to detect the presence of spirits �when we set up our equipment we actually got activity over the whole building� warren said  �when you take away things like draughty windows or doors rumbling pipes or floorboards creaking you reach the conclusion that there is a definite presence� gordon little and his wife helen live in part of the castle and are trying to have it restored  �in the  years that the castle has been my family home i have never seen a ghost� gordon said  �my sisterinlaws relatives have though � one of her sisters chatted to the spirit of a lady on the stairs and reckons it was dolly  i tend to resent the fact that people can see things while i live here and i can�t  if they prove there is a ghost here i will accept it�  governor bill richardson and ufos bill richardson the new mexico governor and democratic presidential candidate

prestigious family in oaxaca  he became a planter and rancher in nicaragua and according to the candidates autobiography between worlds fathered children by four different women in mexiico and central

richardson a president for americans of all colors including the little green men despite denials by federal officials many ufo buffs cherish the notion that in  a flying saucer crashed in rural roswell scattering alien bodies and saucer debris across the terrain  in  gov bill richardson wrote in a foreword to a new book the roswell dig diaries that the mystery surrounding this crash has never been adequately explained not by independent investigators nor by the us government richardsons foreword drew scorn from veteran ufo investigators and science popularizers  the grand old man of sceptical ufo investigators philip j kass who has written for aviation week  space technology since  said gov richardson is wrong about roswell and too trusting of tv network promoters  after more
