purchased in  but they work just as well as newfangled ones the colorful flowers on the windowsill are easytomaintain fake and the  chairs mismatched and a bit tattered work out well for large meetings if an office reflects a personality then by most accounts the cramped and cluttered quarters of districtbased wachtel  co on th street nw capture bonnie wachtel perfectly practical unpretentious and some say refreshingly offbeat last week wachtel thrust her small securities brokerage firm into the spotlight when she wrote a public letter detailing what she said were governance lapses at integral systems inc a software company in lanham that went public in  underwritten by wachtel  co in the letter which was filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission wachtel called for the firm to be sold relinquished her seat on what she called its overly deferential fivemember board of directors and reprimanded chief executive steven r chamberlain for withholding information from board members about misdemeanor sexoffense and assault charges filed against him in june  charges that he denies wachtel wrote that chamberlain informed his senior staff of the charges but did not inform the board because he took the position that the criminal charges were purely personal the company said last week that a review found no substantial merit to ms wachtels concerns but did not specifically address her assertions wachtels letter created what a friend called a reputational risk for her and for the institution her parents launched with  in savings more than four decades ago theres always a problem when you raise a stink that youll be characterized as a crank or a loose cannon or whatever said michael besche a maryland oil executive and a wachtel  co client since  i have found her to be nothing but a straight arrow    ive been to lots of shareholders meetings with bonnie where she stands up and asks pretty pointed questions no softballs and with risk comes potential reward if shes proved right then she will gain a reputation amongst savvy investors and people will look upon her as a very useful person to have on a board said paul hodgson a senior research associate at the corporate library a research group in maine wachtel who joined the family business in  does not regret going public and though some integral directors sided with chamberlain she said shes received supportive calls from several of integral systems largest shareholders in the past week i feel extremely confident about what i did out there wachtel said in an interview you cant persuade me i was wrong because i was outnumbered bonnie wachtel a lawyer with an mba is softspoken but she is also plainspoken bonnie is opinionated    she is straightforward and like all the wachtels extremely honest said john sanders who worked with her father sid for about  years starting in the late s and he said like all wachtels shes frugal and smart with money its in the genes said sanders who maintains close ties with the firm and is chairman of the washington dc technology council sid wachtel a new york native founded wachtel  co with his wife irma in  after leaving his job as a treasury department economist the early years were so lean that irma wachtel supported the family working various data processing jobs at small companies those jobs proved useful for more reasons than one she introduced sid to entrepreneurs he sealed the deals the focus was on small washington area technologyservicerelated firms that attracted no attention from big wall street investment houses the goal was to take companies public with small stock offerings being careful not to raise more money than the company absolutely needed then sid wachtel would sell the new shares to investors interested for the long term the wachtels often hold on to shares in local companies they know well for more than  years such as construction firm williams industries inc of manassas they want companies they can reach out and touch said marianne v pastor a williams industries vice president they want to go out and kick the tires the wachtels encouraged their daughters to get involved in the business early by age  bonnie was stamping documents alphabetizing files and answering phones at the office her older sister wendie l wachtel was a registered stockbroker by age  and never left the family business bonnie left for college then law school then a brief stint at a new york law firm before joining wachtel  co in  with sid and irma now retired bonnie wachtel  and wendie wachtel  run the show with help from one fulltime employee a cashier the firm with  active clients is worth  million net not including the net worth of each family member which is not a matter of public record the two advise clients on their investments buy and sell stocks and bonds for individuals and finance the same kinds of technology service startups that initially intrigued their father the firm also compiles a weekly chart on the performance of local stocks trading over the counter that appears in this section in  wachtel  co posted profit of  and revenue of  according to its most recent financial statement weve had enough success over the years that were not so hungry anymore bonnie wachtel said weve made a bunch of money and were trying to keep our affairs small and manageable her two largest individual holdings are integral systems  of which she owns about  million worth of stock exclusive of options she received as director  and vse corp an engineering services firm in alexandria of which wachtel is a director and in which she owns about  million worth of stock vse stock jumped to more than  a share from  in the past two years but several people who have worked with wachtel say that even when a stock tanks she does not retreat sandor rosenberg chief executive of software development firm information analysis inc in fairfax said his company appointed wachtel director about  years ago years later the company was a highflying firm with a market cap close to  million and a product designed to fix computer programs related to the yk crash that never happened then the companys  million net worth tumbled to a negative  million rosenberg said bonnie was there to help us keep our head screwed on properly he said shes the kind of person you want in your foxhole when times are good and when times are bad as for taking on a public fight with integral systems a company she described as a financial windfall wachtel said it was the right thing to do because the shareholders may well choose to take action and i think action is warranted wendie wachtel settled into her desk a stones throw from her sisters added and the shareholders deserve to know they deserve it in her letters bonnie wachtel contends that integral systems troubles run so deep that its corporate minutes sometimes do not fully reflect meetings and board members are given little time to review decisions as fundamental as those involving executive compensation still the company reported a profit of  million in fiscal  on revenue of  million that profit was down slightly from the previous year if we were doing such a bad job then the company could not be announcing forward guidance announcing record profitability said r doss mccomas one of two integral outside directors wachtel said deferred too much to chamberlain wachtel dismissed the argument corporate governance is not just for companies that are having financial problems she said we try very hard to set up arrangements where the interest of management and shareholders is aligned so that the ultimate success is something shared by both groups thats what corporate governance is about patrick ryan who recently retired after  years in the securities industry and knows wachtel  co professionally said it can be downright dangerous to shirk governance issues in the postenron days after boards were blamed for falling asleep at the wheel now more than ever if one accepts the responsibility of serving as director of a company one also has to accept the fiduciary responsibility that goes with the title of director ryan said they cant sit there like a frog on a log but generally directors do not go running to the public at the first sign of trouble either he said if a teacher cant discipline a rowdy student ryan said she doesnt immediately go running to the principals office to get him kicked out of school she tries to fix the problem herself ryan said he is not familiar with wachtels disagreement with integral systems wachtel said she tried for about a year to do just that before embarking on her letterwriting campaign in the end wachtel who has a keen interest in philosophy decided that she would not succumb to moral relativism there generally is a right and a wrong she said i think i may have made that clear staff researcher richard drezen contributed to this report
