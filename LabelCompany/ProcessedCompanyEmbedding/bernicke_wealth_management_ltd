help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life at one time or another we all face major turning points in our lives—getting married becoming a parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances timelines and investing preferences more insights wondering what its like to work with an advisor tune in to a candid conversation on “the value of advice” watch the webcast  how will we keep my strategy on course even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change an advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone one of an advisors most vital functions is to reach out at such times hear your concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship

quicken logo quicken logo united statescanada cart sign inmy account investment portfolio you are here what is money management money management refers to how you handle all aspects of your finances from making a budget for where each paycheck goes to setting longterm goals to picking investments that will help you to reach those goals money management is not just about saying no to any purchase but developing a plan that allows you to say yes to the things that are most important to you any amount of money can prove to be too little if you dont have good money management skills knowing where youre at the start of good money management requires you to know where youre at in terms of assets things you own and liabilities amounts you owe your assets include your bank accounts investment accounts retirement accounts and property like your house and car your liabilities include your credit card balances student loans car loans mortgages and other debts when you subtract your assets from your liabilities you get your net worth if your liabilities are more than your assets your net worth is negative but with good money management you can change that setting your goals your goals dictate how you manage your money its easy to overlook your longterm goals in favor of just trying to figure out which bills get paid today however by setting goals you can give clarity to which expenses are necessary and which ones you can cut out there isnt a universal right and wrong when it comes to your spending goals but it takes effort to attain them if its your dream to have a car that costs  you have to make more spending cuts than someone who only wants to spend  on a car creating and adjusting your budget creating a budget helps you stay on top of managing your money because you earmark certain amounts for certain expenses for example you might limit yourself to  for entertainment each month after accounting for other basic necessities and debt payments however your budget can be a moving target over time if you realize you can buy groceries on sale and save  a month you might increase your entertainment budget to  and add  to your savings budget alternatively if you get a pay raise budget that raise into your savings rather than adding it to discretionary spending amounts managing multiple accounts as you save for different goals you will likely have money in multiple accounts for example you might keep your emergency fund in a separate savings account so you arent tempted to tap it for an impulse purchase also you can use an ira or k plan to keep your retirement nest egg separate from your other money youll also use different strategies for goals with different time horizons you might be able to be more aggressive investing in stocks and bonds with funds in your retirement account if you wont need the money for  years on the other hand you will want an account with out any risk such as a savings account for your emergency fund because you could need that money at any time a software program such as quicken can help you keep track of your various accounts to make sure youre staying on track with your spending and savings goals did this

investment portfolio you are here what is budgeting budgeting refers to the process of determining how you are going to spend your money using software like quicken can help you track your spending so you can make sure youre on target for your financial goals and if you fall behind you can make changes to your budget and readjust your spending habits budgeting is a guide your budget for any particular time period is a guide for how you want to spend your money so that you can achieve your financial goals  both in the shortterm and the longterm when you set up a budget you can see where your money could go and then you get to decide in advance which options are most important for you for example if you dont have a budget that snazzy new outfit or topoftheline grill might catch your attention in the store and get you to buy it even though you should be putting your money elsewhere however if you have a budget and you know you want to prioritize saving for a new car or a house down payment you can turn down impulse purchases because you know the money is already earmarked for something more important gathering necessary information to make a budget you need to know your income and your expenses income includes not only your paycheck but also any other money you receive such as rent from a rental property or interest on a bank account your expenses include anything you spend money on such as housing food clothing insurance entertainment and travel to make an accurate budget it helps to have several months worth of your past spending documented so you can make realistic predictions about how much you spend in each category if you havent tracked your spending in the past just use your best estimate and adjust it as needed as you get more information budgets are for everyone budgeting is something that everyone regardless of income or net worth can benefit from no matter how much money you make you can always go bankrupt if you spend more than you bring in however budgets are also very personal in that you decide which goals are most important to you for example one person might put a high value on driving an expensive car and be willing to work an extra job or cut back on other expenses to have one while another person might be content to drive a used car into the ground to save up for a special vacation budgeting is a process as much as some people might prefer to set their budget and forget about it good financial planning requires you to reevaluate your spending over time and adjust your budget accordingly for example if you change jobs so that your commute is shorter each day you may be able to reduce the amount you have budgeted for gas costs and increase your retirement savings or if the cost of food goes up you may have to cut back on the amount of times you eat out each month did this article help you yes it did no it didntim not sure why was this specific article not helpful the article didnt cover what i thought it would

logo quicken logo united statescanada cart sign inmy account investment portfolio you are here what is retirement planning retirement planning is the process of setting goals for your retirement years and then creating a plan to fulfill those goals executing a retirement plan requires most people to put aside some of their current income for longterm savings and investment you can use taxsheltered vehicles such as traditional individual retirement accounts iras and employer pension plans to fund part of your retirement plan with pretax dollars living and working longer early in the process youll want to decide at what age youd like to retire it might be a rough estimate at this point subject to change as the years roll by many people today are living and working longer than those in previous generations the centers for disease control and prevention reported in  that the us populations average life expectancy rose to a record high of  years gallup polls show that in  the average american expects to retire at age  up from the  figure of age  actual retirement ages have also crept up during this period from  to  years of age setting goals youll need to make an educated guess about the percentage of your preretirement annual income to save for your postretirement years a figure known as the replacement rate a  research paper from morningstar investment management indicated that the usual replacement rate of  to  percent may be too high by as much as  percent your individual replacement rate depends on several factors including your earning power while working and your desired lifestyle after retirement lifetime planning armed with estimates of your retirement age and your replacement ratio you can start formulating a longterm plan that shows how much youll have to set aside each year to meet your retirement goals quickens lifetime planner tool helps you determine the size of your retirement nest egg and the amount you can withdraw each year so that the money lasts through your expected lifetime you can include other sources of retirement income such as social security and company pensions quicken lifetime planner provides longterm planning facilities that can help you organize the information in an easytounderstand format and track progress toward your goals explore your options you might want to explore different options when setting up your retirememt plan you can work out variations of your plan in which you change your income estimates the amount you save and invest each year your expected rate of return on your investments your retirement age or other factors for example you can experiment with the age at which you start receiving social security payments youre eligible for these payments at age  but the longer you postpone these the more youll eventually get each month you get the maximum payment if you wait until age  to begin drawing your social security payments another option is retiring in stages gradually shifting from fulltime employment to parttime work that you can do at home such as writing or consulting you might also need to adjust your assumptions about your postretirement lifestyle did this article help
