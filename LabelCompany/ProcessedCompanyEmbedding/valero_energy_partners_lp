predecessor for accounting purposes for periods prior to their dates of acquisition references in these notes to valero may refer to valero energy corporation one or more of its subsidiaries or all of them taken as a whole other than valero energy partners lp any of its subsidiaries or its general partner we acquired the following businesses from valero in  on september   we acquired the meraux and three rivers terminal services business for total consideration of  million on april   we acquired the mckee terminal services business for total consideration of  million each acquisition was accounted for as the transfer of a business between entities under the common control of valero accordingly the statement of income data operating highlights and capital expenditures data have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of operations of the acquired businesses for periods prior to their dates of acquisition b the increase in operating revenues in the three and six months ended june   compared to the three and six months ended june   was due primarily to  million and  million respectively of incremental revenues generated by the acquired businesses described in note a and  million and  million respectively of revenues generated by our red river crude system prior to being acquired by us the businesses described in note a did not charge valero for services provided and did not generate revenues effective with the date of each acquisition we entered into additional schedules to our commercial agreements with valero with respect to the services we provide to valero using the assets of the acquired businesses this resulted in new charges for terminaling services provided by these assets in addition effective january   we acquired a  percent undivided interest in i the newly constructed hewitt segment of plains all american lps red river pipeline ii two  shell barrel capacity tanks located at hewitt station and iii a pipeline connection from hewitt station to wasson station collectively the red river crude system c the increase in operating expenses in the three months ended june   compared to the three months ended june   was due primarily to higher maintenance expense of  million at the houston st charles corpus christi and three rivers terminals which was mainly related to inspection activity in addition we incurred total incremental expenses of  million related to our red river crude system and the rail loading facility at our st charles terminal which was placed in service in the second quarter of  the increase in operating expenses in the six months ended june   compared to the six months ended june   was due primarily to total incremental expenses of  million related to our red river crude system and the rail loading facility at our st charles terminal d the increase in general and administrative expenses in the three months ended june   compared to the three months ended june   was due primarily to higher public company costs of  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in the six months ended june   compared to the six months ended june   was due primarily to transaction costs of  in  associated with the acquisition of businesses from valero e the increase in depreciation expense in the three and six months ended june   compared to the three and six months ended june   was attributed primarily to depreciation expense recognized on the assets that compose our red river crude system which was acquired in the first quarter of  f the increase in interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest in the three and six months ended june   compared to the three and six months ended june   was due primarily to the following incremental borrowings in connection with the  acquisitions in connection with the acquisitions described in note a we borrowed  million and  million under our revolving credit agreement interest expense on the incremental borrowings was approximately  million and  million in the three and six months ended june   respectively incremental interest expense incurred on the senior notes in december  we issued  million of  senior notes due december  we used the proceeds of the senior notes to repay  million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility the interest rate on these senior notes is higher than our revolving credit facility thereby increasing the effective interest rate in  incremental interest expense resulting from these senior notes was approximately  million and  million in the three and six months ended june   respectively higher interest rates in  as a result of higher interest rates experienced in  we incurred additional interest of  and  million in the three and six months ended june   respectively on borrowings under our subordinated loan agreements with valero g the requirements under our partnership agreement for the conversion of all of our outstanding subordinated units into common units were satisfied upon the payment of our quarterly cash distribution on august   therefore effective august   all of our subordinated units which were owned by valero were converted on a oneforone basis into common units the conversion of the subordinated units does not impact the amount of cash distributions paid or the total number of outstanding units the subordinated units were only allocated earnings generated by us through the conversion date h represents the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment divided by the number of days in the period the increase in pipeline transportation throughput in the three and six months ended june   compared to the three and six months ended june   was due primarily to volumes at our red river crude system which was acquired in the first quarter of  i management uses average revenue per barrel to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry there are a variety of ways to calculate average revenue per barrel different companies may calculate it in different ways we calculate average revenue per barrel as revenue divided by throughput for the period throughput is derived by multiplying the throughput barrels per day bpd by the number of days in the period investors and analysts use this financial measure to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance j average pipeline transportation revenue per barrel was higher in the three and six months ended june   compared to the three and six months ended june   due primarily to higher pipeline transportation revenue per barrel generated by our red river crude system which was acquired in the first quarter of  k storage and other revenues was higher in the three and six months ended june   compared to the three and six months ended june   due primarily to revenues generated by the rail loading facility at our st charles terminal which was placed in service in the second quarter of  l defined terms are as follows ebitda is defined as net income less income tax expense interest expense and depreciation expense distributable cash flow is defined as ebitda less i ebitda attributable to predecessor and cash payments during the period for interest income taxes and maintenance capital expenditures plus ii adjustments related to minimum throughput commitments capital projects prefunded by valero and certain other items distribution coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total distribution declared these terms are not defined under united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are considered nongaap measures management has defined these terms and believes that the presentation of the associated measures is useful to external users of our financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies to describe our expectation of forecasted earnings assess our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded limited partnerships in the transportation and logistics industry without regard to historical cost basis or in the case of ebitda financing methods assess the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders assess our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and assess the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities we believe that the presentation of ebitda provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations the us gaap measures most directly comparable to ebitda are net income and net cash provided by operating activities ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with us gaap ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income or net cash provided by operating activities ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap additionally because ebitda may be defined differently by other companies in our industry our definition of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utility we use distributable cash flow to measure whether we have generated from our operations or earned an amount of cash sufficient to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distributions our partnership agreement contains the concept of operating surplus to determine whether our operations are generating sufficient cash to support the distributions that we are paying as opposed to returning capital to our partners because operating surplus is a cumulative concept measured from our initial public offering ipo date and compared to cumulative distributions from the ipo date we use distributable cash flow to approximate operating surplus on a quarterly or annual rather than a cumulative basis as a result distributable cash flow is not necessarily indicative of the actual cash we have on hand to distribute or that we are required to distribute we use the distribution coverage ratio to reflect the relationship between our distributable cash flow and the total distribution declared copyright c  globenewswire inc all rights reserved quoteszigmancomposite add to watchlist vlp valero energy

of ways to calculate average revenue per barrel different companies may calculate it in different ways we calculate average revenue per barrel as revenue divided by throughput for the period

ebitda less i ebitda attributable to predecessor and cash payments during the period for interest income taxes and maintenance capital expenditures plus ii adjustments related to minimum throughput commitments capital projects prefunded by valero and certain other itemsdistribution coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total distribution declaredthese terms are not defined under united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are considered nongaap measures management has defined these terms and believes that the presentation of the associated measures is useful to external users of our financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies todescribe our expectation of forecasted earningsassess our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded limited partnerships in the transportation and logistics industry without regard to historical cost basis or in the case of ebitda financing methods assess the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholdersassess our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures andassess the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunitieswe believe that the presentation of ebitda provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations the us gaap measures most directly comparable to ebitda are net income and net cash provided by operating activities ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with us gaap ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income or net cash provided by operating activities ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap additionally because ebitda may be defined differently by other companies in our industry our definition of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utilitywe use distributable cash flow to measure whether we have generated from our operations or “earned” an amount of cash sufficient to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distributions our partnership agreement contains the concept of “operating surplus” to determine whether our operations are generating sufficient cash to support the distributions that we are paying as opposed to returning capital to our partners because operating surplus is a cumulative concept measured from our initial public offering ipo date and compared to cumulative distributions from the ipo date we use distributable cash flow to approximate operating surplus on a quarterly or annual rather than a cumulative basis as a result distributable cash flow is not necessarily indicative of the actual cash we have on hand to distribute or that we are required to distributewe use the distribution coverage ratio to reflect the relationship between our distributable cash flow and the total distribution declaredreblogsharetweetsharerecently viewedyour list is emptywhat to read nextconocophillips trims capex after posting quarterly
