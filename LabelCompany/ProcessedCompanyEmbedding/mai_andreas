in his other compilation works the cd is worth it for verdi prati alone though i try not to listen to it too often as i cant concentrate for hours afterwards yes its well known and has been sung and recorded by scores of other singers in a variety of voices but absolutely noone not even the magnificent sarah connolly can come close to andreas scholls version which simply penetrates your mind body and souloh and theres some pretty decent other arias too se in fiorito is very sprightly but its worth getting hold of the dvd of the  copenhagen opera production to see it performed with the stunning finnish violinist of concerto copenhagen  it is  minutes of sheer magic actually the entire dvd of that production is just outstanding including the other aria on this cdim forced to agree with the earlier reviewer that there is rather more orchestral music than might have been anticipated but the akademie are always worth hearing and there are a few surprises which would have passed me by otherwise besides it really doesnt matter when you listen to the arias nothing else much matterscomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product
