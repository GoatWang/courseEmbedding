thank you for joining us this afternoon on today’s call i will cover the highlights of the quarter both operationally and financially provide an update on our key initiatives and then finish the call by going over our financial results in greater detail before opening the call up for questions overall we are very pleased with the progress we made during the quarter to continue the positive momentum from  and the first quarter of fiscal  although we faced certain distractions during the quarter such as our corporate relocation and the proxy contest im very proud of the way our team remained focused on our business and continued executing on our initiatives i believe that with a business that is transforming and improving as well as a strong balance sheet that provides us with greater financial flexibility we are well positioned to create longterm growth and value for our stockholders turning to a few highlights from the quarter first coffee pound volume coffee volume was up  making this our fourth consecutive quarter that we have achieved volume growth rate of mid singledigits or greater for the quarter we processed and sold  million pounds of green coffee compared to  million pounds during the prior year period we are pleased to see our volume growth being driven by both existing and new customers we also continue to see expansion in gross margin where we saw yearoveryear improvement gross profit for the quarter increased  to  million from  million in the prior year period while gross margin increased  basis points to  in the quarter driven by lower conversion costs and the hedge costs of green coffee second quarter net income was  million significantly higher than the prior year due to several onetime items most prominently being a gain on the sale of our torrance facility which we will discuss in greater detail later in the call restructuring and transition expenses related to the corporate relocation plan in the second quarter were down  million compared to the second quarter of last fiscal year as we near completion of our relocation activities as anticipated we currently expect that third quarter will be the last remaining quarter of significant expenses related to this project net income was also impacted by an increase in interest rates which affected the value of our preferred portfolio and net unrealized losses associated with specific hedging devices for certain direct ship customers as a background we hedge a significant amount of our portfolio based on direction from our customers and they pay the cost of the hedge through the price of their coffee our ability to use derivatives to assist our customers in buying coffee has been well received by our partners and they look at this activity as value added to our services this quarters negative impact to our pl was a noncash item and we expect to see this reverse over time next a few comments on the overall business id like to touch upon our key events in the quarter including the initial results from the china mist acquisition our strategic acquisition of west coast coffee our corporate relocation plan and share some thoughts on expectations for the future as we mentioned on our last call we successfully completed our acquisition of china mist in october and began the process of bringing the china mist business under our umbrella we are very pleased with the progress thus far and we are currently running ahead of expectations their strong distribution network provided a new capability and hybrid model that works in tandem with our dsd and direct capabilities we very much appreciate china mist culture with respect to areas such as their sustainable practices which we feel is cut from the same cloth as our own in addition their portfolio of products created a strong push into the premium tea category for farmer brothers building upon in a different but important way our existing award winning tea products we continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunity to expand our business and better serve our customers through this transaction and believe that our positive experience with this transaction will serve us well as we explore additional ma opportunities including our latest acquisition that being west coast coffee we are excited to announce that earlier today we closed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of west coast coffee for up to  million west coast is a portland based coffee manufacturer and distributor that offers a broad array of specialty coffees throughout the northwest that we believe will be synergistic to our current portfolio local convenience stores factor heavily among the customers of their strong local dsd business we have found that their experienced management team has developed strong brand loyalty in the region that we believe will enhance our penetration in the area we are thrilled to welcome west coast coffee to farmer brothers and expect they will be a great addition to our business turning to our corporate relocation plan we have completed our move from torrance california to north lake texas and are now up and running in our new corporate headquarters during the quarter we successfully completed the decommissioning and exit from the torrance facility and the exit and expiration for the lease back lease that meant that we could record the gain of  million from the sale of the property distribution commenced out of the north lake texas distribution center in november of  we exited our temporary headquarters and have effectively transitioned all corporate administrative functions into the new facility in addition progress continues in readying our new state of the art production facility and with our roasters being installed we continue to expect to commence production by the end of our third fiscal quarter finally we remain on track to achieve the expected  million to  million in annualized cost savings from our corporate relocation as to customer wins we continue to sign up new customers and have recently secured several new accounts in our dsd business such as comcast in the telecommunications industry which has approximately  properties skyline healthcare with approximately  which is a healthcare group purchasing organization and stop and save convenience stores nearly all of these customer locations have been installed and are up and running smoothly as we mentioned one of our newest wins with ssp an operator of branded products and food kiosks in retail locations and airports around the us ssp has now been buying from farmer brothers for approximately a month ahead of our original expectations we plan to be servicing  airports and  individual outlets once the rollout is complete but we couldnt be happier with the progress we are continuing to see growth in our existing customer base which combined with additional prospects in our active pipeline should position us for strong activity through the remainder of the fiscal year before i discuss our quarterly results in greater detail i want to update you want our cfo search our boards search committee has engaged an independent search firm to conduct a nationwide search and is currently evaluating several promising candidates generally speaking we feel that the search process is proceeding well and weve been very encouraged by the candidates that have been reviewed thus far and while the board is taking the appropriate time to find a candidate that will be a good fit with the company and the rest of the team we continue to have an experienced and resilient financial team that is doing a fantastic job as evidenced by our smooth reporting process this quarter now back to the quarter on the income statement net sales in the second quarter of fiscal  were  million   even excuse me representing  decrease as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in net sales of spice products and coffee products partially offset by increases in the net sales of tea spice sales were down  million or approximately  of total sales from the sale of our institutional spice business to harris in december  as i mentioned we had a  increase in coffee pound sold in the second quarter which was offset by  million in price decreases from sales to customers utilizing commodity based pricing arrangements gross margin in the second quarter was  compared to  in the second quarter of fiscal  or a  basis point improvement the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by lower conversion costs and lower hedge cost to green coffee partially offset by the decrease in net sales also the liquidation of lifo inventory primarily from a reduction in spice product inventories added about  to gross profit during the quarter overall we experienced another quarter of gross margin expansion operating expenses in the second quarter were  million as compared to  million recorded in the prior year period the decrease was primarily due to recognition of the gain on the sales of the torrance facility and lower restructuring and other transition expenses in connection with our corporate relocation plan offset by an increase in sga selling expenses increased  million during the quarter as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the consolidation of china mist operations and consulting expenses related to operations general and administrative expenses increased  million primarily due to nonreoccurring proxy contest related expenses acquisition related consulting expenses also contributed to the increase in ga expenses we expect to be actively evaluating additional business development opportunities going forward and so a portion of these types of expenses will likely continue during the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred  million in legal and professional service expenses from the  proxy contest that we do not expect to reoccur income from operations in the second quarter was  million compared to  million in the prior year period an improvement of  million primarily related to factors i just mentioned such as the gain on the torrance facility total other expense was  million in the second quarter of fiscal  as compared to total other income of  in the second quarter of fiscal  the increase was primarily due to book losses on derivative instruments and on our investment portfolio totaling  million as well as higher interest rate expense  higher interest expense resulting from onetime noncash interest expense related to the sale leaseback of the torrance facility this compares to the net gains on derivative instruments and investments of  reported in the second quarter from the prior year as i mentioned earlier we periodically enter into particular derivative instruments on behalf of certain customers accounting rules dictate that we marktomarket the non designated instruments and that caused the fluctuations in value this quarter unfortunately these market changes are not within our control and can cause shortterm gains and losses the book loss we recorded in the second fiscal quarter in  is expected to reverse over time in the cost of goods sold we had an effective tax rate of  in the second quarter as compared to a tax rate of  in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year we recorded an income tax expense of  million as compared to  in the second quarter of fiscal  the companys effective tax rate for the second quarter of  was higher than the us statutory rate of  primarily due to state income tax expense and higher as compared to the second quarter of fiscal  because in the second quarter of fiscal  we have reported a valuation allowance against our tax deferred assets as a reminder we released the majority of our valuation allowance against our prior deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of all the factors i mentioned net income was  million in the second quarter of fiscal  as compared to  million in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year net income for diluted common share in the second quarter was a  versus a net income per diluted common share of  in the prior year quarter moving on to nongaap our nongaap net income was  million in the second quarter of fiscal  versus  million in the prior year period our nongaap net income for diluted common share was  in the second quarter of fiscal  versus  in the second quarter of the prior year nongaap net income in the quarter excluded the impact of  million on net gains from the sale of the torrance facility or  per diluted common share noncash income tax expense on nongaap adjustments of  million or  per diluted common share restructuring and other transition expenses of  million or  per diluted common share and nonrecurring proxy contest related expenses of  million or  per diluted common share our adjusted ebitda margin was  during the quarter versus  in the second quarter of  now lets turn to the balance sheet as of december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents additionally we had  million in shortterm investments as of december   we had  million borrowed in outstanding on a revolving credit facility as of december   we utilized  million in letters of credit and had  million of excess availability on the credit facility based on our borrowing base capacity for the second quarter of fiscal  our capital expenditures were  million as compared to  million in the second quarter of fiscal   million is related to our new facility and  million for our routine capital expenditures primarily consisting of coffee brewing equipment as well as vehicles machinery and other equipment following the lines of the balance sheet the texas facility is now included in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter of fiscal  was  million versus  million in the prior year period as of december   we helped coffee related derivative instruments covering  million notional pounds of green coffee as compared to  million pounds covered as of june   in addition we had green coffee fixed price contract commitments of  million which is  million higher than december   as of december   we had  million in coffee inventory processed and nonprocessed and  million in tea and culinary inventory processed and unprocessed a combination of increased coffee related derivative instruments and the increase in fixed price green coffee contract commitments has helped to increase the price certainty of our green coffee cost i would now like to discuss some of the details relating to our corporate relocation plan since the project started in  the company has recognized a total of  million in cash costs including employee retention and separation benefits of  million facility related costs of  million related to temporary office space and  million associated with the move of our headquarters and other related costs we have estimated we will incur approximately  million in aggregate cash cost in connection with these restructuring and other transition expenses associated with the relocation plan as i mentioned earlier we expect that this will be the last remaining quarter of significant expenses related to the relocation plan with the remainder to be recognized in the third quarter we also recognized approximately  in noncash interest expense and  million in noncash rent for the torrance facility as part of the sale leaseback in addition we may incur certain pension related costs with the relocation essentially complete we continued to estimate that the total construction cost including cost of land will still total approximately  million to  million and the cost of equipment and it furniture and fixtures and other in the  million to  million range as of december   the company has spent  million on the construction of the building including land cost final completion of and relocation to the new facility are expected to conclude in the third quarter as i mentioned above our corporate relocation plan remains on track to produce cost savings of approximately  million to  million annually in closing we are successfully executing on our turnaround strategy and key initiatives as we continue to focus our efforts on delivering both operational and financial improvements this past quarters performance is a testament to the teams ability to perform even in the face of challenges and distractions and im excited about what we can accomplish next with these issues behind us furthermore as we continue to build a solid foundation for future growth we are also actively seeking and finding new and exciting sources of growth with our latest acquisitions of china mist and west coast coffee these are two recent examples of our success while we felt that is reasonably as three years ago the company was not in a strong enough position to appropriately manage a healthy business development program a combination of our improving performance coupled with progress with recent acquisitions has helped to refine our perspective on our ability to capitalize on future market opportunities additionally we remain focused on strengthening our dsd group winning new customers increasing volume with existing customers and improving efficiencies to drive profitability higher finally i want to emphasize that the board and management team is fully committed to working with all of our stockholders to ensure we are doing all that we can to deliver longterm sustainable growth and value creation for all stakeholders we receive strong support from stockholders during the proxy contest including both the investment community as well as our employee participants we are also dedicated to doing more and have recently hired an ir firm to assist us in increasing our transparency and communication efforts and ensure we are employing industry best practices coffee remains an exciting area and we believe were well positioned to be a preferred partner of choice we look forward to continuing to share our progress with you in coming quarters and with that id like to open up the calls to a few questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of francesco pellegrino of sidoti your line if open francesco pellegrino good afternoon mike michael h keown hi how are you francesco pellegrino pretty good so a second straight quarter where you throw in acquisition at us so you did your first acquisition after the hiatus from the  period small acquisition then you did china mist the last quarter you did west coast coffee today china mist is at  million this west coast coffee was at  million when we think of acquisitions are we thinking the sweet spot is somewhere between  million to  million is the focus on small – on acquiring a lot of small brands or acquiring a couple small brands and investing in their growth michael h keown its a good question i think theres two ways we evaluate acquisition opportunities one would be where we can get distribution efficiencies and i think west coast is a terrific example of that a very strong dsd system with a good brand that will work very synergistically in that regard another way we view it is through the lens of the brand and china mist actually brings us a wonderful brand with good equity and a different distribution network which i think is a wonderful benefit to answer your question in terms of size we really try to work off whats available in the market and what those opportunities are it could be larger i think as we grow muscles and show what we can do it could be more significant if that opportunity presents itself and i think thats what will let guide us whats the right fit what’s the right model for us and whats the right future not necessarily be driven by a certain size francesco pellegrino when i look at these acquisitions in the past obviously the company is exposed to a commodity are we investing in acquiring brands or more so the distribution efficiencies that you were talking about as ive seen this being done with some other companies that are like industrial grade commodity manufacturers and they almost built like a branded economic moat around the commodity business and at the end of the day youre acquiring a lot of these attractive small brands and you just look at where the commodity cost environment is for you for your customers its rather favorable and im just wondering if it makes more sense in the shortterm to acquire a lot of brands or just over the longterm to have this longterm strategy how aggressive are you going to be over the shortterm michael h keown you know again its difficult to say what i would tell you is we conducted a pretty thorough landscape assessment i think we might have mentioned it a quarter or two ago to give us a very good view of the us coffee industry and from that there were some targets that popped up either from a distribution size or branded perspective and in some cases there could be both that coupled with whats happening in the market is whats driving us it is a little bit difficult to answer your questions in a challenging environment francesco pellegrino the increase in the coffee bean volume growth of  is this with the increase in more so the dsd business the dtc business i know you said it was like a lot of small accounts so michael h keown well those were the ones that we  what i would say is if you look at the last four quarters i think weve averaged about  volume growth and in our business when i see basically fixed it is in the same range and things can move up and down a couple of points so im pleased with what weve accomplished over the last year i am very pleased with our string of wins in the dsd business over the last two quarters and i think its a real testament to the team thats executing there but we dont break it out as you probably remember by segment francesco pellegrino okay so if you dont break it out by segment and im just trying to think about the acquisition policy and sort of implementing brands into your portfolio is there may be a different way to talk about the quality of this growth was the majority of the quality of the growth in a branded category or was it in an unbranded category michael h keown in our most recent customer wins they were unbranded or we developed a brand for them and they were a notable string of wins that happened to be in our dsd group francesco pellegrino okay i know you haven’t completed the transition fully into the new north lake facility but at what point because only  because you brought it up there in your commentary about looking into additional business development opportunities for the company do you start looking at a conversation about maybe additional supply chain consolidation with manufacturing at houston as well as some of the distribution at oklahoma city when does that conversation make sense once youve fully moved into north lake a year after you moved into north lake what milestones are we looking to achieve before we start revisiting maybe some of the other dominoes that could fall for your story michael h keown you know i give you a lot of credit for being consistent in asking that question every call and im going to be consistent in not answering it but i can tell you that we dont have anything to announce at this time weve just come through our second quarter which you know is our busiest quarter due to seasonality and were pleased with the performance were always studying additional supply chain optimization in fact i referenced the consulting expense in the quarter and a portion of that was for a whole host of efficiency opportunities that we see but i dont have anything to announce to the hypothetical questions you are answering  asking now francesco pellegrino and my last question for you and ive been asking this of all my companies under a trump presidency i just look at i guess the employee base of a lot of the companies that i cover and some of them really rely on the hb visa program does farmer brothers have any reliance on this program historically whether its seasonal or whether its throughout the year michael h keown you know what we  i dont have anything really to comment on that its a human resource issue it would be inappropriate to comment francesco pellegrino okay thats it for me thanks again michael h keown thank you operator our next question comes from the line of kara anderson from b riley and company your line is open kara anderson hi mike how are you michael h keown doing well kara how are you kara anderson i am good thank you just wondering if you can provide more details on the west coast coffee acquisition with regards to maybe some revenue numbers or categories of product sold how the margins might compare to famer brothers products any greater context is helpful michael h keown so a couple areas that i could provide they serviced about  largely convenient stores through a dsd model that we think will be very synergistic with our own we generally think this is going to be accretive were optimistic about what this organization can hold for us in the longterm and thats probably as far as i can go right now kara anderson okay and then im not sure if i missed it on the capex for the equipment and machinery related to the new facility the  million to  million did you say what has been spent thus far and whats remaining and timing for that michael h keown no i did not so just to kind of give you a summary that the total are very consistent with what we did is in fact entirely in line with what we had disclosed previously rene do you have the spend she is looking that up right now we will see if we can get that by the end of the call kara otherwise well followup kara anderson sure and then also i guess sort of related could you talk about the balance of the  million to  million in annualized savings from the relocation with west and sort of expectation on timing for that michael h keown sure were probably about  to  through at this point some of its in process maybe even a little bit ahead of that so as the remainder of the project continues youll see it come through i will just reiterate from where weve come since we announced this in early  were pleased that were still well within the range weve accomplished quite a bit and i think youll see the rest of the initiatives come in line over the next quarter or so as i look back on it we had a little bit of slowness due to some rain in the facility start up may have been distracted a little bit through some of the start up of the new facility and some other issues but overall were very pleased with how far weve come in approximately two years kara anderson okay and then last question for me i know you talked about sort of having greater certainty on green coffee pricing given six contracts and derivatives that you have in place but with rising green coffee prices and what weve seen from other big players in the market do you have any plans to implement any pricing actions for those spot on commodity post pricing contracts michael h keown its a really good question so theres youll see a couple of things that what weve done in this regard if you were  if you heard what we talked about in terms of the length and the amount of some of our contracts i think we responded well to the market we have taken pricing in the market that is implemented even in the noncost plus world with certain lead times for various customers and so forth but we have and youve seen a number of the larger players in the category have and weve taken that opportunity too as it presents itself kara anderson great thank you michael h keown thank you operator our next question will be taken from the line of chris krueger from lake street capital your line is open chris krueger good afternoon michael h keown good afternoon how are you chris krueger good how are you michael h keown im doing well thanks chris chris krueger youre giving up providing figures on your new dsd wins you said comcast at  properties skylines  what was the number for that last one the stop and save michael h keown no i dont have it was smaller so well see if we can get it up but im going to guess  to  somewhere in that range it was a little smaller than the other chris krueger okay and i guess my other question just in general with the new president in place what are your thoughts on just importing and potential tariffs and all that kind of kind of overview there at least at first glance what do you guys think michael h keown im not familiar with anything that’s coffee specific at this point so i guess well let the political leaders work that out i tend to look at it a bit simplistic coffee continues to grow as you and i have spoken a key driver of that growth is millennials now we are all millennial now and to some extent driven by carbonated soft drink avoidance so i think the future of coffee is bright and i hope that theres nothing that pops up in any type of political or agricultural way or anything that would limit that its a very dynamic industry as you know in fact some of the factors you mentioned could come into play but also droughts and rust and other coffee diseases could be more of a concern for me in the shortterm chris krueger is there a specific incident on that in those areas right now or is that just something thats obvious michael h keown oh but if you look back over the last few years occasionally these things have popped up and i think that companies responded well and the boards been very supportive of providing us additional flexibility in our hedging program to adjust as we see that and if you look over the last five years in particular i think weve managed it pretty well chris krueger okay thats all i got thanks operator your next question comes from the line of carter dunlap from dunlap equity your line is open carter dunlap hi gentlemen i have a quick one at your annual meeting i think you cited that you had one person dedicated to ma has that grown michael h keown its one thats fully dedicated weve brought some other external resources on to help through some of these processes in a number of different areas and that would be the additional source of help has been more external than internal carter dunlap so you mean like a banker michael h keown yeah just  so lets just say consultants now carter dunlap okay thank you michael h keown thank you carter operator i’m seeing no other questioners in the queue at this time so i’d like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments michael h keown well thanks again we really appreciate your continued interest in farmer brothers and we are very excited about the future and look forward to sharing our plans for that future in the nearterm midterm and longterm thank you very much operator ladies and gentlemen thank you again for your participation in todays conference this now concludes
