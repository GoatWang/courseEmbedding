action on these specific land positions we can accelerate the realization of these longterm assets and related tax benefits we will then seek to redeploy the resulting capital into higher returning projects consistent with our investment and land holding goals” the companys planned actions will add to the  million previously realized from its sale of certain noncore assets since  as it seeks to

that would not yield suitable returns land in excess of nearterm need; and land entitled for certain product types that are inconsistent with the company’s primary offerings selling these assets shortens the duration of our land pipeline and moves the company toward its longterm goal of owning three years and optioning three years of lots added marshall    having a shorter and more efficient
