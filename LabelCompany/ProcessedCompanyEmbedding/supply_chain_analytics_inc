chain supply chain analytics what is it and why is it so important paul myerson  may   relying on traditional supply chain execution systems is becoming increasingly more difficult with a mix of global operating systems pricing pressures and ever increasing customer expectations there are also recent economic impacts such as rising fuel costs the global recession supplier bases that have shrunk or moved offshore as well as increased competition from lowcost outsourcers all of these challenges potentially create waste in your supply chain that’s where data analytics comes in data analytics is the science of examining raw data to help draw conclusions about information it is used in many industries to allow companies and organization to make better business decisions and in the sciences to verify or disprove existing models or theories in the past few years we’re hearing more and more about the use of data analytics in the supply chain  logistics function according to an article on ebn online betting on analytics as supply chains next big thing “some industry experts claim that the day for realtime supply chain practices has come  and is on the verge of being more mainstream thanks to a multitude of cloud data management tools and increased corporate adoption of new supply chain software platforms coming to market however theres also acknowledgement that a necessary foundation for moving efficiently at realtime speed  supply chain analytics  is still very much at the beginning stages of development at many companies and will take time to build out” the article points out that there’s definitely an increased interest in the subject especially in the areas of improved forecasting and sop sales and operations planning but that “upgrades and tool implementation take time” and that the data has to be both accurate and accessible in order to perform data analytics with its complex algorithms all businesses with a supply chain devote a fair amount of time to making sure it adds value but these new advanced analytic tools and disciplines make it possible to dig deeper into supply chain data in search of savings and efficiencies the supply chain is a great place to use analytic tools to look for a competitive advantage because of its complexity and also because of the prominent role supply chain plays in a company’s cost structure and profitability supply chains can appear simple compared to other parts of a business even though they are not if we keep an open mind we can always do better by digging deeper into data as well as by thinking about a predictive instead of reactive view of the data so while advanced supply chain analytics is promising in terms of making our supply chain leaner it may not be “ready for prime time”

factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
