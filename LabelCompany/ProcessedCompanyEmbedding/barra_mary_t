with a chevrolet bolt ev at gm headquarters in detroit credit joe vaughn for the new york times detroit — the chief executive of general motors an automaker synonymous with detroit saw the future of driving not in the motor city but on the streets of san franciscomary t barra a gm lifer who had worked her way from engineer to the top was in the back seat of a prototype selfdriving electric car as it wound its way through the city’s downtown a year agoshe wanted to see for herself whether automation was ready to take over from a driver — safely and on a mass scale how would it react for example when it reached an intersection as a light turned yellowdriving in a situation like that “you have to make a decision” she recalled in a recent interview “generally if you decide to go you decide to speed up or you stop” if the technology works she said it will make the right decision “the car knows” advertisement continue reading the main story after that drive ms barra made her own decision to speed up convinced that such cars were worth betting the company on within six months after what she called her “aha moment” in san francisco a fleet of selfdriving chevrolet bolts the company’s new electric car was being built at a gm assembly plant in michigan the pace accelerated at the direction of ms barra and her senior management team continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story it was a first for any major car company and the first leg of a race she is determined to win the question now is whether a company identified with the industry’s bygone glory days can be a trendsetter in stcentury transportation — and beat out silicon valley rivals like google tesla and uber with no legacy business to encumber them“the auto industry is on the cusp of significant change and gm has to prove that a longtime established player can be up to the task” said michelle krebs a senior analyst with the carshopping site autotrader who has followed the company since the s “if you look at their past performance their record has been spotty at best”general motors is making a big wager that it can succeed shedding overseas operations while investing  million this year in selfdriving cars and other advanced technologies it spent  billion on cruise automation a silicon valley startup that developed the driverless technology powering ms barra’s ride in san francisco it is a perilous challenge — balancing the demands of a global automotive business with an aggressive push into expensive hightech models — that has already claimed victims last month ford motor ousted its chief executive mark fields aiming to send a signal that it could keep pacebut gm is making a case that it can be a leader in the auto industry of both today and tomorrow “we are very very serious and intent on putting something on the road” ms barra said of the company’s automated vehicles “we definitely want to be first”like its rivals gm has ridden the economic recovery and low gas prices to record demand and profits but it faces headwinds as sales flatten and new technologies increasingly cast a shadow over its traditional business tesla the electriccar upstart is now valued more highly than any detroit automakerin shaping its future gm is betting on products that have yet to gain a foothold in the marketplace and could take years to develop fully advertisement continue reading the main story it is doing so while enduring criticism from president trump for building vehicles in mexico and for laying off workers at home at the same time ms barra has built a closer relationship with mr trump than other auto executives have serving on his business advisory panel and taking the lead for the industry in talks on fueleconomy rulesthe company is also fending off a campaign by a dissident investor to create two classes of stock aimed at increasing gm’s value to shareholders one class would pay a steady dividend while the other would appreciate based on the company’s growth the fight will culminate on tuesday at the annual shareholder meetingin a letter to investors last week the hedge fund that floated the dualclass proposal greenlight capital called gm’s board — including ms barra its chairwoman — “uninspired” for opposing its proposal “after seven years of a flat stock price how much longer must shareholders wait” the letter saidwhile she agrees the company is undervalued ms barra insists that gm’s performance will ultimately pay off in better returns “does it frustrate me” she said of the stock price “yes but i want to do the right things over the long term to improve the business”in beginning to assemble fully automated bolts in january gm was a step ahead of google and uber which are converting massmarket minivans and sedans into driverless models it went beyond what tesla has achieved with autonomous controls on its own models and it reflected the feverish competition underway graphic the race for selfdriving cars there are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived — and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think open graphic “we don’t go in to compete” ms barra said “we don’t go in to have an entry with every new product we’re doing we are going in to win”for ms barra  who took the helm at gm in  as the first female chief executive of a major automaker it is the latest chapter in the company’s

product development “what we were doing was robbing our good businesses to fix the broken ones”as gm streamlines operations in the united states and elsewhere it is redirecting energy and capital to its selfdriving initiative“i do believe general motors is a tech company” ms barra said “we put these products on the road that integrate  parts and have hundreds of millions of lines of code in them already and we have to make them durable and work in all environments”its commitment is on display at a sprawling plant in orion township mich about a minute drive northwest of detroit where the company builds conventional subcompact cars as well as boltsone area of the factory is dedicated to a smallscale assembly line where workers customize bolts with selfdriving equipment including a large computer in the trunk and modules packed with sensors on the roof and fenders “we’re on the cutting edge here” said bill rock a year gm veteran who works on the autonomous vehicle line “it’s a very complicated process but it’s the direction the company needs to go”gm has built about  autonomous bolts to be used for testing in arizona california and michigan by cruise automation now a subsidiary kyle vogt a founder of cruise said gm had given its engineers a distinct advantage by building a stateoftheart autonomous vehicle rather than retrofitting a conventional car“these vehicles coming off the assembly line have been built from the ground up” he said “that’s a real car and not a mashup of offtheshelf parts that need to be integrated into the system” advertisement continue

back decades is convinced of her resolve “mary is the right person at the right time and she does it without an ounce of showmanship” he saidthe challenge of autonomous vehicles is hardly her first test as chief executive her baptism by fire came during the congressional hearings and government investigations surrounding the faulty ignition switchms barra methodically directed the company to fix the defective parts revamp its safety procedures compensate accident victims and their families and negotiate settlements and fines with regulators and the justice departmentshe says the episode informed her approach to selfdriving cars which she believes herald a new era of road safety and left her impatient for results and she says she is determined for gm to lead the technological

comments  what makes the ceo’s story all the more compelling is that she grew up in a middleclass gm family and wound up leading the world’s secondlargest automaker if mary barra has any major faults you won’t find them in a new book entitled “road to power” wiley  sons  pages  it’s not that the author bloomberg news reporter laura colby didn’t try however the sources she interviewed and the articles she liberally cites have almost nothing but praise for general motors’ first female ceo the book’s subtitle is “how mary barra shattered the glass ceiling” but in charting barra’s life from her birth as mary makela on christmas eve  in suburban waterford mi to her thfloor renaissance center office in the company’s motor city headquarters overlooking the detroit river it turns out she didn’t so much as shatter glass as earn her way to the top as a brilliant engineer and a cando manager and executive what makes her story all the more compelling is that she grew up in a middleclass gm family and wound up leading the world’s secondlargest automaker her father was a journeyman die maker and member of the uaw union at gm’s pontiac motor div and her mother was a bookkeeper colby writes about women in business for bloomberg and it’s clear that despite recent successes by numerous females in reaching the top at major corporations she employs mlblike stats to argue that much more needs to be done that starts with the longstanding argument that women remain underpaid compared to men that they still face formidable obstacles to getting ahead in their careers and that they face verbal abuse in the workplace from their male counterparts anyone who has followed gm even marginally since its bankruptcy six years ago to its current faultyignitionswitch dilemma which reportedly has claimed more than  lives and caused hundreds of injuries will find much familiar reading in the book to answer an immediate question colby found no evidence barra knew of the switch problem which traces back more than years the switch failure turns off the ignition eliminating power to the airbags and increasing steering and braking effort which can cause drivers to lose control should she have known given her major engineering and productdevelopment assignments not if gm was as insular and silooriented as colby and others have underscored the problem was traced to decisions made at lower levels and from most accounts never surfaced up the ladder until wrongfuldeath suits began piling up colby’s book was published in march so it doesn’t include some later developments involving the faulty switches lawyers now are seeking depositions from former ceo rick wagoner who was fired as part of the government bailout and other highranking gm officials including barra barra inherited the mess when she took over as ceo  months ago since then she has appeared before congress where she received low marks for providing stock answers to tough questions colby writes but she also has been forceful firing  and suspending others setting up a  million fund for those killed or injured meeting with survivor families and naming a new safety czar to avoid future calamities barra has been a high achiever starting in her high school days colby writes she went on to attend the general motors institute now kettering university in flint mi where she earned a degree in electrical engineering in  the same year she married tony barra a fellow graduate engineer they have two children but colby provides very few details about her personal life barra began her gm career at the pontiac plant building the fiero small car but within three years was off to stanford university to pursue an mba sponsored by gm a clear sign she had been recognized as a “high potential” candidate from then on she moved up quickly although she rose through the engineering and manufacturing ranks she was tapped in  to report as an aide to thenceo jack smith at gm headquarters there she worked for both smith and vice chairman harry pearce “she stood out” pearce is quoted as saying “very easy to talk to very engaging not a big ego real thirst for knowledge” jack smith’s strategy – he declined to be interviewed by colby – was to give those destined for high jobs at gm an opportunity to gain experience “to understand the bigger picture” colby explains barra remained in the executive offices until  the last two years as general director of internal communications – a stint that honed her already impressive skills in that vital area barra shifted back to engineering and in  she was named manager of thevintage detroithamtramck plant with  employees a major leap in her career she had set her sights on running an assembly plant early on and the post paved the way for higher things to come from  to  she moved on to a series of increasingly important jobs  in manufacturing engineering including head of global human resources during gm’s bankruptcy period  dan akerson one of two interim ceos brought in from outside during gm’s postbankruptcy period in  named barra as executive vice presidentglobal product development purchasing and supply chain deemed by some as gm’s no job putting her over  employees in  countries and when he departed akerson chose barra as his successor comments about her personality and capabilities universally favorable from big names like bob lutz and mark reuss are sprinkled throughout “road to power” there also are some trifling errors any good editor would’ve caught overall however it’s a quick read as the first fulllength book about an exceptional woman as she battles to restore gm’s onceproud name while fighting daily headlines about those faulty switches i personally like one quote attributed to her “no more crappy cars” amen ms

gm discusses leadership lessons and the future of selfdriving carsjune  by bill snyder email the productdevelopment cycle at gm used to be measured in years these days it works at “startup speed” ceo mary barra says  tonibird photography running a yearold automobile company in the age of software ride sharing and selfdriving cars is the challenge faced by general motors ceo and chairwoman mary barra in the threeandahalf years she’s steered the iconic carmaker gm’s work force has entered a period of radical change nearly  of its salaried employees have been with the company fewer than five years she says barra’s company used to measure product development cycles in four or fiveyear increments now it’s learning to make changes in areas like its carsharing program on a weekly basis she says buying cruise automation — a developer of autonomous vehicle technology — last year adds more than new technology to gm it also drives the whole company “to work at startup speed” she recently told a group of stanford graduate school of business students life is too short to work for a company or be in a position that you dont lovemary barra although she’s one of the most powerful women in the business world and believes that diversity is critical to the success of gm barra sees herself as a champion of both men and women “when you solve issues for women you solve issues for everyone because a lot of the time men have the same issues” she says during a view from the top appearance on may  barra who earned her mba from stanford gsb in  spoke about the future of the auto business and her thoughts on managing a global organization in a period of rapid technological and social change how to handle a crisis shortly after becoming ceo barra was faced with a major crisis faulty ignition switches in some gm cars were causing serious even fatal accidents in managing the situation barra says “we were guided by three principles doing the right thing for the customer being transparent and doing everything in our power to make sure it never happened again” although it’s important to answer questions as soon as possible “you can’t answer questions you don’t know the answer to” says barra enabling a turnaround before she became ceo barra was part of gm’s senior leadership team and had been working to bring the company founded in  into the digital age her priorities included simplifying the company and eliminating bureaucracy “if you believe that most people come to work every day and want to do a good job then whats getting in their way do we have an environment a collaborative environment and the tools that are necessary so they can do their best work or is it painful to get the most simple task done” she says jobhopping is ok barra has worked at gm for  years but she doesn’t believe that a long tenure at a company necessarily makes a potential hire a good one nor does she think jobhopping is necessarily a negative people often leave jobs for good reasons she says “life is too short to work for a company or be in a position that you dont love” but if someone has held numerous positions in a short period of time barra says she might want to drill down to see if there’s an underlying issue that prompted the departures ultimately though barra adds the issue isn’t long tenure versus short tenure “its really about the skills and abilities and experiences that they bring and the leadership that they bring” learn how to be negative giving positive feedback is easy but managers must learn how to be critical as well barra says at gm the senior leadership team has several offsites a year where they learn how to give each other negative feedback that is also constructive they can have a direct conversation where “i don’t agree with you and it’s not personal” barra says selfdriving cars will remain rare for years an autonomous vehicle needs to be aware of exactly where it is what’s happening around it and what is the safest and most efficient route to take says barra a key enabling factor is vehicletovehicle communication although some of that capability can be added to existing cars — replacing the nation’s entire fleet of some  million conventional vehicles adds up to “a long journey” since only about  million new cars are sold in the us each year she says mary barra achieving results with integrity video of mary barra

woman carmaker wants to build vehicles that skimp on fuel—while they surge with style photo brian kelly big wheel barra senior vice president of global product development has charge of gms engineering and design view photo album  by jim tankersley mary barra was about  when she first fell in love with a car it was a red chevy camaro convertible lates vintage driven by her older cousin when barra describes it her brown eyes widen and her cheeks flush just a touch it was just a beautiful beautiful vehicle she says at her office high in the tower that houses general motors corporate headquarters the first vehicle where i went wow that is cool when the time came to buy herself a set of wheels barra still had muscle on her mind she plunked down a deposit on a pontiac firebird the iconic hot rod of the late s but at the last moment she blinked bound for college watching her budget she bought a chevrolet chevette an affordable boxy hatchback that the automaker marketed by emphasizing its legroom and trunk space promotional films from the time show the car struggling to stay on four wheels as it rattles around corners at suburban speeds she still thinks about that firebird today barras job—and her storied employers fate—boils down to making sure no car buyer ever wrestles with that kind of tradeoff again barra mba  took the wheel in february as gms senior vice president for global product development—and became the highestranking woman in the automotive industry in charge of engineering design and quality control for the worlds secondlargest automaker after toyota she has arrived just in time to lead gms product line into a very uncertain future as the world warms and oil prices rollercoaster upward automakers face the biggest overhaul of their industry since the birth of the assembly line we dont know what exactly the cars of the coming decades will look like they could plug into wall sockets or guzzle advanced biofuels or run on hydrogen fuel cells or even liquefied sunlight but in the increasingly globalized auto market we know consumers arent likely to buy any vehicle that doesnt deliver style and performance commensurate with its greener engine if gm wants to keep making and selling cars it must find a way to combine the practicality that drove mary barra into a chevette with the swoon she got from her cousins camaro barra understands the depth of the challenge whatever happens its going to be a more fuelefficient vehicle in    years she says my goal is to make sure we do that with a suite of products for customers based on their needs and wants later she adds were going to have beautiful innovative designs were going to put the right technology on the vehicle by consumer segment the way the customer wants it were going to have the right quality and the right performance features repeating that process—its as simple as that and as hard as that detroit automakers owe much of their highprofile woes over the past few decades to an inability to fit together those pieces—quality performance efficiency technology barra has seen the struggles firsthand she grew up in waterford mich where her father worked  years as a gm die maker that ohsopractical chevette took her to general motors institute since renamed kettering university in flint mich an engineering and management school that served as a sort of rotc for gm she earned an electrical engineering degree there interning at the plant that produced the sporty pontiac fiero when she started at the plant gm and its big three brethren were bleeding market share to japanese competitors such as honda and toyota whose cars american consumers had come to regard as more reliable and affordable the focus on the fiero line was quality reducing defects rebuilding public trust barra showed her faith by ditching the chevette for a black fiero her senior year in  a gm fellowship took barra to stanford to earn an mba she would go on to rise through the management ranks running engineering divisions and managing an assembly plant gm turned out increasingly reliable cars earned higher quality ratings and slowly but surely won back consumer confidence still its market share eroded by the early s gm was suffering under the weight of a cost structure—wages pensions healthcare costs—that made a standard gm vehicle thousands of dollars more expensive to produce than a foreign competitors to bridge the gap gm and other domestic automakers stripped many cars of pricey features such as plush interiors or advanced electronics—which only served to devalue the vehicles in customers eyes they also chased the higher profit margins in manufacturing trucks and large sport utility vehicles that got miserable gas mileage spiking oil prices in  caught detroit flatfooted the  financial crisis pushed gm and chrysler into bankruptcy barra tries not to dwell on the dark days before and after gm filed chapter —a period the companys employees from hourly workers to top executives discuss in graveyardwhistling tones like so many others at the downtown detroit headquarters she worked for days at a time with little sleep it was a very difficult and very humbling time barra says but she says she never doubted the company would survive were going to get through she says she kept thinking were going to make it through gm was saved only by billions of dollars in federal bailout funds the governmentapproved leadership tapped barra in july  to run the humbled companys human resources division then in january  ceo daniel akerson named her head of global product development the job placed barra one step below akerson on the gm corporate ladder one of the top seven executives in the company she oversees more than  employees worldwide and her daytoday huddles with designers and engineers determine which vehicles make it to the assembly line barra began her tenure with a tailwind of sorts—or as much of one as anyone has had at gm in years the company had shrugged off much of the weight of its uncompetitive cost structure largely through financial concessions won in emerging from bankruptcy and from closing or selling off product lines such as saturn and hummer it was starting to rake in profits again perhaps most important for its longterm viability gm like its domestic rivals was finally catching up to foreign automakers in addressing the chevettefirebird dilemma for a long time consumers of american cars could get a really sexy vehicle or a really practical one but they rarely got one that was both and if theres anything american consumers want its everything in one package maybe the best example is in the truck market pickups led by the ford f and the chevy silverado top the list of americas bestselling vehicles these truck buyers are not hauling beams to construction sites most buyers are suburbanites who just like to tow a boat on the weekend or flip down the tailgate outside the football stadium they want the power the performance the cool of a pickup ever since gas cracked  per gallon industry research shows truck buyers have clamored for vastly improved fuel economy—without sacrificing anything else ford has pushed hard to respond retooling its pickups with smaller more efficient engines that deliver the same power as a roaring v in f ads that run during tv football games guys guy actor denis leary brags about towing capacity and mpg in the same breath to combine performance and mileage in smaller cars gm recently introduced the chevrolet cruze a sleek little headturner aimed at young buyers that was the bestselling car in america in june the bigger test—for the company and for barra—will be the relaunch of the silverado and the rest of gms truck and suv line complicating matters is the volatility of gasoline prices which are trending up but have bounced from as low as  per gallon to as high as  per gallon in the past two years theyve got great small vehicles at gm says dave cole chairman emeritus of the independent center for automotive research in ann arbor mich thats not going to be a problem but to be successful in this environment to bet on a future high energy price youve got to hit your bet which means youve got to have products that work whatever the energy price is theres another balance the firm must strike gm increasingly needs to roll out products that work across emerging markets as well as traditional ones the more the company can use common platforms for cars around the world—which is to say build and sell the same cars in beijing and detroit—the more it can capture economies of scale and save money problem is buyers in china differ widely from buyers in michigan in terms of how far they drive what features they crave and how much they can spend on a vehicle the way somebody drives in india is very different than the way somebody drives in the united states barra says but she has to build for both with as much overlap as possible asia looms as gms most important market over the next decade china and india are home to droves of prospective firsttime car owners—young people who are rising out of poverty and into a middleclass lifestyle that includes a vehicle the scotiabank group forecasts chinese consumers will buy more than  million cars and trucks in  up from  million this year vehicle sales doubled over the past five years in india to  million units scotiabank says and are expected to double again by the end of the decade competition for this business will be fierce—especially from indian automakers who thanks to labor and production costs well below detroits are turning out starter cars that cost a few thousand dollars in contrast gms new michiganmade subcompact the sonic which incorporates several shopfloor and payscale innovations to minimize cost retails for about  in the united states to handle such challenges in the past gm relied on the legendary instincts of bob lutz its longtime designsavvy product chief now retired in his book car guys vs bean counters the battle for the soul of american business lutz writes about his fromthegut leadership style noting that he may have inadvertently set up gm for struggles after his retirement because he relied so much on my own will and my considerable influence gm executives and outside analysts say barras approach is diametrically different one that relies on teambuilding and seeks consensus she holds hall meetings to solicit advice on project direction she challenges engineers and designers to rethink their assumptions lutzs motto was often wrong never in doubt barras might be lets all figure this out together mary is trying to bring order to the business says john calabrese gms vice president of global vehicle engineering who has worked with barra in different capacities for  years shes very methodical very logical very fair she challenges the status quo pretty well shes provocative    shes an outstanding listener and i guess she kind of has a consensus approach but when its not coming together she gets concise and shes pretty decisive barra cultivates that image in the course of an interview in detroit for this article she deflects questions about her vision for the future of gms product line asked what imprint she hopes to leave on the company—what well say a mary barraera vehicle looks like—she demurs and talks about her team my job is to keep with the technology advancement so that the consumers are able to choose she says i want them to be able to choose what they drive because theres such a connection of how people pick vehicles of what they like so if we as a company have the right technology that allows us to deliver the fuel economy that is i think where the world is going yet still offer a range of size and products to meet peoples needs and wants thats how we win barra has no hesitation ticking off a list of challenges gm—and every carmaker—must confront automakers must develop and master advanced propulsion systems including electricpowered cars and trucks that can drive hundreds of miles without a charge and deliver handling and brawn on par with traditional gasoline engines engineers will need to safely integrate smart technology for drivers and infotainment for passengers the experience in the front seat is very different than the experience in the back seat barra says we have to understand that colleagues say barras understanding flows from her long and varied career at gm in person though its hard to shake the idea that her approach to the job started with her cousins red convertible —that she is at heart a car girl she has arrived for the interview in a black pantsuit her blouse open at the neck at  am she sips a diet coke from the can her smile is as warm and friendly as well a camaro which incidentally is not her daytoday car these days that would be a cadillac escalade a statussymbol favorite of pro athletes that barra chose largely for its carrying capacity her yearold son was until recently a hockey goalie a job that comes with a lot of gear barra seldom has time to take the escalade out for a cruise but she often looks forward to her minute commute really theres days when after a long day of work she says you get into your car and youre like this is fun i get to drive this home at least once a week she takes a vehicle in development out for a spin on a gm test track thanks to her son and her yearold daughter barra has been thinking lately about the challenge of designing cars for whats been dubbed the millennial generation these consumers—the children of baby boomers—often have lived a life without tradeoffs even more than their parents theyre not going to stomach the idea of sacrificing performance for economy theyre going to drive cars that under proposed federal fuel regulations will average  mpg and they will expect those cars to corner well go zero to  in a few ticks and incorporate all their favorite electronic toys if detroit wont sell them that some foreign competitor will like their mother barras children pine romantically for their first vehicles her daughter is saving up for a chevy equinox suv her son has been drawing cars since he was  recently barras husband ordered a new car surprise it was a camaro mother and father noticed the teenager doing some calculations in his head hey dad he said how about we get it in orange we had to tell him barra says the odds of you having the camaro when youre  probably are pretty small take heart kid you can get a used chevette these days for a song check

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans

specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no

earned it and i deserve it whether my hair is going to be blue or purple people should be judged on how well they do the job and deliver results and whether they do it the right way thats how i like to be judged most people are like that mary barra job blue hair if you do every job like youre going to do it for the rest of your life thats when you get noticed mary barra life job rest the biggest message i have for young women is dont start cutting off branches of your career tree unnecessarily early sometimes women say i know i want to have a family or play in the local symphony and they start pulling themselves out of their career path you dont have to take yourself out of the running before you even start mary barra family women path our goal is to make general motors the most valuable automotive company clearly that is having sustainable profitability and driving great returns for our shareholders mary barra great goal driving my definition of innovative is providing value to the customer mary barra value customer providing my parents were both born and raised in the depression they instilled great values about integrity and the importance of hard work and ive taken that with me to every job mary barra work hard work integrity what i always say is do every job youre in like youre going to do it for the rest of your life and demonstrate that ownership of it mary barra life job rest i started at general motors at  years old as a coop student at the general motors institute which is now kettering mary barra student now old my goal is for general motors to lead in safe autonomous driving mary barra goal driving lead the key with autonomous is the whole ecosystem one of the keys to having truly fully autonomous is vehicles talking to each other mary barra key talking ecosystem its a marathon not a sprint i actually feel like i come to work stronger when ive had a little time on the weekend to step away from it and enjoy my family and other things i come back energized if people think theyre going to work  week in and week out theyre not bringing their full strength to the table mary barra work family strength when you look at the truck market in north america you have to understand the customer and thats one of the things i think general motors does really well theres a big population that buys our trucks its their life  or its their livelihood not their lifestyle their livelihood its a work truck mary barra life work america i know were all addicted to our smartphones and ill say if i forget my smartphone i go home and get it and so understanding how to integrate that technology into the driving experience both the front seat and the passenger seat and the back seat i think is very important mary barra home technology experience my first job at general motors was as a quality inspector on the assembly line i was checking fits between hoods and fenders i had a little scale and clipboard at one point i was probably examining  jobs an hour during an eighthour shift a job like that teaches you to value all the people who do a job like that mary barra quality job value my advice on firing is simple treat that person the same way youd want to be treated if you were in that situation theyre still a good person just not the right fit so how do you help them move on in a productive way that allows them to maintain their dignity mary barra good simple good person a car is thirty thousand parts youre putting together mary barra car together you im a big believer of worklife balance you need a little down time to recharge to make sure that when youre here youre really all here i still have a child in high school so i go to her sporting events even if it means leaving work and working again when i get
