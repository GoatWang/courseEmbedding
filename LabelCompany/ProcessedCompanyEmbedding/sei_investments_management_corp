mediumterm horizon midcapmarketplaceindustrial insightssummaryfinancial technology is a great space to be in and sei is one of the stronger picks for those who are riskaversethe balance sheet is rock solid and thus far the company has avoided seeing drops in assets under management during a tough operating environmentsei is rolling out a new product platform to regions financial by the end of this year and to wells fargo by the end of next could be bigfinancial technology is a favored space of mine currently many companies here have seen stock prices remain restrained due to lingering association with beleaguered financials continued stringent regulation and other more nuanced sector headwinds active to passive investing shift etc unfortunately many of these companies do not get the coverage they deserve as it can be tough to understand both the products themselves and how they are being received by customers sei investments seic fits that mold perfectly given it has a great product suite that most outside the industry are not aware of is the value there for investors to build a stake in this company business overview sei provides investment processing management and operations solutions to larger clients like institutional investors financial advisors and ultrahigh net worth individuals broadly investors can view the company’s solutions as falling into three buckets investment processing investment management programs and investment operations most core is investment processing solutions which is made up of business process outsourcing “bpo” services as well as application and professional services directed towards commercial customers primary method of delivery is through the company’s two proprietary application suites trust  and the sei wealth platform the trust  platform is a comprehensive trust and investment accounting system that provides securities processing and accounting for trust accounts the sei wealth program is a scaleable platform designed to support wealth advisory and asset management functions revolving around encouraging a strong clientcentric relationship throughout this year sei has been converting two large bank clients wells fargo nysewfc regions nyserf to newer versions these installations are key as other potential core customers will be watching to make sure that the company’s products can handle these types of large customers regions financial is scheduled to be done within the next six months while wells fargo won’t be fully converted until the end of  once those projects roll off expenses will moderate which should provide a nice little tailwind to margins see management’s commentary from the most recent conference call we believe that from the develop standpoint thats generally peaked and its now plateauing and our goal would be as things like  as clients like regions settle in that some of that would start to come down post the installation of regions and then certainly an even bigger step down post the installation of wells fargo within investment management sei offers a multitude of fixed income equity and money market products primarily more niche etfs like sei multiasset accumulation simt or statespecific municipal bond funds like sei pennsylvania municipal bonds stet at the end of the last reported quarter sei had b in assets under management “aum” and another b in assets under administration “aua” aum relate to assets that sei directly manages investment direction in through its equity and fixed income investment programs while aua assets are those that the firm provides administrative services for unlike most other asset management firms trends in aum and aua have been positive for several years which is indicative of the healthy underlying strength in the firm’s investment strategies historical results valuation recent historical results have been extremely positive revenue growth has averaged  annually over the past two years driven by growth in both aum and aua sales to investment advisors and managers have seen the strongest growth in nearterm results while sales to private banks continue to lose their influence no growth despite being sei’s highest grossing end market overall growth has been stronger in aua which has put some minor pressure on margin  gaap operating margin in  versus  in  macro headwinds on margin aum fee contraction product mix pressure from large clients to cut costs likely has disguised some very strong incremental margin at sei there is likely very little cost to supporting new revenue so new contract wins are important to driving earnings q  was an excellent quarter in all these respects with revenue up  compared to the prior year period this was big and was one of the largest yy jumps in revenue in several quarters margins moved back in a positive direction and given the active buyback program second quarter diluted earnings per share increased  like most businesses in the financials space this is asset light and cash generation is quite high operational cash flow has expanded annually both from trends in net income and positive moves in working capital capital expenditures have been on the rise m in  to m in  but free cash flow has been solid assuming m in capital expenditures as a maintenance level free cash flow peaked at m last year or  free cash flow yield a large portion of this free cash flow has been dedicated to share buybacks and sei is on track to buy back another m worth of stock this year given the healthy net cash position m in cash no debt and resilient end markets there isn’t much to fear here it is a quality company with a rock solid balance sheet and that is going to attract a lot of riskaverse investors particularly institutions  of the float excluding insider shares is controlled by institutional investors at x trailing earnings the company isn’t particularly cheap but earnings are expected to grow measurably over the next two years as development expenses roll off and the company begins to build a little more scale with the company trading at x  earnings estimates there is a little bit of leeway here for price expansion given historical trading multiple norms but it is light  or so this one looks like a solid hold to me at current prices disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
