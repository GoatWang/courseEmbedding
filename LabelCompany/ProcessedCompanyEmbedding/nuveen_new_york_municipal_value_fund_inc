risk fixedincome securities such as bonds preferred convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates risecredit risk debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due  investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency however such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposessingle state concentration risk because the fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from a single state or us territories such as puerto rico the fund is more susceptible to adverse local economic political or regulatory changes affecting municipal bond issuers in those locations certain municipal bond issuers in puerto rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgradestax risk the tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the internal revenue service or state tax authoritiesinverse floater risk the fund invests in inverse floaters due to their leveraged nature these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk including counterparty credit risk in addition investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investmentcall risk or prepayment risk issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled forcing the fund to reinvest in loweryielding securitieshedging risk the fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful  derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount investedmunicipal bond market liquidity risk inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years either due to brokerdealer choices or to federal banking regulations reducing their ability to make a market in these securities this may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs particularly during periods of economic or market stress as a result the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired to sell other securities to raise cash or to give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on performance large block sales could further reduce bond prices

scroll to topthe exchangenuveen celebrates  years of investing in americainterview highlights anne kritzmiremd  head of closedend fund marketing tell us why you’re here todayso we’re here today to celebrate  years of nuveen closedend funds starting with nuv which was the largest ipo on the new york stock exchange at the time nuv is our oldest closedend fund it was launched to invest in municipal bonds along the way it’s built a whole lot of income for the shareholders while building many of americas essential public works through the municipal bonds the fund financed what should investors understand about how closedend funds workthe number one thing to understand about closedend funds is they’re mostly designed for income to provide regular cash flow whether you’re a retiree or somebody early in your career if you want that regular opportunity for income or investing the income then a closedend fund can be an important investment tool for you in addition unlike other funds that you may be familiar with they trade on the stock exchange throughout the day so you have those opportunities for visibility and liquidity and naming the price that you want to pay for the closedend fund share besides celebrating  years today what else is distinctive about nuvone of the things we’re really proud of for nuv our oldest fund is the idea that it has built income for the shareholders while building america for all of the rest of us over time this helped meaningfully grow our municipal bond franchise which now stands at more than  billion dollars – again by helping retail investors invest in america while receiving income along the way john miller md  cohead of fixed income i understand that the fund has been available for the past  years what do you consider the greatest contributors to that longevity i think it starts with the strength of the municipal asset class but in addition the product structure has been very beneficial to stability and monthly income over time active management and our deep fundamental research have also helped the fund succeed over three decades nuv was nuveen’s first muni closedend fund how has that suite grown since thenclosedend funds at nuveen have had incredible growth over the last  years we currently have  funds with total assets under management aum more than  billion when you combine the value of those funds so it has expanded across different parts of the yield curve different parts of the credit spectrum and different asset classes as well—all really with the foundation of having income produced by all those products how would you say that the closedend fund structure has enabled retail investors to invest in municipal bondsthe closedend fund structure helps retail investors in part because of the liquidity the ease of trading and the incremental approach to getting investors involved—this includes the amount that needs to be invested for an individual trade the information available and the diversification that comes from active professional management daniel close svp  portfolio manager thirty years ago nuveen launched its first nuveen municipal value fund what has been the primary goal of this fund our primary goal is income distribution so in the  years that nuv has been in existence its paid out  billion dollars in taxfree monthly distributions that relentless pursuit of income has been the goal of nuv and we’re happy to celebrate its year anniversary right now what would you consider to be the hallmarks of the nuveen municipal value fund the hallmark of nuv has been its consistency thirty years ago it launched at  a share and right now its trading at  a share—so over this  years it’s provided consistent monthly income to our shareholders what are some of the key projects supported by investments made by nuv nuv has supported key infrastructure projects throughout america every major airport built over the last  years – such as denver international airport the reconstruction of laguardia airport right now mccarran airport e – which is a  mile outer belt around denver – were all supported by nuv along with water and sewer projects like atlanta water where we just financed a  billion gallon reservoir for clean water how did it feel to ring the opening bell at the new york stock exchange it was absolutely fantastic it was one of the coolest events ive ever had so im super grateful the new york stock exchange you guys put on such a wonderful event thank you videonuveenbuilding income for shareholders while building americawatch now nuveen new york
