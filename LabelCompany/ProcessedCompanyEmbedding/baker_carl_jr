chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers when we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her her burnt chicken tenders they took  minutes when i was the only one at the restaurant i would not eat here again i usually look forward to carls jr on trips this one was a major disappointment bad lettuce cheese not melted on burgers tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully the meal tastes like a poor imitation luckily the fries were still good on our way home from visiting friends in vegas we stopped to get lunch in baker we sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for  minutes no one took our order the speaker must have been broke and finally the cars behind us backed out we followed do not recommend national franchise clean store food was as expected server was extremely friendly and efficient selfserve soda machines were out of order but i expect that they are getting them fixed not really much more to review ignore the  star rating i give this place  stars  stars this place is horrible horrible customer service horrible food rudest employees beware the drive thru i am not exaggerating we waited in the drive thru for mins once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is can you give us a couple of minutes absolutely ridiculous the food was good same as any other carls jr the restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention it was late in the day however on the way home from vegas we stopped at baker to get lunch to eat in the car the location was busy there were about  people ahead of us in line one cashier however the line moved fairly fast after ordering we got our food in about  minutes it was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda then it was back on the road towards home they got my burger correct only lettuce tomato and ketchup that doesnt always happen believe it or not service was good at carls jr ill be back if we are in the area to or from vegas xie xie review for drive thru only slowest drive thru ever must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order no comment as to food as i havent received it yet but  minutes and  cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside they should call it slow food theyre super nice here we ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce in case it wasnt juicy enough without it thank you this place is a mess tonight trash everywhere inside of the restaurant ac must be down because its hot inside the seating areaand no handsoap or towels inside the restroomswhich might mean the employees arent washing their hands when they use the facilities typically this place is better than this  much better todaytraveling back through and he place is perfect baker is fast food central most the big guys are there the king the colonel jack subway a alien jerky operation and some greek guy with a mental disorder wheres the damn clown no clown i love the clown and his golden arches then you got this place i had forgotten my contempt for carls jr i was lured in by the texas bbq thickburger propaganda false advertising i tried one today and it was horrible took two bites and threw it in the trash then i bought a crispy chicken sandwich with swiss and bacon better than the texas bbq shit sandwich but not by much the salt level burned my taste buds thanks for the sodium never going to a carls jr again visited on  july   since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic jason our cashier was professional and friendly facility was not packed and clean during our visit minus the  degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on what a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic bun boy has been replaced by a carls jr burger but i guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it  this would be a good one carls jr offers some fairly good burgers  even at the mouth of the mojave desert so if you are sick and tired of the gyros at the mad greek  come here  for curly fries a big carl and a shake terrible location i can get by without coke maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup however after waiting in a long line at the drive thru they tell me that they were out of fish as well i was like ok its monday i understand ill just have zucchinis with ranch sorry sir were out of ranch well what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in we have bbq and sweet and sour i asked him have u dipped zucchinis in bbq sauce no sir well wtf just over wall terrible experience especially when you cal rave for something and youre salivation for that taste just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker this place is dirty coffee and fountain area was dirty all the bins for the coffee empty and dirty used the womens room and this was dirty as well the wash basin has a grey look to it the stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing if i could give it no stars i would as i write this review im pissed because they are open at approximately pm yes i looked at the clock we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit carls jr we see the male employee inside scratching his hair  we pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark  my husband and i are like really we pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed he says hold on bro let me check we might can get you in he walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah were closed when clearly yelp said they were open as much business as i do in vegas i will never be a patron here fastfoodbully oh and i managed to get this typed before they closed what was i thinking coming here i cant rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided if the staff cant maintain the tables trash and soda area imaging the food place was dirty beyond anything ive ever seen fine dining in baker is limited baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from vegas carls jr is disappointing quality has gone down in decades especially at this location we walked in to order coming back from vegas of course i ordered my nostalgic western bacon cheeseburger combo with fries and drink the cashier said they were out of fries what the f still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries we were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also i opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing this location was semi clean not sure why it wasnt there were barely any customers i miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at carls jr if cal was around hed be disappointed i have to say this is a normal carls junior however its pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean it was really slow but staff was busy cleaning the food was fresh and warm typical carls junior my stars are mostly because it was very clean well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos our one year old needed to get out of the car i wasnt terrified letting her walk around the restraunt i got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night it was a welcomed surprise carl’s jr unclaimed this business has not yet been

big hamburger  not great not bad food was good service was fast lobby was clean slow af my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers when we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her her burnt chicken tenders they took  minutes when i was the only one at the restaurant i would not eat here again i usually look forward to carls jr on trips this one was a major disappointment bad lettuce cheese not melted on burgers tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully the meal tastes like a poor imitation luckily the fries were still good on our way home from visiting friends in vegas we stopped to get lunch in baker we sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for  minutes no one took our order the speaker must have been broke and finally the cars behind us backed out we followed do not recommend national franchise clean store food was as expected server was extremely friendly and efficient selfserve soda machines were out of order but i expect that they are getting them fixed not really much more to review ignore the  star rating i give this place  stars  stars this place is horrible horrible customer service horrible food rudest employees beware the drive thru i am not exaggerating we waited in the drive thru for mins once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is can you give us a couple of minutes absolutely ridiculous the food was good same as any other carls jr the restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention it was late in the day however on the way home from vegas we stopped at baker to get lunch to eat in the car the location was busy there were about  people ahead of us in line one cashier however the line moved fairly fast after ordering we got our food in about  minutes it was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda then it was back on the road towards home they got my burger correct only lettuce tomato and ketchup that doesnt always happen believe it or not service was good at carls jr ill be back if we are in the area to or from vegas xie xie review for drive thru only slowest drive thru ever must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order no comment as to food as i havent received it yet but  minutes and  cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside they should call it slow food theyre super nice here we ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce in case it wasnt juicy enough without it thank you this place is a mess tonight trash everywhere inside of the restaurant ac must be down because its hot inside the seating areaand no handsoap or towels inside the restroomswhich might mean the employees arent washing their hands when they use the facilities typically this place is better than this  much better todaytraveling back through and he place is perfect baker is fast food central most the big guys are there the king the colonel jack subway a alien jerky operation and some greek guy with a mental disorder wheres the damn clown no clown i love the clown and his golden arches then you got this place i had forgotten my contempt for carls jr i was lured in by the texas bbq thickburger propaganda false advertising i tried one today and it was horrible took two bites and threw it in the trash then i bought a crispy chicken sandwich with swiss and bacon better than the texas bbq shit sandwich but not by much the salt level burned my taste buds thanks for the sodium never going to a carls jr again visited on  july   since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic jason our cashier was professional and friendly facility was not packed and clean during our visit minus the  degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on what a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic bun boy has been replaced by a carls jr burger but i guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it  this would be a good one carls jr offers some fairly good burgers  even at the mouth of the mojave desert so if you are sick and tired of the gyros at the mad greek  come here  for curly fries a big carl and a shake terrible location i can get by without coke maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup however after waiting in a long line at the drive thru they tell me that they were out of fish as well i was like ok its monday i understand ill just have zucchinis with ranch sorry sir were out of ranch well what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in we have bbq and sweet and sour i asked him have u dipped zucchinis in bbq sauce no sir well wtf just over wall terrible experience especially when you cal rave for something and youre salivation for that taste just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker this place is dirty coffee and fountain area was dirty all the bins for the coffee empty and dirty used the womens room and this was dirty as well the wash basin has a grey look to it the stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing if i could give it no stars i would as i write this review im pissed because they are open at approximately pm yes i looked at the clock we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit carls jr we see the male employee inside scratching his hair  we pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark  my husband and i are like really we pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed he says hold on bro let me check we might can get you in he walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah were closed when clearly yelp said they were open as much business as i do in vegas i will never be a patron here fastfoodbully oh and i managed to get this typed before they closed what was i thinking coming here i cant rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided if the staff cant maintain the tables trash and soda area imaging the food place was dirty beyond anything ive ever seen fine dining in baker is limited baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from vegas carls jr is disappointing quality has gone down in decades especially at this location we walked in to order coming back from vegas of course i ordered my nostalgic western bacon cheeseburger combo with fries and drink the cashier said they were out of fries what the f still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries we were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also i opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing this location was semi clean not sure why it wasnt there were barely any customers i miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at carls jr if cal was around hed be disappointed i have to say this is a normal carls junior however its pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean it was really slow but staff was busy cleaning the food was fresh and warm typical carls junior my stars are mostly because it was very clean well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos our one year old needed to get out of the car i wasnt terrified letting her walk around the restraunt i got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night it was a welcomed surprise carl’s jr unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed by the owner or a representative claim this business to view business

food came out normal amount of time and was hot tasted like carls jr stopped on the way home too same kid working he had others this time helping but some want to be scary guy with last weeks food stuck in hes rancid beard was yelling at the poor kid over a breakfast burrito poor kid looked like he had been through this song and dance before i know people are heading home from a long weekend hung over broke or what ever but its food people they are doing their best this kid did better than that he even put up with me talking to someone while ordering the food came out wrong because of me i could complain but why there needs to be more positivity we went to carls jr we got carls jr the staff did their job the place was clean what more do you need clean lobby  bathrooms nice and very polite staff and good on the road food we ate there as a family after driving from disneyland and the food came out quick and hot i would stop here over any other place in town this carls jr was spotless i was very impressed to see if the employees werent helping with a customer they were cleaning all the employees were very nice and knowledgeable of the menu carls jr is located near the intersection of highway  and route  highway  is a major thoroughfare that takes you from barstow to lost wages route  is a lesstraveled backroads highway that takes you to the southern and eastern entrances of death valley national park i have visited death valley national park on six different weekends in the years  and found carls jr to be a welcome pit stop after a long day of hiking and photography i always order the carls jr santa fe chicken sandwich and typically i always pay extra for additional roasted green chiles because of the energydraining quality of hiking and doing photography for eight straight hours and because of their delicious nature i sometimes order two santa fe chicken sandwiches mmmm i do like them carls jr in baker ca is clean and has polite and serviceoriented cashiers i am also glad that carls jr in baker ca has good cell phone reception since i like to call my better half after completing my long day of exploring and hiking after my weekend desert photography weekends i have also gone to carls jr in ridgecrest ca and in joshua tree ca and always order santa fe chicken with extra roasted green chiles the mad greek an alternative to carls jr in baker ca is the mad greek the mad greek is also located at the same intersection of route  and route  but i think that one visit to the mad greek is enough the mad greek is distinguished by its amusing tacky decor plenty of faux greek statues but the cuisine is not perfect the dolmas are soggy and so i tend to opt for carls jr when returning home from death valley but once i stopped in barstow at a subway restaurant carls jr coffee also the coffee at carls jr is good the coffee is much better than that from starbucks blech yech ewww but not as good as the coffee from peets good coffee is important because it takes me six hours of driving at night to return home and generally im on the road until nearly midnight after my long days in the desert i have to say this is a normal carls junior however its pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean it was really slow but staff was busy cleaning the food was fresh and warm typical carls junior my stars are mostly because it was very clean well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos our one year old needed to get out of the car i wasnt terrified letting her walk around the restraunt i got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night it was a welcomed surprise we went there today and a wonderful nice girl made it nice now we just had drive they but she was so so nice she had beautiful eyelashes and tattoos very nice place to stop food was fresh service was perfect visited on  july   since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic jason our cashier was professional and friendly facility was not packed and clean during our visit minus the  degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on we moved to vegas  years ago and we stopped in baker very often and everything had a baker taste we have not stopped in over  years but today the freeway was at a standstill and found the fast food place with as many stars as possible and we were surprised when i say  stars it is  stars for baker i have said it before and i will say it again i love carls jr burgers i know most people prefer an innout but carls jr is where i go when i want a burger quick and conveniently still i would not normally give them a  star review this location is in baker we were here around sunset and it was eerily quiet and lots of crows spooky even the reasons this one gets a  star review the staff were friendly the place was clean the food was cooked perfectly the burgers didnt fall apart and when i went to throw out my cup they reminded me that i could get a refill to go they certainly went above and beyond expectations  for  real deal here great deal big hamburger  not great not bad food was good service was fast lobby was clean this place is a mess tonight trash everywhere inside of the restaurant ac must be down because its hot inside the seating areaand no handsoap or towels inside the restroomswhich might mean the employees arent washing their hands when they use the facilities typically this place is better than this  much better todaytraveling back through and he place is perfect what can i say its a carls jrhowever it was very cleanrestrooms includedi accidentally walked into the mens restroom the greeting we received from employee noe was great he was definitely happy to be there and working he was funny friendly and welcoming my breakfast biscuit was tasty and the coffee was fresh what else can you ask for the baker carls jr get  thumbs up on the way home from vegas we stopped at baker to get lunch to eat in the car the location was busy there were about  people ahead of us in line one cashier however the line moved fairly fast after ordering we got our food in about  minutes it was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda then it was back on the road towards home they got my burger correct only lettuce tomato and ketchup that doesnt always happen believe it or not service was good at carls jr ill be back if we are in the area to or from vegas xie xie tractor trailer parking clean restrooms  fresh food always ask for a fresh bun for your sandwich the sesame buns dont cut it  off for truckers big deal bring your coupons to make it count i dont know if it was the fact that i had driven for  miles prior to this carls jr or if they really are above the average jr but the famous star with cheese i had was delicious i doubt ill become a regular though with it being about  miles from home how can you hate on carls its the best fast food joint stand outside and smell charbroiled burgers cookin and youll be like damn this is a new location so its still clean and the bathrooms havent been tagged up yet clean place and very quick service ordered and served in  seconds chicken strips with bbq sauce was great friendly service greeted upon entry food brought to table after ordering at counter  they brought ketchup and ranch without even being askedsweet we stopped by this carls jr on a recent road trip my boy wanted the chicken stars so in we went we were greeted right away by the guy behind the counter even as he was helping another customer our first stop was to the restroom to wash hands and we found it to be well kept and well stocked the same guy who greeted us took our order he was very polite i so want to give him props but i never got around to reading the name on his badge overall food is typical we ordered a kids meal and a salad im so glad they didnt mess it up place is well kept it wasnt busy when we were there and it was pretty quiet inside with country music playing in the background before we left nice dude took our tray and trash from the table he even checked up on us during our meal anyway our visit there was on thursday march   around am the guy working there was super nice really

we sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for  minutes no one took our order the speaker must have been broke and finally the cars behind us backed out we followed do not recommend review for drive thru only slowest drive thru ever must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order no comment as to food as i havent received it yet but  minutes and  cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside they should call it slow food this place is dirty coffee and fountain area was dirty all the bins for the coffee empty and dirty used the womens room and this was dirty as well the wash basin has a grey look to it the stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing terrible location i can get by without coke maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup however after waiting in a long line at the drive thru they tell me that they were out of fish as well i was like ok its monday i understand ill just have zucchinis with ranch sorry sir were out of ranch well what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in we have bbq and sweet and sour i asked him have u dipped zucchinis in bbq sauce no sir well wtf just over wall terrible experience especially when you cal rave for something and youre salivation for that taste just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker ignore the  star rating i give this place  stars  stars this place is horrible horrible customer service horrible food rudest employees beware the drive thru i am not exaggerating we waited in the drive thru for mins once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is can you give us a couple of minutes absolutely ridiculous if i could give it no stars i would as i write this review im pissed because they are open at approximately pm yes i looked at the clock we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit carls jr we see the male employee inside scratching his hair  we pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark  my husband and i are like really we pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed he says hold on bro let me check we might can get you in he walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah were closed when clearly yelp said they were open as much business as i do in vegas i will never be a patron here fastfoodbully oh and i managed to get this typed before they closed god awful service for a fast food restaurant we waited  minutes in the drive thru with only one other car ahead of us what gives this is the wost experience ever empty resturant dirty and took forever to get our food slowest fast food ever i had time enough to get pissed download this app and write this comment and i still havent gotten food they served  customers in  minutes and i am still second in line i understand fresh but i could have sat down at a real restaurant and gotten my food by now what was i thinking coming here i cant rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided if the staff cant maintain the tables trash and soda area imaging the food place was dirty beyond anything ive ever seen bought a large  ice tea they were out and refused to make another batch i asked for my money back and the manager refused i asked then could i just buy a glass for water again no plus im sorry i dont think english was this persons first language and since it was slow i dont think customer service was either when i said im not drinking carbonated or sweetened beverages eventually another batch of unsweetened tea was made  minutes of drive time lost too disappointed doesnt even deserve the single star in one visit this happened the place is dirty the soda machine is empty the iced tea is empty the coffee is bad service is slow burger is soaked in mustard the shake was horribly made and much much more everything went wrong in a single visit baker is fast food central most the big guys are there the king the colonel jack subway a alien jerky operation and some greek guy with a mental disorder wheres the damn clown no clown i love the clown and his golden arches then you got this place i had forgotten my contempt for carls jr i was lured in by the texas bbq thickburger propaganda false advertising i tried one today and it was horrible took two bites and threw it in the trash then i bought a crispy chicken sandwich with swiss and bacon better than the texas bbq shit sandwich but not by much the salt level burned my taste buds thanks for the sodium never going to a carls jr again slow af my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers when we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her her burnt chicken tenders they took  minutes when i was the only one at the restaurant i would not eat here again i usually look forward to carls jr on trips this one was a major disappointment bad lettuce cheese not melted on burgers tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully the meal tastes like a poor imitation luckily the fries were still good fine dining in baker is limited baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from vegas carls jr is disappointing quality has gone down in decades especially at this location we walked in to order coming back from vegas of course i ordered my nostalgic western bacon cheeseburger combo with fries and drink the cashier said they were out of fries what the f still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries we were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also i opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing this location was semi clean not sure why it wasnt there were barely any customers i miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at carls jr if cal was around hed be disappointed coming back from a vegas trip we do our usual stop in baker as we walk in we are greeted by  large bags of trash left by the doorway then when trying to take an order the staff was busy goofing off and not really paying attention well this is just your average carls jr it looked ok and had the same quality that you expect from other carls jr stores the burgers we ordered were yummy and the fries were fresh the reason i gave this location  stars is because of the womens restroom this may sound bad but baker ca is a pit stop for almost everyone that passes through it for restroom

a major disappointment bad lettuce cheese not melted on burgers tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully the meal tastes like a poor imitation luckily the fries were still good on our way home from visiting friends in vegas we stopped to get lunch in baker we sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for  minutes no one took our order the speaker must have been broke and finally the cars behind us backed out we followed do not recommend national franchise clean store food was as expected server was extremely friendly and efficient selfserve soda machines were out of order but i expect that they are getting them fixed not really much more to review ignore the  star rating i give this place  stars  stars this place is horrible horrible customer service horrible food rudest employees beware the drive thru i am not exaggerating we waited in the drive thru for mins once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is can you give us a couple of minutes absolutely ridiculous the food was good same as any other carls jr the restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention it was late in the day however on the way home from vegas we stopped at baker to get lunch to eat in the car the location was busy there were about  people ahead of us in line one cashier however the line moved fairly fast after ordering we got our food in about  minutes it was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda then it was back on the road towards home they got my burger correct only lettuce tomato and ketchup that doesnt always happen believe it or not service was good at carls jr ill be back if we are in the area to or from vegas xie xie review for drive thru only slowest drive thru ever must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order no comment as to food as i havent received it yet but  minutes and  cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside they should call it slow food theyre super nice here we ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce in case it wasnt juicy enough without it thank you this place is a mess tonight trash everywhere inside of the restaurant ac must be down because its hot inside the seating areaand no handsoap or towels inside the restroomswhich might mean the employees arent washing their hands when they use the facilities typically this place is better than this  much better todaytraveling back through and he place is perfect baker is fast food central most the big guys are there the king the colonel jack subway a alien jerky operation and some greek guy with a mental disorder wheres the damn clown no clown i love the clown and his golden arches then you got this place i had forgotten my contempt for carls jr i was lured in by the texas bbq thickburger propaganda false advertising i tried one today and it was horrible took two bites and threw it in the trash then i bought a crispy chicken sandwich with swiss and bacon better than the texas bbq shit sandwich but not by much the salt level burned my taste buds thanks for the sodium never going to a carls jr again visited on  july   since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic jason our cashier was professional and friendly facility was not packed and clean during our visit minus the  degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on what a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic bun boy has been replaced by a carls jr burger but i guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it  this would be a good one carls jr offers some fairly good burgers  even at the mouth of the mojave desert so if you are sick and tired of the gyros at the mad greek  come here  for curly fries a big carl and a shake terrible location i can get by without coke maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup however after waiting in a long line at the drive thru they tell me that they were out of fish as well i was like ok its monday i understand ill just have zucchinis with ranch sorry sir were out of ranch well what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in we have bbq and sweet and sour i asked him have u dipped zucchinis in bbq sauce no sir well wtf just over wall terrible experience especially when you cal rave for something and youre salivation for that taste just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker this place is dirty coffee and fountain area was dirty all the bins for the coffee empty and dirty used the womens room and this was dirty as well the wash basin has a grey look to it the stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing if i could give it no stars i would as i write this review im pissed because they are open at approximately pm yes i looked at the clock we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit carls jr we see the male employee inside scratching his hair  we pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark  my husband and i are like really we pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed he says hold on bro let me check we might can get you in he walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah were closed when clearly yelp said they were open as much business as i do in vegas i will never be a patron here fastfoodbully oh and i managed to get this typed before they closed what was i thinking coming here i cant rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided if the staff cant maintain the tables trash and soda area imaging the food place was dirty beyond anything ive ever seen fine dining in baker is limited baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from vegas carls jr is disappointing quality has gone down in decades especially at this location we walked in to order coming back from vegas of course i ordered my nostalgic western bacon cheeseburger combo with fries and drink the cashier said they were out of fries what the f still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries we were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also i opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing this location was semi clean not sure why it

slow af my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers when we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her her burnt chicken tenders they took  minutes when i was the only one at the restaurant i would not eat here again i usually look forward to carls jr on trips this one was a major disappointment bad lettuce cheese not melted on burgers tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully the meal tastes like a poor imitation luckily the fries were still good on our way home from visiting friends in vegas we stopped to get lunch in baker we sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for  minutes no one took our order the speaker must have been broke and finally the cars behind us backed out we followed do not recommend national franchise clean store food was as expected server was extremely friendly and efficient selfserve soda machines were out of order but i expect that they are getting them fixed not really much more to review ignore the  star rating i give this place  stars  stars this place is horrible horrible customer service horrible food rudest employees beware the drive thru i am not exaggerating we waited in the drive thru for mins once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is can you give us a couple of minutes absolutely ridiculous the food was good same as any other carls jr the restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention it was late in the day however on the way home from vegas we stopped at baker to get lunch to eat in the car the location was busy there were about  people ahead of us in line one cashier however the line moved fairly fast after ordering we got our food in about  minutes it was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda then it was back on the road towards home they got my burger correct only lettuce tomato and ketchup that doesnt always happen believe it or not service was good at carls jr ill be back if we are in the area to or from vegas xie xie review for drive thru only slowest drive thru ever must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order no comment as to food as i havent received it yet but  minutes and  cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside they should call it slow food theyre super nice here we ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce in case it wasnt juicy enough without it thank you this place is a mess tonight trash everywhere inside of the restaurant ac must be down because its hot inside the seating areaand no handsoap or towels inside the restroomswhich might mean the employees arent washing their hands when they use the facilities typically this place is better than this  much better todaytraveling back through and he place is perfect baker is fast food central most the big guys are there the king the colonel jack subway a alien jerky operation and some greek guy with a mental disorder wheres the damn clown no clown i love the clown and his golden arches then you got this place i had forgotten my contempt for carls jr i was lured in by the texas bbq thickburger propaganda false advertising i tried one today and it was horrible took two bites and threw it in the trash then i bought a crispy chicken sandwich with swiss and bacon better than the texas bbq shit sandwich but not by much the salt level burned my taste buds thanks for the sodium never going to a carls jr again visited on  july   since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic jason our cashier was professional and friendly facility was not packed and clean during our visit minus the  degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on what a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic bun boy has been replaced by a carls jr burger but i guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it  this would be a good one carls jr offers some fairly good burgers  even at the mouth of the mojave desert so if you are sick and tired of the gyros at the mad greek  come here  for curly fries a big carl and a shake terrible location i can get by without coke maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup however after waiting in a long line at the drive thru they tell me that they were out of fish as well i was like ok its monday i understand ill just have zucchinis with ranch sorry sir were out of ranch well what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in we have bbq and sweet and sour i asked him have u dipped zucchinis in bbq sauce no sir well wtf just over wall terrible experience especially when you cal rave for something and youre salivation for that taste just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker this place is dirty coffee and fountain area was dirty all the bins for the coffee empty and dirty used the womens room and this was dirty as well the wash basin has a grey look to it the stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing if i could give it no stars i would as i write this review im pissed because they are open at approximately pm yes i looked at the clock we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit carls jr we see the male employee inside scratching his hair  we pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark  my husband and i are like really we pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed he says hold on bro let me check we might can get you in he walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah were closed when clearly yelp said they were open as much business as i do in vegas i will never be a patron here fastfoodbully oh and i managed to get this typed before they closed what was i thinking coming here i cant rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided if the staff cant maintain the tables trash and soda area imaging the food place was dirty beyond anything ive ever seen fine dining in baker is limited baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from vegas carls jr is disappointing quality has gone down in decades especially at this location we walked in to order coming back from vegas of course i ordered my nostalgic western
