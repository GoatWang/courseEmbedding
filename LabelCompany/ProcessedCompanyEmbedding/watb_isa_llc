produced through a limited liability company commonly referred to as an llc or an s corporation is much like selling a product of any corporation or company s corporation and llc designations are business incorporation categories applied for through the us internal revenue service which grants certain tax provisions to the individuals and companies that hold them for best results a sales professional should gain a comprehensive understanding of the internal structure of these types of companies before selling their products  find out the sales goals and objectives of the s corporation shareholders or llc members the main defining trait of an s corporation is that the company passes all corporate finances through its shareholders for tax purposes this includes corporate income losses credit and tax deductions the shareholders in turn report the finances on their personal tax returns thereby paying individual income tax rates rather than corporate rates an llc company’s owners also known as members have a limited personal liability for the financial performance of their company because of these internal structures and the nature of personal financial planning most s corporation shareholders and many llc members will want to have input on the sales objectives of its company  conduct market research by learning about the products and services offered by the company’s competition this can be accomplished by making a list of all similar product and service providers and learning about the specifics of their products price points and market saturation information is typically available through local consumer economic and market research institutions and through publications  develop a sales and marketing plan based on the sales objectives of s corporation shareholders or llc members the plan should include an advertising budget and a recommendation for the best media outlets to utilize for promotional purposes  create advertisements that reach the target customer demographic you determined during your market research develop a timetable for placing the ads with your selected media such as television internet billboard and print publications  make appointments to meet with large potential clients in person to discuss your product bring a sample of the product when possible and offer inperson demonstrations outline how the s

citizens or permanent residents legal protection owners have limited liability for business debts and obligations enhanced credibility partners suppliers and lenders may look more favorably on your business when youve formed an llc compare llcs and corporations with our business comparison chart disadvantages of an llc creating an llc is an attractive option but there are a few hurdles limited growth potential you cannot issue shares of stock to attract investors lack of uniformity llcs can be treated differently in different states selfemployment tax earnings can be subject to this kind of taxation tax recognition on appreciated assets this could happen if you convert an existing business to an llc one more way that extra taxation can occur is creating an llc right for me that really depends on what your shortterm and longterm business goals are we recommend that you put some thought into where your business is now and how you want your business to grow before deciding whether the llc structure is right for you how to form an llc limited liability company choose a legal name and reserve it if the secretary of state in your state does that sort of thing not all do draft and file your articles of incorporation with your secretary of state decide who will run the business managers or members decide how many owners are in the business apply for a business license and other certificates specific to your industry file form ss or apply online at the internal revenue service website to obtain an employer identification number ein apply for any other id numbers required by state and local government agencies requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another but generally your business most likely will be required to pay unemployment disability and other payroll taxes –

do i need to do to maintain my llc can i use incorporatecom as a registered agent if i buy a package but want to customize and add services is that possible i need additional help – can you give me more guidance i had some legal questions come up can you assist how does forming an llc help protect my personal assets unlike sole proprietorships and partnerships llcs allow their owners to separate and protect their personal assets from business debts and liabilities a sole proprietor or general partner remains personally liable for business obligations leaving their home car and personal savings at risk in contrast forming an llc creates a business structure separate from its owners in a properly formed and managed llc only business assets remain at risk in a judgment against the company owners can protect their personal savings and possessions from business debts back to top how are llc profits taxed like a sole proprietorship or partnership an llc enjoys passthrough taxation this means that owners also known as members report their share of profits or losses in the company on their individual tax returns the internal revenue service irs does not assess taxes on the company itself this avoids the double taxation that general or c corporations experience in a c corporation the irs taxes profits at the corporate level and dividends at the shareholder level when creating an llc owners need not distribute profits and losses in the llc in proportion to ownership pursuant to irs guidelines the owners of an llc can agree to allocate the companys profits and losses among themselves however they see fit not necessarily based on the percentage of the company each owner controls back to top how does an llc compare to a c corporation for many small business owners a limited liability company llc offers advantages over a c corporation also known as a general corporation creating an llc combines the tax advantages of a sole proprietorship or partnership with the liability protection of a corporation the irs taxes the profits of a c corporation at corporate tax rates then if the c corporation pays dividends to shareholders the irs taxes those dividends a second time at the personal income tax rates of the shareholders the llc business structure avoids this double taxation the internal revenue service irs does not consider an llc itself a taxable entity instead the companys earnings pass through to the owners who report their share of profits or losses on their individual tax returns small business owners who want the flexible structure of an llc but the advantages of corporate taxation can elect corporate taxation for their llc to elect corporate taxation owners file form  tax classification election with the irs electing this status may also make an llc eligible for certain deductions available only to corporations for specific guidance small business owners should consult their accountant or tax advisor regarding this election back to top how does an llc compare to an s corporation the limited liability company llc and the subchapter s corporation s corp share the benefit of passthrough taxation this means

limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook a limited liability company llc offers protection from personal liability for business debts just like a corporation however unlike a corporation which must pay its own taxes an llc is a passthrough tax entity the profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship moreover while setting up an llc is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship running one is significantly easier than running a corporation here are the main features of an llc limited personal liability like shareholders of a corporation all llc owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims this means that if the business itself cant pay a creditor  such as a supplier a lender or a landlord  the creditor cannot legally come after an llc members house car or other personal possessions because only llc assets are used to pay off business debts llc owners stand to lose only the money that theyve invested in the llc this feature is often called limited liability exceptions to limited liability while llc owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions this protection is not absolute this drawback is not unique to llcs however  the same exceptions apply to corporations an llc owner can be held personally liable if he or she personally and directly injures someone personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the llc defaults fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees wages intentionally does something fraudulent illegal or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else or treats the llc as an extension of his or her personal affairs rather than as a separate legal entity this last exception is the most important if owners dont treat the llc as a separate business a court might decide that the llc doesnt really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts to keep this from happening make sure you and your coowners act fairly and legally do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors creditors or other outsiders fund your llc adequately invest enough cash in the business so that your llc can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities keep llc and personal business separate get a federal employer identification number open up a businessonly checking account and keep your personal finances out of your llc accounting books create an operating agreement having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your llcs separate existence for more on this see nolos article the llc operating agreement for more information on llc limited liability protection and the differences in state laws see  llcs and limited  liability  what protection do you get   additional protection business insurance a good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not for instance if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a clients back your liability insurance policy should cover you insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court in addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations insurance can protect the llcs assets from lawsuits and claims but your llc wont be protected if it doesnt pay its bills commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts whether or not theyre personally guaranteed for more information on insurance see nolos article obtaining small business insurance llc taxes unlike a corporation an llc is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes instead it is what the irs calls a passthrough entity like a partnership or sole proprietorship this means that business income passes through the business to the llc members who report their share of profits  or losses  on their individual income tax returns each llc member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs while an llc itself doesnt pay taxes coowned llcs must file form 0 an informational return with the irs each year this form which partnerships also have to file sets out each llc members share of the llcs profits or losses which the irs reviews to make sure llc members are correctly reporting their income for more information on llc taxes see nolos article how llcs are taxed llc management the owners of most small llcs participate equally in the management of their business this arrangement is called member management there is an alternative management structure  somewhat awkwardly called manager management  in which you designate one or more owners or even an outsider to take responsibility for managing the llc the nonmanaging owners sometimes family members who have invested in the company simply sit back and share in llc profits in a managermanaged llc only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the llc choosing manager management sometimes makes sense but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities for more information see nolos limited liability company llc faq forming an llc to create an llc you file articles of organization in some states called a certificate of organization or certificate of formation with the llc division of your state government this office is often in the same department as the corporations division which is usually part of the secretary of states office filing fees range from about 00 to  now in every state you can  form an llc with just one person many states supply a blank onepage form for the articles of organization on which you need only specify a few basic details about your llc such as its name and address and contact information for a person involved with the llc usually called a registered agent who will receive legal papers on its behalf some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the llc members in addition to filing articles of organization you must create a written llc operating agreement you dont have to file your operating agreement with the state but that doesnt mean you can get by without one the operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the llc members rights and responsibilities their percentage interests in the business and their share of the profits to learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an llc

under the laws of many states unless your operating agreement says otherwise when one member wants to leave the llc the company dissolves in that case the llc members must fulfill any remaining business obligations pay off all debts divide any assets and profits among themselves and then decide whether they want to start a new llc to continue the business with the remaining members your llc operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including buysell or buyout provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires dies becomes disabled or leaves the llc to pursue other interests for more information see nolos article plan ahead for llc ownership changes share on google plus share on facebook talk to a lawyer need help start
