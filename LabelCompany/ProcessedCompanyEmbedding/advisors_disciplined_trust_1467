investment trust investments unit investment trusts are formed when a trust sponsor puts together a portfolio of securities and then offers share units of the trust through brokers and investment houses the uit portfolio holds the initial securities until the termination date of the trust  typically a uit will have a termination date a date when the uit will terminate and dissolve that is established when the uit is created although some may terminate more than fifty years after they are created  the basic rules of uits are governed by  usc § a– a uit does not actively trade its investment portfolio that is a uit buys a relatively fixed portfolio of securities for example five ten or twenty specific stocks or bonds and holds them with little or no change for the life of the uit  this can be risky if the market moves against the portfolio  unlike a more actively managed investment like a mutual fund a uit portfolio that is not well positioned for the current market climate can be poised for substantial losses this is exactly the current risk of long duration bond uits and municipal bond unit investment trusts a bond unit trust is an investment in a fixed diversified group of professionally selected municipal or corporate bonds as a unitholder of a bond unit trust you own a portion of every bond held in the trust  if the portfolio is comprised primarily of long duration bonds when interest rates rise as they are right now the underlying value of the bonds will decrease substantially unit investment trusts are strictly broker sold products and there is not an active secondary market for the units the low visibility of uit returns makes the rating of unit investment trusts difficult   additionally uits one of the highest commission products sold by a financial advisor often explaining the broker’s motivation in selling a uit as opposed to a basket of municipal or corporate bonds uits are also high cost investments saddled with hefty transaction fees incurred both when the unit is first purchased and again when the unit dissolves  investors are often charged initial sales charges deferred sales charges creation and development fees and organization cost fees financial advisors have three basic responsibilities to their clients – to disclose the risks features of any investment to perform adequate due diligence on any investment that they recommend and to only recommend investments that are appropriate for the client in light of that client’s age investment experience risk tolerance and net worth before recommending a bond unit investment trust investment a financial advisor at minimum is required to disclose  the uits current price  the commissions or markups that must be paid to acquire the uit  the current yield the yield to maturity and the yield to call the bonds being help in the trust  the amount and timing of the bond payments and most importantly  the risk of default or devaluation of the particular bonds held in the trust in today’s interest rate climate a financial advisor must also make the investor fully aware of the uits interest rate risk – ie the risk that the value of the bond portfolio held by the trust could decrease if interest rates increase given the current interest rate climate the following uits among others have interest rate risk that may result in losses to
