 explore your mutual fund options today book an appointment visit a branch at a time thats convenient to you by phone    mutual funds  whether you’re just considering investing or have already established a diversified portfolio here’s some information about mutual funds you may find helpful   collapse what is your investment risk tolerance one of the basic principals of investing is that the more money you want to make the more risk you need to be willing to take this is called the “riskreturn tradeoff” what it means is that a mutual fund with a lot of growth potential is subject to the fluctuations in the market so someone with a high risk tolerance could stand to make or lose a lot of money depending on the performance of their mutual fund investments the best way to understand the riskreturn tradeoff is to speak with a mutual funds representative they guide you through the customer investor profile questionnaire that will help define your investing objectives and your tolerance to risk once they understand what you want from your mutual fund investments they will be able to recommend a mutual fund or mutual fund portfolio that is suitable for your needs   expand what makes a portfolio low risk or high risk the amount of risk associated with an investment portfolio is determined by the types of assets held risk can also be associated with the growth potential of a portfolio for example in the graph above portfolio a is composed entirely of bonds which over time experienced both a low annual return – or growth – and low risk this is because bonds represent funds borrowed by a company or government in exchange for a predetermined interest rate and guaranteed return of the principal by the borrower there is very little risk involved unless that company or government goes bankrupt a stock is an individual share in a company stocks – also referred to as “equities”  are traded on exchanges all over the world and therefore are subject to the dips and rises in the stock market portfolio b is composed exclusively of equities which over time experienced high risk and high growth when a mutual fund portfolio includes a mixture of stocks and bonds you benefit from diversification across these two asset classes portfolio c is composed of  bonds and  equities this portfolio actually experienced lower risk than portfolio a  bonds and had a higher return portfolio d split the portfolio investing  in bonds and  in equities while it experienced more risk than portfolio a or c it also got a much higher return as a result as you can see there are many options in how you can assemble your mutual fund portfolio a mutual funds representative with td investment services inc will work with you to determine your investment goals and risk tolerance and then recommend the most appropriate mix of assets for you   expand why is a broad range of investments better mutual funds spread your money out across many investment types this investment strategy is called diversification diversification helps you minimize your risk because you aren’t putting all your eggs in one basket you may also benefit from greater return potential so with a mutual fund your money is no longer dependent on the performance of a single investment but instead is an average of the entire collection of investments that way if one stock or bond – or other asset – in a mutual fund portfolio performs poorly other wellperforming holdings within the mutual fund’s portfolio help offset any losses the same can be true when investing in more than one type of mutual fund to complete a wellbalanced investment portfolio one of the best ways to diversify your portfolio is to invest among the three main asset classes money market bonds equities since asset classes tend to move independently of one another positive performance in one asset class can help offset negative performance in another for mutual fund investors a diversified portfolio would include a combination of money market funds for safety bond and mortgage funds for income and equity mutual funds for potential dividend income and longterm capital growth   expand take advantage of global opportunities another important way to diversify your portfolio is by investing in different countries around the world often certain areas of the global economy are performing better than others in addition there are industries that may be better represented in other part of the globe then they are here at home by spreading your investments throughout the world you reduce your overall portfolio risk while at the same time increasing your longterm growth potential   expand a long time horizon can reduce your risk whether you are investing in a bond or equity they are all subject to fluctuations in market value over longer periods of time however returns tend to average out and stabilize therefore staying invested longer helps to reduce your risk and improve your potential for higher returns   expand benefit from dollarcost averaging if you can contribute to your mutual fund on a regular basis not only are you steadily growing your investment you are saving money while doing so if you set up a preauthorized purchase plan you are investing a fixed amount to your fund at regular intervals this strategy called dollarcost averaging lets you buy more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high while it doesn’t guarantee a profit or help protect you against a loss it can result in a lower average unit cost over time for example let’s say you have  a month to invest in a particular fund that fluctuates in price january price   – you buy  units february price   – you buy  units march price   – you buy  units in three months you have invested  and purchased  units with an average cost per unit of only 9 best of all when you set up a td comfort portfolio a portfolio manager does all the work for you so all you have to do is set up a preauthorized purchase plan and enjoy the savings in order to set up a preauthorized purchase plan you must meet a  initial purchase minimum explore your mutual fund options today book an appointment

gics mutual funds can offer an easy way to tap into potentially greater returns and help you reach your longerterm savings goals such as retirement td offers solutions for every investor type whether you’re seeking security income growth or a balance of all three and it takes only  to get started     what does it cost to invest mutual fund costs are typically expressed as a management expense ratio or mer the fund costs that make up the mer are not charged to investors directly rather the mer is reflected in the net return of a fund mers vary depending on the type of fund and how actively managed it is for example index funds generally have very low mers that’s because they are passively managed — the fund manager simply matches a market index with actively managed funds however the fund manager buys and sells securities seeking to outperform the index backed by a team of researchers and analysts fund managers stay on top of market opportunities looking for ways to maximize returns while mitigating risk and making investment decisions on behalf of all fund investors     the value behind the mer most of the fees you pay are used to cover the cost of managing the fund when you choose td mutual funds expertise is built right into every fund you get professional fund management td mutual funds are managed by td asset management inc tdam one of canada’s largest fund

to management fees some — but not all — mutual funds charge sales commissions or “loads” funds that don’t have these charges are called “noload” funds mutual funds that do charge them fall into two

performance may not be repeated however fund managers and the funds themselves operate under strict securities regulations for example mutual funds are owned by the unitholders people who own the mutual fund and are separate legal entities from the companies that operate them securities legislation also requires that mutual fund assets be held in trust by a custodian on behalf of unitholders   expand what types of funds are available you can choose funds that invest in money market investments such as government issued treasury bills income investments such as bonds or equity investments such as stocks of corporations both domestic and international some funds are broadly diversified while others target an asset class or a specific sector of the economy such as international bonds or

hundreds of choices each mutual fund will fall into one of the three main asset classes safety income or growth or you can choose a balanced fund which is actively managed to maintain a mix of various

redemption fee is payable to all funds except money market funds if you transfer or sell units of these funds within  days  days for td eseries of purchase this fee is designed to protect unitholders from the costs associated with other investors moving quickly in and out of the funds frequent trading can hurt a funds performance by forcing the portfolio manager to keep more cash in the fund than would otherwise be needed or to sell investments at an inappropriate time it may also increase a funds transaction costs   expand where can i buy mutual funds mutual funds are sold through registered

mutual funds through td investment services inc by contacting a mutual funds representative through easyline telephone services easyweb internet access or by visiting any any td canada trust branchyou can also purchase td mutual funds through td direct investing and td wealth   expand what about taxes net income and net realized capital gains earned by a mutual fund are generally passed on to investors in the form of distributions the frequency of distributions will vary depending on the mutual fund but will generally be monthly quarterly or annually you can also earn a capital gain when you sell your mutual fund or switch from one mutual fund to another at a price higher than you paid the tax treatment of distributions received or capital gains realized will depend upon the type of account in which you hold the investment if you hold a mutual fund in a registered plan such as an rsp rif resp or tfsa distributions paid by a mutual fund and any capital gains realized are generally sheltered from tax any amount you withdraw from a registered plan excluding a tfsa is generally fully taxable amounts withdrawn from a tfsa are not taxable if you hold a mutual fund in a nonregistered account distributions paid by the mutual fund are taxable whether they are received in cash or reinvested into the mutual fund you will receive a t supplementaryrelevé  tax slip which will tell you the amount and type of income to report on your tax return you must also include in your taxable income any capital gains realized from selling or switching your mutual fund its up to you to calculate and report the capital gains you realize on your transactions although an official tax slip is not required mutual fund companies are required to report all sales or switches to canada revenue agency   expand what is the difference between book value and average cost per unit book value is the original cost of purchases and reinvested distributions minus the average cost of any redemptions average cost per unit is used to calculate any capital gains or losses you may earn when you sell or transfer units of a fund you hold in a nonregistered account the average cost per unit is the book value of your fund divided by the number of units you hold   expand what is the difference between global and international funds technically speaking theres a difference between a global fund and an international fund from a north american perspective a global fund may invest in all the markets of the world including north america whereas an international fund generally excludes north america   expand how do i compare different funds while past performance does not guarantee future growth annualized returns for different periods eg year years years  years are often used to compare funds and the quality of their management most major daily newspapers publish mutual funds performance tables each month for periods ranging from one month to  years or more comparing a fund with others in its peer group is a good way to evaluate past performance mutual fund tables make it easy by grouping similar funds together the ability to consistently outperform its peers is one sign of a goodquality fund to make a fair comparison it is important to recognize that all funds in one category are not the same for example some canadian equity funds are managed conservatively while others aggressively pursue growth one fund manager may emphasize longerterm value while another may actively trade investment positions at different times in the market cycle if in doubt find out from the fund company the simplified prospectus or the fund facts sheet what the funds investment objectives are and how the fund is managed while some performance numbers can be very attractive you may discover that the funds investments are too risky for you   expand how does tdam discourage market timing while market timing is not illegal our funds are designed for longterm mutual fund investors tdam started to charge an early redemption fee erf for most td mutual funds many years ago this  fee is applied to investors that buy and sell units of the same fund within  or  days thus discouraging for market timing the amount charged by this process is paid to the fund to cover any costs or possible negative impact to the fund or its unitholders in addition we also retain the right to reject purchase orders from a unitholder who is conducting any activity considered detrimental to the funds or its unitholders at td mutual funds we are committed to protecting the best interests of our unitholders
