trust that is registered under the investment company act of  as amended the  act as a nondiversified closedend management investment company investment program    the fund seeks longterm capital growth by investing substantially all its assets in investment funds investment funds managed by a range of unaffiliated thirdparty investment managers investment managers specializing in alternative investment strategies the investment managers employ a variety of investment strategies including but not limited to hedging distressed securities event driven and relativevalue arbitrage and special situations alternative investment strategies allow investment managers the flexibility to use leveraged or shortsale positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across the global capital markets these strategies are in contrast to the investment programs of traditional registered investment companies such as mutual funds traditional investment companies are generally characterized by longonly investments and limits on the use of leverage because investment funds pursuing alternative investment strategies whether hedged or unhedged are often described as hedge funds the funds investment program can be broadly referred to as a fund of hedge funds the investment objective of the fund is fundamental and may only be changed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities as defined in the  act of the fund    investment funds are commingled asset pools that engage primarily in the alternative investment strategies described above among other things investment funds invest primarily in us and nonus equity and debt securities and may engage in leverage short selling and derivative transactions investment funds typically offer their securities privately without registration under the securities act of  as amended the  act in large minimum denominations often at least  million to a limited number of high net worth individual and institutional investors investment funds are excluded from the definition of investment company and hence are not registered as investment companies under the  act the managers or investment advisers of these investment funds are usually compensated through both assetbased fees and incentivebased feesallocations the fund does not follow a rigid asset allocation policy but instead invests in a combination of investment funds utilizing a range of strategies the adviser as hereinafter defined attempts to select individual investment managers that offer a variety of different strategies in an effort to further balance the funds portfolio and to provide for opportunities for capital growth some of the investment funds selected by the adviser may have investment managers that use leverage as a material component of their overall trading strategy    the fund may seek to gain investment exposure to certain investment funds to adjust market or risk exposure or to increase overall returns by seeking leveraged market exposure in certain investments by entering into derivative transactions such as total return swaps options and futures for example to achieve investment returns equivalent to those achieved by an investment manager in whose investment fund the fund could not invest directly perhaps because of its high investment minimum or its unavailability for direct investment the fund may enter into one or more swap agreements under which the fund may agree on a net basis to pay a return based on a floating interest rate and to receive the total return of the reference investment fund over a stated time period see types of investments and related risks  special investment instruments and techniques  futures contracts  options trading and  swap agreements the fund may incur leveraged exposure through its investments in derivatives which may in some circumstances involve significant risks of loss and may increase the volatility of the funds returns these risks may increase dramatically during times where general access to credit is severely impaired ie a credit crunch andor during general market turmoil such as that experienced during late  see types of investments and related risks  investment related risks  leverage utilized by the fund    the adviser is responsible for the allocation of assets to various investment funds subject to policies adopted by the funds board of trustees these investment funds will have investors other than the fund    the adviser allocates fund assets among the investment funds that in its view represent attractive investment opportunities allocation depends on the advisers assessment of the likely risks and returns of the investment strategies that the investment funds utilize and the likely correlation among the investment funds under consideration the adviser generally seeks to invest substantially all of the funds assets in investment funds whose expected riskadjusted returns are deemed attractive the adviser periodically reallocates the funds investments among investment funds in order to increase the funds expected riskadjusted return there is no guarantee that the fund will be able to avoid substantial losses due to poor returns by any investment fund or that the advisers expectations regarding investment funds limited correlations among each other or with fixed income or equity indices will prove correct         the adviser employs a multimanager approach and invests in a wide variety of investment funds managed by investment managers specializing in different alternative investment strategies the adviser attempts to select individual investment managers that offer a variety of different skills in an effort to further balance the funds investment portfolio and to maximize opportunities for capital growth the adviser considers a number of factors in selecting investment managers including the investment managers basic investment strategy and policies reputation prior performance use of fundamental analysis and other analytical methods use of leverage and other techniques and trading acumen on an ongoing basis the adviser conducts similar periodic reviews with respect to investment funds in which the fund has invested    the adviser typically endeavors to limit investments in any one investment fund to no more than  of the funds gross assets measured at the time of purchase and to limit investments in any one investment manager to no more than  of the funds gross assets measured at the time of purchase the adviser limits fund investments in any one investment fund to less than  of an investment funds outstanding voting securities see types of investments and related risks 

fund has elected and intends to qualify to be treated as a regulated investment company a ric under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code to qualify as a ric under the code the fund must among other things i derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined in the code and ii diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of each taxable year a at least  of the market value of the funds assets is represented by cash cash items us government securities securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities with such other securities of any one issuer limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than  of the value of the funds total assets and  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and b not more than  of the market value of

political conditions the fund may invest temporarily in high quality fixed income securities money market instruments and money market funds or may hold cash or cash equivalents for temporary defensive purposes in addition the fund may also make these types of investments pending the investment of assets in investment funds or to maintain the liquidity necessary to effect repurchases of shares and pay fund expenses leverage    the fund may borrow money in connection with its investment activities  ie the fund may utilize leverage specifically the fund may borrow money through a credit facility or other arrangements to manage timing issues in connection with the acquisition of its investments ie to provide the fund with temporary liquidity to acquire investments in investment funds in advance of the funds receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more investment funds or the receipt of proceeds from the sale of additional shares the fund also may borrow money to fund repurchase payments to shareholders pending the receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more investment funds    the  act requires a registered investment company to satisfy an asset coverage requirement of  of its indebtedness including amounts borrowed measured at the time the investment company incurs the indebtedness the asset coverage requirement this requirement means that the value of the investment companys total indebtedness may not exceed onethird of the value of its total assets including the indebtedness the funds borrowings will at all times be subject to the asset coverage requirement in addition to borrowing money the fund may also incur leveraged exposure via the use of derivatives    investment funds may also utilize leverage in their investment activities borrowings by investment funds are not subject to the asset coverage requirement accordingly the funds portfolio may be exposed to the risk of highly leveraged investment programs of certain investment funds and the volatility of the value of shares may be great especially during times of a credit crunch andor general market turmoil such as that experienced recently particularly during late  in general the use of leverage by investment funds or the fund may increase the volatility of the investment funds or the fund see types of investments and related risks  investment related

that the adviser will review the valuations provided by the investment managers to the investment funds however neither the adviser nor the board of trustees will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by the investment managers which are unaudited accordingly such valuations generally will be relied upon by the fund in addition the net asset values or other valuation

related risks  risks of fund of hedge funds structure  valuation unlisted closedend structure limited liquidity and transfer restrictions    the fund has been organized as a closedend management investment company closedend funds differ from openend management investment companies commonly known as mutual funds in that investors in a closedend fund do not have the right to redeem their shares on a daily basis to meet daily redemption requests mutual funds are subject to more stringent regulatory limitations than closedend funds    a shareholder will not be able to redeem his her or its

made at such times in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the board of trustees in its sole discretion in determining whether the fund should offer to repurchase shares the board of trustees will consider the recommendations of the adviser as to the timing of such an offer as well as a variety of         operational business and economic factors the adviser expects that generally it will recommend to the board of trustees that the fund offer to repurchase shares from shareholders quarterly with such repurchases to occur as of each march  june  september  and december  or if any such date is not a business day on the immediately preceding business day each repurchase offer will generally commence approximately  days prior to the applicable repurchase date the first offer to repurchase shares from shareholders is expected to occur on or about                  if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by shareholders who tender shares the fund will repurchase a pro rata portion of the shares tendered by each shareholder extend the repurchase offer or take any other action with respect to the repurchase offer permitted by applicable law the fund also has the right to

applicable for the fund in addition the fund has the right to repurchase shares of shareholders if the fund determines that the repurchase is in the best interest of the fund or upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the funds agreement and declaration of trust    the fund is subject to certain investment funds initial lockup periods beginning at the time of the funds initial investment in an investment fund during which the fund may not withdraw its investment in addition certain investment funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions such as those experienced by many hedge funds in late  during such periods the fund may not be able to liquidate its holdings in such investment funds in order to meet repurchase requests in addition should the fund seek to liquidate its investment in an investment fund that maintains a side pocket the fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay which could be considerable the fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in investment funds in a timely manner see repurchases and transfers of shares  no right of redemption and  repurchases of shares    a  early repurchase fee will be assessed to any shareholder that tenders his or her shares to the fund prior to the business day immediately preceding the oneyear anniversary of the shareholders purchase of the respective shares repurchase fee the repurchase fee would apply separately to each purchase of shares made by a shareholder for example if a shareholder purchases shares in january of year  and then purchases additional interests in december of year  such         shareholder would be subject to an early repurchase fee on the additional shares purchased in december of year  until december of year  the purpose of the repurchase fee is to reimburse the fund for the costs incurred in liquidating investments in the funds portfolio in order to honor the shareholders repurchase request and to discourage shortterm investments which are generally disruptive to the funds investment program summary of taxation    the fund expects to qualify and to continue to qualify as a ric under subchapter m of the code for each taxable year that the fund so qualifies the fund is not subject to federal income tax on that part of its taxable income that it distributes to shareholders taxable income consists generally of net investment income and any

and operation is vested in the individuals who serve on the board of trustees see management of the fund  board of trustees use of proceeds the proceeds from the sale of shares net of the funds

investment opportunities for a discussion of the timing of investment funds subscription activities market conditions and other considerations relevant to the timing of the funds investments generally the fund will pay the adviser the full amount of the management fee during any period prior to which any of the funds assets including any proceeds received by the fund from the offering of shares are invested in investment funds structure the fund is a specialized investment vehicle that combines many of the features of an investment fund not registered under the  act often referred to as a private investment fund with those of a registered closedend investment company private investment funds such as hedge funds are commingled asset pools that may engage in a wide variety of investment strategies including among others leverage short selling and derivative transactions investment funds typically offer their securities privately without registration under the  act in large minimum denominations often at least  million to a limited number of high net worth individual and institutional investors investment funds are excluded from the definition of investment company and hence are not registered as investment companies under the  act the managers or investment advisers of these funds are usually compensated through both assetbased fees and incentivebased feesallocations registered closedend investment companies are typically organized as corporations business trusts limited partnerships or limited liability companies that generally are managed more conservatively than most private investment funds due to certain requirements imposed by the  act and with respect to those registered closedend investment companies that qualify as rics under the code subchapter m of the code these registered companies often impose relatively modest minimum investment requirements such as  or less and publicly offer their shares to a broad range of investors in contrast to the higher minimum investment amounts and limited range of investors which as set forth above characterize the offerings of private investment funds securities the advisers to registered closedend investment companies are typically compensated through assetbased fees the fund is similar to a private investment fund in that it is actively managed and shares are sold in relatively large minimum denominations to high net worth individual and institutional investors in addition the investment managers are typically entitled to receive incentivebased compensation unlike many private investment funds however the fund as a registered closedend investment company can offer shares without limiting the number of eligible investors that can participate in its investment program the structure of the fund was designed to permit sophisticated investors that have a higher tolerance for investment risk to participate in an alternative investment program without making the more substantial minimum capital commitment that is required by many private investment funds and without subjecting the fund to the limitations on the number of eligible investors faced by many of those funds      investment program investment objective the fund seeks longterm capital growth by investing substantially all its assets in investment funds investment funds managed by a range of unaffiliated thirdparty investment managers investment managers specializing in alternative investment strategies the investment managers employ a variety of investment strategies including but not limited to hedging distressed securities eventdriven and relativevalue arbitrage and special situations alternative investment strategies allow investment managers the flexibility to use leveraged or shortsale positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across the global capital markets these strategies are in contrast to the investment programs of traditional registered investment companies such as mutual funds traditional investment companies are generally characterized by longonly investments and limits on the use of leverage because investment funds pursuing alternative investment strategies whether hedged or unhedged are often described as hedge funds the funds investment program can be broadly referred to as a fund of hedge funds in selecting investment funds the adviser does not follow a rigid asset allocation policy but instead invests in a wide variety of investment funds managed by investment managers specializing in different alternative investment strategies the fund is designed not only to utilize expert investment managers but also to deploy and redeploy investment capital within a range of investment strategies which the adviser regards as likely to provide favorable profit opportunities in changing economic environments investment philosophy the adviser applies a disciplined screening process in selecting investment funds which will include a review of a number of different factors which may incorporate among others one or more of the following criteria definable investment strategy and process  each investment manager must have a clearly defined investment strategy process and methodology the adviser verifies that the investment manager has in fact maintained discipline to its strategy in varying market conditions historical performance  the fund typically invests with investment managers who have historical risk adjusted performance records of significant duration such performance records should demonstrate an ability to achieve superior returns during both favorable and unfavorable market cycles disciplined risk management  investment managers are also evaluated on their ability to manage risk to an acceptably low level the adviser reviews overall market risk exposure hedging and other risk management techniques utilized by prospective investment managers to limit market exposure and downside risk commonality of financial interests  the fund typically selects investment managers who have meaningful financial commitments jointly with their clients demonstrated by having significant amounts of their personal capital invested in their own investment funds      the fund monitors investment managers and their investment funds on a regular basis the adviser generally contacts investment managers on at least a monthly basis in order to determine their performance and meets with the investment managers personally from time to time as appropriate performance and risk is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis with each investment manager and investment fund being compared to similar funds and the overall market the adviser also utilizes its investment acumen and extensive network of contacts in the industry to assist in evaluating certain events or trends whether within a market sector or strategy or as to a particular investment fund or investment manager traditional registered investment companies such as mutual funds generally are subject to significant regulatory restrictions in designing their own investment strategies relating to the use of leverage and the ability to sell securities short as a registered investment company the fund will be subject to such restrictions by contrast private unregistered investment funds such as the investment funds in which the fund invests are not subject to many of these limitations the adviser believes that the funds strategy of investing substantially all of its assets in these types of investment funds creates opportunities to participate in alternative methods of investing that may earn attractive riskadjusted returns the adviser intends to invest the assets of the fund in investment funds which employ alternative investment strategies there can be no assurance that these strategies will be attractive at any particular time the adviser believes that a portfolio of investment funds pursuing alternative investment strategies may produce capital growth more consistently and with less volatility than would most individual traditional or alternative investment strategies because alternative investment strategies may be risky the adviser believes it is prudent for the fund to generally invest in these strategies through investment funds organized as vehicles providing limited liability to their investors this structure limits the effect that losses incurred by any one investment fund will have on the assets of the fund by limiting the funds amount at risk to the amount invested in that investment fund in certain circumstances however the adviser believes that it may be appropriate to gain investment exposure to certain investment funds by entering into derivative transactions such as total return swaps options and forwards for example to achieve investment returns equivalent to those achieved by an investment manager in whose investment fund the fund could not invest directly perhaps because of its high investment minimum or its unavailability for direct investment the fund may enter into one or more swap agreements under which the fund may agree on a net basis to pay a return based on a floating interest rate and to receive the total return of the reference investment fund over a stated time period see types of investments and related risks special investment instruments and techniques  swap agreements the fund may incur leveraged exposure through its investments in derivatives which may in some circumstances involve significant risks of loss and may increase the volatility of the funds returns these risks may increase dramatically during times where general access to credit is severely impaired ie a credit crunch andor during general market turmoil such as that experienced during late  see types of investments and related risks  investment related risks  leverage utilized by the fund investment strategies the adviser intends to invest the assets of the fund in investment funds which employ diverse investment strategies and styles including but not limited to the following global longshort equity  longshort equity investment managers combine a portfolio of long equity positions with a portfolio of short equity positions long equity positions are expected to appreciate in value and short equity positions are expected to decrease in value an investment manager can look to add value on both the long and short positions or can simply use a short position to hedge      market exposure by shorting a security or index which has a high degree of correlation to the portfolios long positions investment managers may be anywhere from net long to net short depending on market conditions and generally increase net exposure when markets are expected to rise and decrease net exposure when markets are expected to fall strategies can be value or growth oriented and may invest in equities across the market capitalization spectrum and across multiple countries and regions investment managers may take long positions in securities believed to be undervalued and may take short positions in securities believed to be overvalued in the event that the perceived mispricings underlying one or more investment managers trading positions were to fail to converge toward or were to diverge further from relationships expected by such investment managers the fund may incur significant losses credit  special situations  credit strategies refer to any strategies that utilize credit related securities such as various fixed income instruments and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps common credit strategies include distressed investing and credit arbitrage distressed securities strategies invest in companies affected by an adverse financial or operating situation such as bankruptcies debt restructuring over levered balance sheets corporate reorganizations poor operating results and the distressed sale of assets an investment manager will invest in distressed securities believed to be selling at a price below the value of such securities after a reorganization or liquidation of the company at times the distressed investment manager may take an active role in creditor committees during the bankruptcy or reorganization process to work towards a favorable outcome for the securities being held depending on the investment managers style investments may be made in bank debt corporate debt trade claims common stock preferred stock andor warrants returns from distressed securities strategies are usually dependent on the outcome of the bankruptcy or reorganization process credit arbitrage strategies attempt to exploit pricing inefficiencies between similarly structured credit sensitive securities of different issuers for example although the bonds of two different companies may have comparable duration coupon rates and credit ratings one bond may trade at a premium to the other generally credit instruments used may include loans bonds and credit default swaps a variety of hedging techniques are employed to reduce certain risks including interest rate and credit risk an investment manager would look to exploit the pricing discrepancy by buying the undervalued security and shorting the overvalued security expecting to make a profit as the prices of the two securities begin to converge investment managers employing a special situations strategy generally utilize distressedtype analysis in order to analyze companies that are not in bankruptcy but are undergoing other event driven transactions such as restructurings turnarounds and spinoffs in addition the securities used in special situations strategies tend to be more liquid than those used by pure distressed securities investment managers event driven multistrategy  arbitrage  event driven investing is also referred to as corporate life cycle investing and focuses on opportunities created by transactional events such as spinoffs consolidations mergers and acquisitions liquidations recapitalization bankruptcies and other significant corporate transactions event driven strategies analyze these transactions in order to predict the outcome and commit capital in a way that benefits from that outcome event driven strategies are broad in scope and employ a diverse set of securities including common and preferred stock debt securities warrants stubs and derivatives more focused event driven type strategies include merger arbitrage distressed securities and special situations the success of the strategy primarily relies on the accurate assessment of the outcome and timing of the transactions and the proper deployment of capital multistrategy investment managers may engage in a variety of these investment strategies intermarket arbitrage  different markets may react differently to price changes in the same asset class for example the price of the common stock of a company that produces a commodity may change in a manner significantly divergent from but related to the price changes of the commodity these intermarket discrepancies create an opportunity for investors willing to exploit the market volatility and arbitrage the differences in valuations arbitrage strategies may also involve the use of options financial futures and other financial instruments or derivatives      convertible securities arbitrage  in convertible securities arbitrage offsetting positions are taken in convertible securities and the equity or debt security into which the convertible securities can be converted in an attempt to profit from price differentials between the two convertible securities include bonds preferred stocks options warrants and other securities that may be converted generally into common stock profit opportunities exist in such arbitrage strategies because the market periodically misprices certain convertible securities in relation to the underlying stock evaluating convertible securities involves a complex analysis of factors such as prevailing interest rates dividend payout levels the remaining length of the conversion period and the credit standing of the issuer merger or risk arbitrage  merger arbitrage involves acquiring securities of companies which are potentially subject to a merger acquisition exchange offer tender offer or reorganization with the expectation that profits will result from the spread between the price at which a position can be purchased  generally discounted primarily to reflect the possibility that the transaction may not occur  and the amount that will be realized when the transaction is consummated distressed securities arbitrage  distressed securities arbitrage involves acquiring the securities or obligations of financially troubled companies at a discount including those of companies involved in bankruptcy proceedings reorganizations or liquidation for the purpose of realizing a spread or gain upon the conclusion success or perceived success of the bankruptcy proceedings reorganizations or liquidations capital structure arbitrage  investment managers employing capital structure arbitrage strategy invest both long and short in the securities within a given companys capital structure investment managers implementing this strategy often establish long positions in senior or secured debt instruments that trade at a discount to intrinsic value or close to fair value and establish simultaneous short positions in subordinated debt or equity securities deemed to be overvalued relative to the senior debt fixed income arbitrage  investment managers employing a fixed income arbitrage strategy trade government bonds interest rate swaps repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements futures and related derivative securities to take advantage of mispricings that occur in various fixed income markets a fixed income arbitrage strategy generally requires a substantial amount of leverage in order to produce attractive rates of return yield curve arbitrage  investment managers who employ a yield curve arbitrage strategy take offsetting positions at various points of the yield curve typically those of a treasury bill in response to perceived disequilibrium price relationships this strategy also can involve looking for pricing imperfections between the futures and cash treasury markets investment managers who employ a yield curve arbitrage strategy often take positions in the futures and swaps markets as an alternative to directly buying or selling bonds mortgage arbitrage  a mortgage arbitrage investment strategy focuses on mortgagebacked securities mbs and their related derivatives investment managers typically take a long position on a mbs and short a government bond of similar maturity activist  activist investment managers focus on longterm undervalued strategic investments and work to proactively create a catalyst to unlock value activist investment managers attempt to unlock value in companies by developing relationships with management and seek to implement strategic changes that are expected to lead to higher share prices such as changes in corporate direction and management corporate restructuring recapitalization and share buybacks improvement of operations or a sale of the company profits are made when successful value enhancing activities lead to an increase in the price of the companys securities      traditional buy and hold  purchasing equity andor debt securities of us companies or worldwide for long term investment and capital appreciation based upon value growth technical andor fundamental criteria opportunistic trading  purchasing and selling securities including but not limited to common and preferred stocks debt securities and shortterm moneymarket instruments and options financial futures and other financial instruments or derivatives based largely on expectations of specific shortterm price movements and overall market trends this may also include increasing or decreasing the net exposure of a portfolio a basket of securities or a securities index based on judgments concerning the level and direction of a market sector or the market as a whole shortselling  a short sale involves the sale of a security that the investment fund does not own which security is borrowed in anticipation of being able subsequently to purchase the security at a lower price to cover the borrowed position short sales are made in securities that are identified as being overvalued frequently in companies with questionable accounting or management or serious threats to their viability as a going concern emerging markets  emerging market investments include equity and debt instruments of companies located in developing countries worldwide whose securities are traded on established securities markets either offshore or within the united states flexible longshort hedged strategies  hedged strategies maintain both long and short equity or debt positions in order to moderate risk exposure and simultaneously benefit from trends in an individual security a market sector or the market as a whole hedged strategies may also involve the use of options financial futures and other financial instruments or derivatives in implementing trading methodologies investment selection the adviser is responsible for the allocation of assets to various investment funds subject to policies adopted by the board of trustees the adviser employs a multimanager approach and invests in a wide variety of investment funds managed by investment managers specializing in different alternative investment strategies the adviser attempts to select individual investment managers that offer a variety of different skills in an effort to further balance the funds investment portfolio and to maximize opportunities for capital growth the adviser considers a number of factors in selecting investment managers including the investment managers basic investment strategy and policies reputation prior performance use of fundamental analysis and other analytical methods use of leverage and other techniques and trading acumen on an ongoing basis the adviser conducts similar periodic reviews with respect to investment funds in which the fund has invested to narrow the set of investment funds and investment strategies initially identified for consideration the adviser conducts ongoing analysis of investment managers and investment strategies the adviser expects that only a few investment funds will be deemed sufficiently interesting to warrant further review after the initial analysis following this analysis the adviser conducts extensive due diligence on the investment funds that it considers likely to generate superior riskadjusted returns consistent with the advisers views at that time as to both the most attractive strategy types and the needs of the funds existing portfolio the due diligence process typically includes meetings with the investment manager to seek to understand the investment managers investment strategy investment philosophy and portfolio construction procedures the due diligence process seeks to identify the types of securities and other instruments held or techniques utilized and to confirm the presence of and adherence to an investment and risk control process the due diligence process also typically includes quantitative analysis of the investment strategy including an analysis of past performance history and risk factors      if the advisers assessment of the abilities of the investment manager and the attractiveness of the investment strategy employed by the investment manager are sufficiently positive then further due diligence typically will be performed the additional diligence generally involves an analysis of the operational and legal structure of the investment fund and background investigations of the investment manager the investment managers fee structure the depth and quality of the investment managers organization the legal terms and conditions of the investment funds governing documents the potential for developing and maintaining a longterm relationship with the investment manager and the likely alignment of interests between the investment fund its investment manager and the fund are examples of factors that the adviser typically investigates the advisers personnel have extensive experience and expertise with alternative investment strategies and investment managers and have evaluated numerous investment funds representing many categories of alternative investments and utilizing various investment strategies for a more complete description of the experience of the personnel of the adviser who are principally responsible for the management of the fund see the adviser portfolio construction the adviser allocates fund assets among the investment funds that in its view represent attractive investment opportunities consistent with the objectives of the fund allocation depends on the advisers assessment of the likely risks and returns of various investment strategies that the investment funds utilize and the likely correlation among the investment funds under consideration the adviser generally seeks to invest substantially all of the funds assets in investment funds whose expected riskadjusted returns are deemed attractive the adviser periodically reallocates the funds investments among investment funds in order to increase the funds expected riskadjusted return there is no guarantee that the fund will be able to avoid substantial losses due to poor returns by an investment fund while the fund is a nondiversified fund under the  act the adviser believes it is important to maintain a broadbased portfolio in order to reduce the effect on the fund of losses or poor returns by any one investment fund there is no guarantee however that the fund will be able to avoid substantial losses due to poor returns by an investment fund in addition while the fund is a nondiversified fund for purposes of the  act the fund has elected and intends to qualify to be treated as a ric under the code to qualify as a ric under the code the fund must among other things i derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined in the code and ii diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of each taxable year a at least  of the market value of the funds assets is represented by cash cash items us government securities securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities with such other securities of any one issuer limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than  of the value of the funds total assets and  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and b not more than  of the market value of the funds total assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities and the securities of other regulated investment companies of  any one issuer  any two or more issuers that the fund controls and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses or  any one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships in addition the adviser typically endeavors to limit investments in any one investment fund to no more than  of the funds gross assets measured at the time of purchase and to limit      investments in any one investment manager to no more than  of the funds gross assets measured at the time of purchase the adviser limits fund investments in any one investment fund to less than  of such investment funds outstanding voting securities see types of investments and related risks  risks of fund of hedge funds structure  investments in nonvoting stock inability to vote investment funds in which the fund invests are not subject to the funds investment restrictions and are generally not subject to any investment limitations under the  act or the code therefore the fund is not entitled to the protections of the  act with respect to the investment funds for example the investment funds are not required to and may not hold custody of their assets in accordance with the requirements of the  act as a result bankruptcy or fraud at institutions such as brokerage firms banks or administrators into whose custody those investment funds have placed their assets could impair the operational capabilities or the capital position of the investment funds and may in turn have an adverse impact on the fund see other riskslegal and regulatory risks in response to adverse market economic or political conditions the fund may invest temporarily in high quality fixed income securities money market instruments and money market funds or may hold cash or cash equivalents for temporary defensive purposes in addition the fund may also make these types of investments pending the investment of assets in investment funds or to maintain the liquidity necessary to effect repurchases of shares and pay fund expenses leverage the fund may borrow money in connection with its investment activities  ie the fund may utilize leverage specifically the fund may borrow money through a credit facility or other arrangements in limited circumstances to manage timing issues in connection with the acquisition of its investments ie to provide the fund with temporary liquidity to acquire investments in investment funds in advance of the funds receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more investment funds or the receipt of proceeds from the sale of additional shares the fund also may borrow money to fund repurchase payments to shareholders pending the receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more investment funds the  act requires a registered investment company to satisfy an asset coverage requirement of  of its indebtedness including amounts borrowed measured at the time the investment company incurs the indebtedness this requirement means that the value of the investment companys total indebtedness may not exceed one third the value of its total assets including the indebtedness the funds borrowings will at all times be subject to the asset coverage requirement in addition to borrowing money the fund may also incur leveraged exposure via the use of derivatives investment funds may also utilize leverage in their investment activities borrowings by investment funds are not subject to the asset coverage requirement accordingly the funds portfolio may be exposed to the risk of highly leveraged investment programs of certain investment funds and the volatility of the value of shares may be great especially during times of a credit crunch andor general market turmoil such as that experienced during late  in general the use of leverage by investment funds or the fund may increase the volatility of the

registered investment companies as to the types of securities the unregistered funds hold the types of trading strategies used and in some cases the extent to which leverage is used the investment managers selected by the fund have full discretion without the funds input to purchase and sell securities and other investments for their respective investment funds consistent with the relevant investment advisory agreements or governing documents of the investment funds the investment funds are generally not limited in the markets in which they invest either by location or type such as us or nonus large capitalization or small capitalization or the investment discipline that they may employ such as value or growth strategies or bottomup or topdown analysis these investment funds may invest and trade in a wide range of securities and other financial instruments and will pursue a wide variety of investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and nonhedging purposes in selecting investment funds the adviser does not follow a rigid asset allocation policy but instead invests in a wide variety of investment managers trading a range of strategies including but not limited to hedging distressed securities arbitrage and special situations the fund is designed not only to utilize expert investment managers but also to deploy and redeploy investment capital within a range of investment strategies which the adviser regards as likely to provide favorable profit opportunities in changing economic environments see investment programinvestment strategies although the investment funds will primarily invest and trade in equity and debt securities they may also invest and trade in equityrelated instruments currencies financial futures debtrelated instruments and any other instruments that are deemed appropriate by the relevant investment manager and permitted under the relevant investment funds governing documents the investment funds may also sell securities short purchase and sell option and futures contracts and engage in other derivative transactions subject to certain limitations described elsewhere in this prospectus the use of one or more of these techniques may be an integral part of the investment program of an investment fund and involves certain risks the investment funds may use leverage which also entails risk see types of investments and related risks  investment related risks  leverage utilized by investment funds the adviser monitors the risks of individual investment funds and of the portfolio in the aggregate the primary goal of this process with respect to individual investment funds is to determine the degree to which the investment funds are performing as expected and to gain early insight into factors that might call for an increase or decrease in the allocation of the funds assets among those investment funds with respect to aggregate portfolio monitoring the adviser endeavors to monitor to the best of its ability the funds aggregate exposures to various risks the adviser may also use futures options swaps or other instruments in order to balance the overall mix andor manage risk in the funds portfolio subject to certain limitations contained in the  act such derivatives may be based on various underlying instruments including investment funds individual securities securities indices or interest rates such derivatives entail certain risks the adviser may also invest in underlying investment funds that pursue tail risk hedging strategies a tail risk hedging strategy is one that outperforms during periods of market stress and is designed to provide a hedge against rare events that can significantly and negatively affect the global markets see types of investments and related risks  special investment instruments and techniques the adviser monitors the operation and performance of an investment fund as frequently as the adviser believes is appropriate in light of the strategy followed by the investment manager and prevailing market conditions the adviser solicits such information from the investment manager and other sources such as prime brokers that the adviser deems necessary to properly assess the relative success or failure of an investment fund prime brokers typically are large fullservice brokerages that provide clients with researchrelated goods and services and support infrastructure to engage in various trading strategies the adviser conducts reviews with investment managers and the advisers network and analyzes a variety of data changes in leverage personnel market behavior expenses litigation capital resources economic conditions and other factors may be monitored as appropriate and to the extent the information is available to the adviser      based on the advisers assessment of factors such as i the degree to which the investment manager is pursuing an investment strategy consistent with its stated policy ii whether and to what degree the focus incentives and investment strategy of the investment manager have changed and iii whether the investment strategy employed remains consistent with the objectives of the fund the adviser may periodically adjust the funds allocations among investment funds the funds investment program entails substantial risks there can be no assurances that the investment objectives of the fund including its risk monitoring goals will be achieved and results may vary substantially over time the fund may consider it appropriate subject to applicable laws and regulations to utilize forward and futures contracts options swaps other derivative instruments short sales margin or leverage in the funds investment program such investment techniques can substantially increase the adverse impact to which the funds investment portfolio may be subject see types of investments and related risks  special investment instruments and techniques types of investments and related risks general the value of the funds total net assets may be expected to fluctuate in response to fluctuations in the value of the investment funds in which the fund invests discussed below are the investments generally made by investment funds and the principal risks that the adviser and the fund believe are associated with those investments these risks will in turn have an effect on the fund the fund invests substantially all its assets in investment funds the funds direct investments generally are limited to derivative investments to gain exposure to certain investment funds such as total return swaps options or futures additionally in response to adverse market economic or political conditions the fund may invest temporarily in high quality fixed income securities money market instruments and unaffiliated money market funds or may hold cash or cash equivalents for temporary defensive purposes in addition the fund may also make these types of investments pending the investment of assets in investment funds or to maintain the liquidity necessary to effect repurchases of shares and pay fund expenses when the fund takes a defensive position or otherwise makes these types of investments it may not achieve its investment objective investment related risks market risks the success of any investment activity is affected by general economic conditions which may affect the level and volatility of interest rates and the extent and timing of investor participation in the markets for both equities and interestsensitive securities unexpected volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which the fund directly or indirectly holds positions could impair the funds ability to carry on its business or cause it to incur losses the profitability of a significant portion of the funds investment program may depend to a great extent upon correctly assessing the future course of price movements of stocks and bonds there can be no assurance that the investment managers will be able to predict those price movements accurately volatility of financial markets risks of certain investment strategies recently the financial markets have evidenced an exceptional level of volatility while the trading strategy of certain investment managers seeks to exploit such volatility continued volatility could disrupt the investment strategy of such investment manager decrease the value of the funds portfolio and adversely impact its profitability if an investment managers evaluation of an investment opportunity should prove incorrect the fund could experience losses as a result of a decline in the market value of securities in      which an investment fund holds a long position or an increase in the value of securities in which an investment fund holds a short position the risk management techniques that may be utilized by the investment managers will not provide any assurance that the fund will not be exposed to a risk of significant investment losses the investment managers investment programs may utilize such investment techniques as margin transactions short sales leverage and options on securities forwards and futures subject to applicable regulatory requirements which practices can in certain circumstances increase the adverse impact to which the fund may be subject the timing of such adverse impacts cannot be predicted and may result in substantial volatility in the performance of the fund investment funds are subject to the risk that trading activity in securities in which the investment funds invest may be dramatically reduced or cease at any time whether due to general market turmoil problems experienced by a single issuer or a market sector or other factors if trading in particular securities or classes of securities is impaired it may be difficult for an investment fund to properly value any of its assets represented by such securities in particular since late  the trading market for certain classes of securities such as collateralized debt obligations backed by mortgages especially subprime mortgages assetbacked commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles and auction rate preferred shares has been dramatically impaired resulting in greater difficulties valuing such securities for which a robust market previously had existed for additional valuation risks to which investment funds may be subject see types of investments and related risks  risks of fund of hedge funds structure  valuation the deterioration of the credit markets since late  generally has caused an adverse impact in a broad range of markets including us and international credit and interbank money markets generally thereby affecting a wide range of financial institutions and markets in particular events in the financial sector during late  have resulted and may continue to result in an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets both domestic and foreign more recently continued weakness in the us housing market questions about the strength and sustainability of the us economic recovery concerns about the growing federal debt and the european sovereign debt and banking crisis are factors which continue to concern the financial markets and create volatility the fund may invest in investment funds that have exposure to the securities of financial services companies numerous financial services companies have experienced substantial declines in the valuations of their assets taken action to raise capital such as the issuance of debt or equity securities or even ceased operations these actions have caused the securities of many financial services companies to experience a dramatic decline in value certain financial companies have avoided collapse due to intervention by the us regulatory authorities but such interventions have often not averted a substantial decline in the value of such companies common stock issuers that have exposure to the real estate mortgage and credit markets have been particularly affected by the foregoing events and the general market turmoil and it is uncertain whether or for how long these conditions will continue moreover legal or regulatory changes applicable to financial services companies may adversely affect such companies ability to return to previous levels of profitability see other risks  legal and regulatory risks in addition the recent market turmoil and weakened position of many financial services companies have forced many such companies to reduce or terminate the credit they have extended to hedge funds which has in turn forced many hedge funds to deleverage by selling large portions of their investments in a fairly short period of time if an investment fund is required to deleverage in such fashion its returns will likely be substantially reduced and it may be forced to liquidate entirely if it cannot cover its outstanding indebtedness see types of investment and related risks  investment related risks  leverage utilized by the fund and types of investment and related risks  investment related risks  leverage utilized by investment funds      general risks of securities activities all securities investing and trading activities risk the loss of capital although the adviser will attempt to moderate these risks no assurance can be given that the funds investment activities will be successful or that shareholders will not suffer losses to the extent that the portfolio of an investment fund is concentrated in securities of a single issuer or issuers in a single industry the risk of any investment decision made by the investment manager of such investment fund is increased following below are some of the more significant specific risks that the adviser and the fund believe are associated with the investment funds styles of investing equity securities investment funds may hold long and short positions in common stocks preferred stocks and convertible securities of us and nonus issuers investment funds also may invest in depositary receipts or shares relating to nonus securities see nonus securities equity securities fluctuate in value often based on factors unrelated to the fundamental economic condition of the issuer of the securities including general economic and market conditions and these fluctuations can be pronounced investment funds may purchase securities in all available securities trading markets and may invest in equity securities without restriction as to market capitalization such as those issued by smaller capitalization companies including micro cap companies see smaller capitalization issuers growth investing certain investment funds invest in growth stocks securities of growth companies may be more volatile since such companies usually invest a high portion of earnings in their business and they may lack the dividends of value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market in addition earnings disappointments often lead to sharply falling prices because investors buy growth stocks in anticipation of superior earnings growth value investing certain investment funds invest in value stocks an investment manager to an investment fund may be wrong in its assessment of a companys value and the stocks the investment fund holds may not reach what the investment manager believes are their full values a particular risk of an investment funds value approach is that some holdings may not recover and provide the capital growth anticipated or a stock judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced further because the prices of valueoriented securities tend to correlate more closely with economic cycles than growthoriented securities they generally are more sensitive to changing economic conditions such as changes in interest rates corporate earnings and industrial production the market may not favor valueoriented stocks and may not favor equities at all during those periods the investment funds relative performance may suffer event driven investing event driven strategies analyze various transactions in order to predict a likely outcome and commit capital in a way that benefits from that outcome event driven strategies are broad in scope and employ a diverse set of securities including common and preferred stock debt securities warrants stubs and derivatives appreciation in the value of such securities may be contingent upon the occurrence of certain events such as a successful reorganization or merger if the expected event does not occur the investment fund may incur a loss on the investments there can be no assurance that any expected transaction will take place certain transactions are dependent on one or more factors to become effective such as market conditions which may lead to unexpected positive or negative changes in a company profile shareholder approval regulatory and various other third party constraints changes in earnings or business lines or shareholder activism as well as many other factors no assurance can be given that the transactions entered into will result in a profitable investment for the investment funds or that the investment funds will not incur substantial losses bonds and other fixed income securities investment funds may invest in bonds and other fixed income securities both us and nonus and may take short positions in these securities investment funds will invest in these securities when they offer opportunities for capital appreciation or capital depreciation in the case of short positions and may also invest in these securities for temporary defensive purposes and to maintain liquidity fixed income securities include among other securities bonds notes      and debentures issued by us and nonus corporations debt securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities us government securities or by a nonus government municipal securities and mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities these securities may pay fixed variable or floating rates of interest and may include zero coupon obligations fixed income securities are subject to the risk of the issuers inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations ie credit risk and are subject to price volatility resulting from among other things interest rate sensitivity market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity ie market risk distressed securities the investment funds in which the fund may invest may purchase equity and debt securities and other obligations of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business distress including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings these issuers may be in weak financial condition experiencing poor operating results having substantial capital needs or a negative net worth or facing special competitive or product obsolescence problems investments of this type may involve substantial financial and business risks that can result in substantial or at times even total losses under such circumstances the returns generated from the funds investments may not compensate the shareholders adequately for the risks assumed acquired investments may include senior or subordinated debt securities bank loans promissory notes and other evidences of indebtedness as well as payables to trade creditors although such purchases may result in significant returns to the fund they involve a substantial degree of risk and may not show any return for a considerable period of time in fact many of these securities and investments ordinarily remain unpaid while the company is in bankruptcy and may not ultimately be paid unless and until the company reorganizes andor emerges from bankruptcy proceedings as a result such securities may have to be held for an extended period of time in the event that investment funds acquire loans and other assets that are distressed or nonperforming it may be necessary for the investment manager to restructure the obligation or foreclose on a mortgage or security interest and sell the collateral in order to realize value there are a variety of risks associated with such strategy including i an inability to successfully restructure the loan or other obligation ii even if restructured the obligors financial condition may continue to worsen leading to a new default on the restructured obligation iii litigation risks and iv bankruptcy risks including unpredictability delays and costs associated with a bankruptcy the level of analytical sophistication both financial and legal necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial distress is high there is no assurance that the investment managers will correctly evaluate the nature and magnitude of the various factors that could affect the prospects for a successful reorganization or similar action among the risks inherent in investments in troubled entities is the fact that it frequently may be difficult to obtain information as to the true condition of such issuers such investments also may be adversely affected by laws relating to among other things fraudulent transfers and other voidable transfers or payments lender liability and the bankruptcy courts power to disallow reduce subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims if in a lawsuit brought by an unpaid creditor or representative of creditors of an issuer of indebtedness a court were to find that the issuer did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring the indebtedness and that after giving effect to such indebtedness the issuer i was insolvent ii was engaged in a business for which the remaining assets of such issuer constituted unreasonably small capital or iii intended to incur or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature such court could determine to invalidate in whole or in part such indebtedness as a fraudulent conveyance to subordinate such indebtedness to existing or future creditors of such issuer or to recover amounts previously paid by such issuer in satisfaction of such      indebtedness the measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing will vary generally an issuer would be considered insolvent at a particular time if the sum of its debts was then greater than all of its property at fair valuation or if the present fair saleable value of its assets was then less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they became absolute and matured there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether the issuer was insolvent after giving effect to the incurrence of the indebtedness in which an investment fund invested or that regardless of the method of valuation a court would not determine that the issuer was insolvent upon giving effect to such incurrence in addition in the event of the insolvency of an issuer of indebtedness in which an investment fund invests payments made on such indebtedness could be subject to avoidance as a preference if made within a certain period of time which may be as long as one year before insolvency in general if payments on indebtedness are avoidable whether as fraudulent conveyances or preferences such payments can be recaptured from the investment fund to which such payments were made the fund does not anticipate that investment funds will engage in conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon fraudulent conveyance preference or equitable subordination there can be no assurance however as to whether any lending institution or other party from which the investment fund may acquire such indebtedness engaged in any such conduct or any other conduct that would subject such indebtedness and the investment fund to insolvency laws and if it did as to whether such creditor claims could be asserted in a us court or in the courts of any other country against the investment fund the administrative costs incurred in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding are frequently high and will be paid out of the debtors estate prior to any return to creditors other than out of assets or proceeds thereof which are subject to valid and enforceable liens and other security interests and equity holders in addition certain claims that have priority by law over the claims of certain creditors for example claims for taxes may be quite high the market prices of such securities are also subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and aboveaverage price volatility and the spread between the bid and asked prices of such securities may be greater than those prevailing in other securities markets it may be necessary for some of the assets acquired by the investment funds to be held for a significant period of time in order to realize a profit the investment thesis for acquiring such assets is that they are trading at distressed levels that do not accurately reflect the risk or intrinsic value of the asset and that they will recover a significant portion of their value as conditions in the credit markets normalize there can be no assurances that this will be the case or how long it will take for conditions in the credit markets to materially improve in fact conditions may continue to worsen before they improve securities issued by distressed companies may have a limited trading market resulting in limited liquidity as a result investment managers may have difficulties in valuing or liquidating positions high yield securities investment funds may invest in fixed income securities rated investment grade or noninvestment grade commonly referred to as junk bonds and may invest in unrated fixed income securities noninvestment grade debt securities in the lowest rating categories or unrated debt securities determined to be of comparable quality may involve a substantial risk of default or may be in default adverse changes in economic conditions or developments regarding the individual issuer are more likely to cause price volatility and weaken the capacity of the issuers of noninvestment grade debt securities to make principal and interest payments than issuers of higher grade debt securities an economic downturn affecting an issuer of noninvestment grade debt securities may result in an increased incidence of default in addition the market for lower grade debt securities may be thinner and less active than for higher grade debt securities      convertible securities convertible securities are bonds debentures notes or other securities that may be converted or exchanged by the holder or by the issuer into shares of the underlying common stock or cash or securities of equivalent value at a stated exchange ratio convertible securities until converted have the same general characteristics as debt securities insofar as they generally provide a stable stream of income with generally higher yields than those of equity securities of the same or similar issuers by permitting the holder to exchange an investment for common stock or the cash value of a security or a basket or index of securities convertible securities may also enable the investor to benefit from increases in the market price of the underlying securities therefore convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality convertible securities may be subordinate to other securities in part the total return for a convertible security depends upon performance of the underlying stock into which it can be converted also issuers of convertible securities are often not as strong financially as those issuing securities with higher credit ratings are more likely to encounter financial difficulties and typically are more vulnerable to changes in the economy such as a recession or a sustained period of rising interest rates which could affect their ability to make interest and principal payments if an issuer stops making interest andor principal payments the investment funds could lose their entire investment the values of a synthetic convertible and a true convertible security may respond differently to market fluctuations in addition in purchasing a synthetic convertible security investment funds may have counterparty including counterparty credit risk with respect to the financial institution or investment bank that offers the instrument purchasing a synthetic convertible security may provide greater flexibility than purchasing a traditional convertible security preferred securities preferred stock represents an equity or ownership interest in an issuer preferred stock normally pays dividends at a specified rate and has precedence over common stock in the event the issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy however in the event an issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy the claims of owners of bonds take precedence over the claims of those who own preferred and common stock preferred stock unlike common stock often has a stated dividend rate payable from the corporations earnings preferred stock dividends may be cumulative or noncumulative participating or auction rate cumulative dividend provisions require all or a portion of prior unpaid dividends to be paid before dividends can be paid to the issuers common stock participating preferred stock may be entitled to a dividend exceeding the stated dividend in certain cases if interest rates rise the fixed dividend on preferred stocks may be less attractive causing the price of such stocks to decline preferred stock may have mandatory sinking fund provisions as well as provisions allowing the stock to be called or redeemed which can limit the benefit of a decline in interest rates preferred stock is subject to many of the risks to which common stock and debt securities are subject short sales short selling involves selling securities which may or may not be owned and borrowing the same securities for delivery to the purchaser with an obligation to replace the borrowed securities at a later date short selling allows the investor to profit from declines in market prices to the extent such decline exceeds the transaction costs and the costs of borrowing the securities however since the borrowed securities must be replaced by purchases at market prices in order to close out the short position any appreciation in the price of the borrowed securities would result in a loss purchasing securities to close out the short position can itself cause the price of the securities to rise further thereby exacerbating the loss an investment fund may make short sales againstthebox in which it will sell short securities it owns or has the right to obtain without payment of additional consideration if an investment fund makes a short sale againstthebox it will be required to set aside securities equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short or securities convertible or exchangeable into those securities and will be required to hold those securities while the short sale is outstanding an investment fund will incur transaction costs including interest expenses in connection with initiating maintaining and closingout short sales againstthebox      on september   in response to spreading turmoil in the financial markets the securities and exchange commission the sec temporarily banned short selling in the stocks of numerous financial services companies and also promulgated new disclosure requirements with respect to short positions held by investment managers various international regulatory bodies including the united kingdoms financial services authority also promulgated restrictions on short selling at that time the secs temporary ban on short selling of such stocks has since expired but similar restrictions andor additional disclosure requirements may be promulgated at any time especially if market turmoil persists restrictions on the short sale of the securities of financial services companies based in a particular country continue to be imposed by regulators in a variety of european jurisdictions if investment funds are subjected to such new restrictions they may be forced to cover short positions more quickly than otherwise intended and may suffer losses as a result such restrictions may also adversely affect the ability of investment funds to execute their investment strategies generally especially if short selling is a fundamental element of their strategies the sec has subsequently adopted amendments to regulation sho under the securities exchange act of  that restrict the ability to engage in a short sale at a price that is less than or equal to the current best bid if the price of the covered security has decreased by  or more from the covered securitys closing price as of the end of the prior day a short salerelated circuit breaker see types of investments and related risks  other risks  legal and regulatory risks mortgagebacked securities investment funds may invest in mortgagebacked securities the investment characteristics of mortgagebacked securities differ from those of traditional debt securities among the major differences are that interest and principal payments on mortgagebacked securities are made more frequently usually monthly and that principal may be prepaid at any time because the underlying loans or other assets generally may be prepaid at any time the adverse effects of prepayments may indirectly affect the fund in two ways first particular investments may experience outright losses as in the case of an interestonly security in an environment of faster than expected actual or anticipated prepayments second particular investments may underperform relative to hedges that the investment funds may have entered into for these investments resulting in a loss to the investment fund in particular prepayments at par may limit the potential upside of many mortgagebacked securities to their principal or par amounts whereas their corresponding hedges often have the potential for large losses the investment funds may also invest in structured notes variable rate mortgagebacked securities including adjustablerate mortgage securities arms which are backed by mortgages with variable rates and certain classes of collateralized mortgage obligation cmo derivatives the rate of interest payable under which varies with a designated rate or index the value of these investments is closely tied to the absolute levels of such rates or indices or the markets perception of anticipated changes in those rates or indices this introduces additional risk factors related to the movements in specific indices or interest rates that may be difficult or impossible to hedge and which also interact in a complex fashion with prepayment risks mortgagebacked securities are also subject to the risk of delinquencies on mortgage loans underlying such securities an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of a mortgagebacked security and could result in losses to an investment fund socalled subprime mortgages mortgage loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with a lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages have experienced higher rates of delinquency and such delinquencies have increased dramatically since  these increased mortgage delinquencies have adversely impacted the market for mortgagebacked securities generally including derivatives or other instruments linked to the value of such securities and led to      turmoil in the credit markets generally in particular holders of mortgagebacked securities have experienced great difficulty in valuing such securities in light of the dramatically reduced market for mortgagebacked securities see types of investments and related risks  risks of fund of hedge funds structure  valuation commodities commodities are assets that have tangible properties major categories include agricultural products eg wheat cattle energy products eg oil gasoline metals eg gold aluminum and soft products eg sugar coffee cocoa cotton commodities can be traded on a spot basis ie price for immediate delivery or on a futures basis ie price for delivery at a specified future date most commodity investments involve buying or selling futures rather than transacting in the spot market a rise in price of a particular commodity will generally cause the price of the futures to rise benefiting a futures buyer similarly a decline in price will benefit a futures seller the fund may seek to invest with investment managers who engage in commodity futures trading in addition investment funds may seek to invest directly in commodities through strategies that purchase or sell commodity futures as permitted by applicable law commodity and financial markets are highly volatile because of the low margin deposits normally required in futures trading and because a high degree of leverage is typical of a futures trading account as a result a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in substantial losses to the investor in addition commodity exchanges may limit fluctuations in commodity futures contract prices during a single day and thus during a single trading day no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit once the price of a futures contract for a particular commodity has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in the commodity can be neither taken nor liquidated unless the investment funds are willing to effect trades at or within the limit which may hinder the ability of the investment funds to trade energynatural resources investing the production and marketing of commodities energy and natural resources may be affected by actions and changes in governments securities of such companies may be subject to broad price fluctuations reflecting volatility of energy and basic materials prices and possible instability of supply of various hard assets as well as changes in demand due to international economic conditions in addition some such companies also may be subject to the risks of mining and oil drilling and the risks of other hazards such as fire drought and increased regulatory and environmental costs real estate investing in real estate including real estate investment trusts reits may subject an investment fund to risks associated with the ownership of real estate including terrorist attacks war or other acts that destroy real property in addition to securities market risks some reits may invest in a limited number of properties in a narrow geographic area or in a single property type which increases the risk that an investment fund could be unfavorably affected by the poor performance of a single investment or investment type these companies are also sensitive to factors such as changes in real estate values and property taxes interest rates cash flow of underlying real estate assets supply and demand and the management skill and creditworthiness of the issuer borrowers could default on or sell investments the reit holds which could reduce the cash flow needed to make distributions to investors in addition reits also may be affected by tax and regulatory requirements in that a reit may not qualify for preferential tax treatments or exemptions reits require specialized management and pay management expenses securities issued by private partnerships in real estate may be more illiquid than securities issued by other investment funds generally because the partnerships underlying real estate investments may tend to be less liquid than other types of investments nonus securities an investment fund may invest in nonus securities denominated in nonus currencies andor traded outside of the united states such investments require consideration of certain risks typically not associated with investing in us securities or property such risks include      among other things trade balances and imbalances and related economic policies unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations impositions of exchange control regulation by the united states or foreign governments united states and foreign withholding taxes limitations on the removal of funds or other assets policies of governments with respect to possible nationalization of their industries political difficulties including expropriation of assets confiscatory taxation and economic or political instability in foreign nations there may be less publicly available information about certain foreign companies than there would be in the case of comparable companies in the united states certain foreign companies may not be subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements comparable to or as uniform as those of united states companies securities markets outside the united states while growing in volume have for the most part substantially less volume than us markets and many securities traded on these foreign markets are less liquid and their prices are more volatile than securities of comparable united states companies in addition settlement of trades in some nonus markets is much slower and more susceptible to failure than in us markets the risks associated with investing in nonus securities may be greater with respect to those issued by companies located in emerging industrialized or less developed countries risks particularly relevant to emerging markets may include higher dependence on exports and the corresponding importance of international trade greater risk of inflation greater controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital increased likelihood of governmental involvement in and control over the economies governmental decisions to cease support of economic reform programs or to impose centrally planned economies and less developed corporate laws regarding fiduciary duties of officers and directors and protection of investors other risks of investing in nonus securities include the following nonus exchanges an investment fund may trade directly or indirectly futures and securities on exchanges located outside of the united states some nonus exchanges in contrast to us exchanges are principals markets in which performance is solely the individual members responsibility with whom the investment fund has entered into a commodity contract and not that of an exchange or clearinghouse if any in the case of trading on nonus exchanges an investment fund will be subject to the risk of the inability of or refusal by the counterparty to perform with respect to contracts moreover since there is generally less government supervision and regulation of nonus exchanges clearinghouses and clearing firms than in the united states an investment fund is also subject to the risk of the failure of the exchanges on which its positions trade or of their clearinghouses or clearing firms and there may be a high risk of financial irregularities andor lack of appropriate risk monitoring and controls nonus government securities an investment funds nonus investments may include debt securities issued or guaranteed by nonus governments their agencies or instrumentalities and supranational entities an investment fund may invest in debt securities issued by certain supranational entities which include entities designated or supported by governments to promote economic reconstruction or development international banking organizations and related government agencies an example of a supranational entity is the international bank for reconstruction and development commonly referred to as the world bank investment in sovereign debt of nonus governments can involve a high degree of risk including additional risks not present in debt obligations of corporate issues and the us government the issuer of the debt or the government authority that controls the repayment of sovereign debt may be unable or unwilling to repay the principal andor interest when due in accordance with the terms of the debt and an investment fund may have limited recourse to compel payment in the event of a default a      sovereign debtors or governmental entitys willingness or ability to repay principal andor interest due in a timely manner may be affected by among other factors its cash flow situation the extent of its foreign currency reserves the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole the sovereign debtors or governmental entitys policy toward international lenders such as the international monetary fund the political constraints to which a governmental entity may be subject and changes in governments and political systems at certain times certain countries particularly emerging market countries have declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on external debt governmental entities may also depend on expected disbursements from nonus governments multilateral agencies and others to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt the commitment on the part of these governments agencies and others to make such disbursements may be conditioned on a governmental entitys implementation of economic reforms andor economic performance and the timely service of such debtors obligations failure to implement such reforms achieve such levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of such third parties commitments to lend funds to the governmental entity which may further impair such debtors ability or willingness to service its debts in a timely manner consequently governmental entities may default on their sovereign debt holders of sovereign debt including the investment funds may be requested to participate in the rescheduling of such debt and to extend further loans to governmental entities there is no bankruptcy proceeding by which sovereign debt on which governmental entities have defaulted may be collected in whole or in part periods of economic uncertainty may result in the volatility of market prices of sovereign debt to a greater extent than the volatility inherent in debt obligations of other types of issues currencies one or more investment funds may invest a portion of its assets in nonus currencies or in instruments denominated in nonus currencies the prices of which are determined with reference to currencies other than the us dollar to the extent unhedged the value of such investment funds assets will fluctuate with us dollar exchange rates as well as the price changes of its investments in the various local markets and currencies thus an increase in the value of the us dollar compared to the other currencies in which the investment fund makes its investments will reduce the effect of increases and magnify the effect of decreases in the prices of securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and held by the investment fund in such securities respective local markets conversely a decrease in the value of the us dollar will have the opposite effect on the nonus dollar securities of the fund or such investment fund in addition some governments from time to time impose restrictions intended to prevent capital flight which may for example involve punitive taxation including high withholding taxes on certain securities transfers or the imposition of exchange controls making it difficult or impossible to exchange or repatriate the local currency an investment fund may also incur costs in connection with conversion between various currencies in addition certain investment funds may be denominated in non us currencies subscription amounts contributed by the fund for investment in such an investment fund will be converted immediately by the relevant investment manager from us dollars into the applicable foreign currency at the then applicable exchange rate determined by and available to the investment manager in certain cases depending on the applicable circumstances the exchange rate obtained by the investment manager may be less advantageous to the fund than other rates available to the fund directly an investment fund may utilize currency forward contracts and options to hedge against currency fluctuations forward contracts and options thereon unlike futures contracts are not traded on exchanges and are not standardized rather banks and dealers act as principals in these markets negotiating each transaction on a individual basis forward and cash trading is substantially unregulated there is no limitation on daily price movements and speculative position limits are not applicable the principals that deal in the forward markets are not required to continue to make markets in the currencies or commodities they trade and these markets can experience periods of illiquidity sometimes of significant duration there have been periods during which certain participants in these      markets have refused to quote prices for certain currencies or commodities or have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the price at which they were prepared to buy and that at which they were prepared to sell in respect of such trading an investment fund is subject to the risk of counterparty failure or the inability or refusal by a counterparty to perform with respect to such contracts market illiquidity or disruption could result in major losses to an investment fund european economic risk european financial markets have recently experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns about rising government debt levels credit rating downgrades and possible default on or restructuring of government debt these events have affected the value and exchange rate of the euro investing in eurodenominated or other european currencydenominated securities also entails the risk of being exposed to a currency that may not fully reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the disparate european economies the governments of several member countries of the european union eu have experienced large public budget deficits which have adversely affected the sovereign debt issued by those countries and may ultimately lead to declines in the value of the euro it is possible that eu member countries that have already adopted the euro could abandon the euro and return to a national currency andor that the euro will cease to exist as a single currency in its current form the effects of such an abandonment or a countrys forced expulsion from the euro on that country the rest of the eu and global markets are impossible to predict but are likely to be negative the exit of any country out of the euro would likely have an extremely destabilizing effect on all eurozone countries and their economies and a negative effect the global economy as a whole in addition under these circumstances it may be difficult to value investments denominated in euros or in a replacement currency fund borrowings the fund may borrow money in connection with its investment activities  ie the fund may utilize leverage specifically the fund may borrow money through a credit facility or other arrangements to manage timing issues in connection with the acquisition of its investments ie to provide the fund with temporary liquidity to acquire investments in investment funds in advance of the funds receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more investment funds or the receipt of proceeds from the sale of additional shares the fund also may borrow money to fund repurchase payments to shareholders pending the receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more investment funds see investment programleverage the use of leverage is speculative and involves certain risks although leverage will increase the funds investment return if the funds interest in an investment fund purchased with borrowed funds earns a greater return than the interest expense the fund pays for the use of those funds the use of leverage will decrease the return on the fund if the fund fails to earn as much on its investment purchased with borrowed funds as it pays for the use of those funds the use of leverage will in this way magnify the volatility of changes in the value of an investment in the fund especially in times of a credit crunch or during general market turmoil such as that experienced during late  the fund may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with its borrowings or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit either of these requirements would increase the cost of borrowing over the stated interest rate in addition a lender to the fund may terminate or refuse to renew any credit facility into which the fund has entered if the fund is unable to access additional credit it may be forced to redeem investments in investment funds at inopportune times or may be unable to make investments in investment funds at opportune times which may further depress the returns of the fund the  acts asset coverage requirement requires a registered investment company to satisfy an asset coverage requirement of  of its indebtedness including amounts borrowed measured at the time the investment company incurs the indebtedness this requirement means that the value of the investment companys total indebtedness may not exceed onethird of the value of its total assets including the indebtedness the funds borrowings will at all times be subject to the asset coverage requirement      in addition to borrowing money the fund may also incur leveraged exposure via the use of derivatives these instruments may nevertheless in some cases involve significant risks of loss leverage utilized by investment funds the investment funds may also utilize leverage in their investment activities specifically some or all of the investment funds may make margin purchases of securities and in connection with these purchases borrow money from brokers and banks for investment purposes investment funds that utilize leverage are subject to the same risks as the fund with respect to its use of leverage as set forth above and may also be subject to the following additional risks trading equity securities on margin involves an initial cash requirement representing at least a percentage of the underlying securitys value borrowings to purchase equity securities typically will be secured by the pledge of those securities the financing of securities purchases may also be effected through reverse repurchase agreements with banks brokers and other financial institutions in the event that an investment funds equity or debt instruments decline in value the investment fund could be subject to a margin call or collateral call under which the investment fund must either deposit additional collateral with the lender or suffer mandatory liquidation of the pledged securities to compensate for the decline in value in the event of a sudden precipitous drop in value of an investment funds assets the investment fund might not be able to liquidate assets quickly enough to pay off its borrowing in the recent market turmoil during late  numerous hedge funds faced margin calls and were required to sell large portions of their investments in rapid fashion so as to meet these calls in addition the ongoing market turmoil and weakened position of many financial services companies have forced many such companies to reduce or terminate the credit they have extended to hedge funds which has in turn forced many hedge funds to deleverage in similar fashion a substantial number of hedge funds have been forced to liquidate as a result if an investment fund is required to deleverage in such fashion its returns will likely be substantially reduced and it may be forced to liquidate entirely if it cannot meet its margin calls or otherwise cover its outstanding indebtedness in addition legal and regulatory changes applicable to hedge funds andor financial services companies generally may either force investment funds to deleverage or otherwise limit their ability to utilize leverage see other risks  legal and regulatory risks the asset coverage requirement does not apply to investment funds accordingly the funds portfolio may be exposed to the risk of leveraged investment programs of certain investment funds and the volatility of the value of shares may be greater in seeking leveraged market exposure in certain investments and in attempting to increase overall returns an investment fund may purchase options and other synthetic instruments that may involve leveraged exposure and may in some cases involve significant risks of loss especially in highly volatile market conditions such as those currently being experienced small and medium capitalization issuers certain investment funds may invest in the securities of companies with small to mediumsized capitalizations while the securities of such companies often provide significant potential for appreciation smallercapitalization securities involve higher risks in some respects than do investments in the securities of larger companies for example prices of smallcapitalization and even mediumcapitalization securities are often more volatile than prices of largecapitalization securities and the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency of many smaller companies with the attendant losses to investors is higher than that for larger bluechip companies in addition due to thin trading in some smallcapitalization securities an investment in such securities may be relatively illiquid nondiversified status the fund is a nondiversified investment company for purposes of the  act which means that it is not subject to percentage limitations under the  act on the      percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of any one issuer the funds net asset value may therefore be subject to greater volatility than that of an investment company that is subject to such a limitation on diversification in addition while the fund is a nondiversified fund for purposes of the  act the fund has elected and intends to qualify to be treated as a ric under the code to qualify as a ric under the code the fund must among other things i derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined in the code and ii diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of each taxable year a at least  of the market value of the funds assets is represented by cash cash items us government securities securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities with such other securities of any one issuer limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than  of the value of the funds total assets and  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and b not more than  of the market value of the funds total assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities and the securities of other regulated investment companies of  any one issuer  any two or more issuers that the fund controls and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses or  any one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships in addition the adviser typically endeavors to limit investments in any one investment fund to no more than  of the funds gross assets measured at the time of purchase and to limit investments in any one investment manager to no more than  of the funds gross assets measured at the time of purchase the fund intends to distribute at least annually all or substantially all of its net investment income as dividends to shareholders however this policy may be changed at any time by the fund reverse repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements involve a sale of a security by an investment fund to a bank or securities dealer and the investment funds simultaneous agreement to repurchase the security for a fixed price reflecting a market rate of interest on a specific date these transactions involve a risk that the other party to a reverse repurchase agreement will be unable or unwilling to complete the transaction as scheduled which may result in losses to the investment fund reverse repurchase transactions are a form of leverage that may also increase the volatility of an investment funds investment portfolio purchasing initial public offerings the investment funds may purchase securities of companies in initial public offerings of any equity security new issues or shortly thereafter special risks associated with these securities may include a limited number of shares available for trading unseasoned trading lack of investor knowledge of the company and limited operating history these factors may contribute to substantial price volatility for the shares of these companies and thus the fund the limited number of shares available for trading in some initial public offerings may make it more difficult for an investment fund to buy or sell significant amounts of shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices in addition some companies in initial public offerings are involved in relatively new industries or lines of business which may not be widely understood by investors some of these companies may be undercapitalized or regarded as developmental stage companies without revenues or operating income or the nearterm prospects of achieving them special investment instruments and techniques investment funds may utilize a variety of special investment instruments and techniques described below to hedge the portfolios of the investment funds against various risks such as changes in interest rates or other factors that affect security values or for nonhedging purposes in seeking to achieve an investment funds investment objective the adviser on behalf of the fund may also use certain of these special investment instruments and techniques for either hedging or nonhedging purposes as described below these strategies may be executed through derivative transactions instruments used and      the particular manner in which they may be used may change over time as new instruments and techniques are developed or regulatory changes occur certain of these special investment instruments and techniques are speculative and involve a high degree of risk particularly in the context of nonhedging transactions derivatives the fund and some or all of the investment funds may invest in or enter into derivatives or derivatives transactions derivatives derivatives are financial instruments that derive their performance at least in part from the performance of an underlying asset index or interest rate derivatives entered into by an investment fund or the fund can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk depending upon the characteristics of a particular derivative and the portfolio of the investment fund or the fund as a whole derivatives permit an investment manager or the adviser to increase or decrease the level of risk of an investment portfolio or change the character of the risk to which an investment portfolio is exposed in much the same way as the manager can increase or decrease the level of risk or change the character of the risk of an investment portfolio by making investments in specific securities derivatives may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest meaning that a small investment in derivatives could have a large potential effect on the performance of an investment fund or the fund the advisers use of derivatives may include total return swaps options and futures designed to replicate the performance of a particular investment fund or an investment funds underlying investments for example where an investment fund is concentrated in a given sector the adviser may enter into these types of derivatives where for example an investment fund in which the fund would like to invest does not have sufficient capacity for a direct investment on the part of the fund the adviser may also enter into derivatives to adjust market or risk exposure generally if an investment fund or the fund invests in derivatives at inopportune times or incorrectly judges market conditions the investments may lower the return of the investment fund or the fund or result in a loss an investment fund or the fund also could experience losses if derivatives are poorly correlated with its other investments or if the investment fund or the fund is unable to liquidate the position because of an illiquid secondary market and an inability to terminate the derivatives contract the market for many derivatives is or suddenly can become illiquid changes in liquidity may result in significant rapid and unpredictable changes in the prices for derivatives with respect to derivatives involving high yield and other debt securities an investment fund or the fund will usually have a contractual relationship only with the counterparty of the derivative and not with the issuer of the indebtedness an investment fund generally will have no right to directly enforce compliance by the issuer with the terms of a derivative nor any rights of setoff against the issuer nor have any voting rights with respect to the indebtedness an investment fund will not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the underlying indebtedness and will not have the benefit of the remedies that would normally be available to a holder of the indebtedness in addition in the event of the insolvency of the counterparty to the derivative the investment fund will be treated as a general creditor of such counterparty and will not have any claim with respect to the underlying indebtedness consequently the investment fund will be subject to the credit risk of the counterparty as well as that of the issuer of the indebtedness as a result concentrations of such derivatives in any one counterparty subject the investment fund andor the fund to an additional degree of risk with respect to defaults by such counterparty as well as by the issuer of the underlying indebtedness futures an investment fund may purchase and sell single stock futures or stock index futures to hedge the equity portion of its investment portfolio with regard to market systemic risk or to gain market exposure to that portion of the market represented by the futures contracts an investment fund may also purchase and sell other futures when deemed appropriate in order to hedge the equity or nonequity portions of its portfolio in addition to the extent that an investment fund invests in foreign securities and foreign currencies an investment fund may enter into contracts for the future delivery of foreign currencies to hedge against changes in currency exchange rates subject to compliance with applicable rules and restrictions investment funds also may enter into futures contracts traded on foreign futures exchanges      an investment fund may purchase and sell futures contracts on debt securities and on indices of debt securities in order to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates that might otherwise have an adverse effect upon the value of an investment funds securities an investment fund may also enter into such futures contracts for other appropriate risk management income enhancement and investment purposes there are several risks associated with the use of futures contracts and options on futures contracts as hedging techniques there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at the time when an investment fund seeks to close out a futures contract if no liquid market exists an investment fund would remain obligated to meet margin requirements until the position is closed futures may involve a small initial investment relative to the risk assumed which could result in losses greater than if they had not been used there can be no guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the hedging vehicle and in an investment funds securities being hedged even if the hedging vehicle closely correlates with the investment funds investments such as with single stock futures contracts if the price of a futures contract changes more than the price of the securities or currencies an investment fund will experience either a loss or a gain on the futures contracts that will not be completely offset by changes in the price of the securities or currencies that are the subject of the hedge in addition there are significant differences between the securities and futures markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between the markets causing a given hedge not to achieve its objectives options trading certain of the investment managers may engage in options trading as a part of their investment program options trading increases the possibilities of gain and the risk of loss the use of option transactions may increase the adverse impact to which an investment funds portfolio may be subject if the investment managers evaluation of the various factors involved in particular securities transactions is incorrect warrants and rights warrants are derivatives that permit but do not obligate their holder to subscribe for other securities or commodities rights are similar to warrants but normally have a shorter duration and are offered or distributed to shareholders of a company warrants and rights do not carry with them the right to dividends or voting rights with respect to the securities that they entitle the holder to purchase and they do not represent any interest in the assets of the issuer as a result warrants and rights may be considered more speculative than certain other types of equitylike securities in addition the values of warrants and rights do not necessarily change with the values of the underlying securities or commodities and these instruments cease to have value if they are not exercised prior to their expiration dates swap agreements the fund or an investment fund may enter into equity interest rate and index and currency rate swap agreements these transactions will be undertaken in attempting to obtain a particular return when it is considered desirable to do so possibly at a lower cost than if the fund or an investment fund had invested directly in the asset that yielded the desired return swap agreements are twoparty contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than a year in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or differentials in rates of return earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments which may be adjusted for an interest factor the gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount that is the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate in a particular nonus currency or in a basket of securities representing a particular index      most swap agreements entered into by the fund or an investment fund would require the calculation of the obligations of the parties to the agreements on a net basis consequently current obligations or rights under a swap agreement generally will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement the net amount the risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited to the net amount of interest payments that the fund or the investment fund is contractually obligated to make if the other party to a swap defaults the funds or the investment funds risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the fund or the investment fund contractually is entitled to receive to achieve investment returns equivalent to those achieved by an investment manager in whose investment fund the fund could not invest directly perhaps because of its investment minimum or its unavailability for direct investment the fund may enter into one or more swap agreements under which the fund may agree on a net basis to pay a return based on a floating interest rate and to receive the total return of the reference investment fund over a stated time period the fund may seek to achieve the same investment result through the use of other derivatives in similar circumstances the us federal income tax treatment of swap agreements and other derivatives as described above is unclear swap agreements and other derivatives used in this manner may be treated as a constructive ownership of the reference property which may result in a portion of any longterm capital gain being treated as ordinary income the funds obligations under a swap agreement will be accrued daily offset against any amounts owed to the fund and any accrued but unpaid net amounts owed to a swap counterparty will be covered by the maintenance of a segregated account consisting of cash or liquid securities to avoid any potential leveraging of the fund to the extent that the funds derivatives are entered into for hedging purposes the adviser believes that such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the  act and accordingly will not treat them as being subject to the funds borrowing restrictions in a credit default swap the credit default protection buyer makes periodic payments known as premiums to the credit default protection seller in return the credit default protection seller will make a payment to the credit default protection buyer upon the occurrence of a specified credit event a credit default swap can refer to a single issuer or asset a basket of issuers or assets or index of assets each known as the reference entity or underlying asset an investment fund may act as either the buyer or the seller of a credit default swap credit default swaps allow an investment fund to acquire or reduce credit exposure to a particular issuer asset or basket of assets if a swap agreement calls for payments by the investment fund the investment fund must be prepared to make such payments when due if the investment fund is the credit default protection seller the investment fund will experience a loss if a credit event occurs and the credit of the reference entity or underlying asset has deteriorated if the investment fund is the credit default protection buyer the investment fund will be required to pay premiums to the credit default protection seller lending portfolio securities investment funds may lend their securities to brokers dealers and other financial institutions needing to borrow securities to complete certain transactions the lending investment fund continues to be entitled to payments in amounts equal to the interest dividends or other distributions payable in respect of the loaned securities which affords the investment fund an opportunity to earn interest on the amount of the loan and on the loaned securities collateral in connection with any such transaction the investment fund will receive collateral consisting of cash us government securities or irrevocable letters of credit that will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least  of the current market value of the loaned securities an investment fund might experience loss if the institution with which the investment fund has engaged in a portfolio loan transaction breaches its agreement with the investment fund      whenissued and forward commitment securities investment funds may purchase securities on a whenissued basis and may purchase or sell securities on a forward commitment basis in order to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates and prices these transactions involve a commitment by an investment fund to purchase or sell securities at a future date ordinarily one or two months later the price of the underlying securities which is generally expressed in terms of yield is fixed at the time the commitment is made but delivery and payment for the securities takes place at a later date no income accrues on securities that have been purchased pursuant to a forward commitment or on a whenissued basis prior to delivery to the investment fund whenissued securities and forward commitments may be sold prior to the settlement date if an investment fund disposes of the right to acquire a whenissued security prior to its acquisition or disposes of its right to deliver or receive against a forward commitment it may incur a gain or loss the risk exists that securities purchased on a whenissued basis may not be delivered and that the purchaser of securities sold by an investment fund on a forward basis will not honor its purchase obligation in such cases an investment fund may incur a loss restricted and illiquid investments the adviser anticipates that most investment funds will invest primarily in publicly traded securities however some investment funds may invest a portion of the value of their total assets in restricted securities and other investments that are illiquid to the extent that an investment fund invests in restricted or other illiquid securities the valuation of such securities will be determined by the applicable investment manager whose determination will be final and conclusive as to all parties the value established may not reflect accurately the amount that could be realized if the securities were sold restricted securities are securities that may not be sold to the public without an effective registration statement under the  act or that may be sold only in a privately negotiated transaction or pursuant to an exemption from registration when registration is required to sell a security an investment fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a considerable period may elapse between the decision to sell and the time the investment fund may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if adverse market conditions developed during this period an investment fund might obtain a less favorable price than the price that prevailed when the investment fund decided to sell investment funds may be unable to sell restricted and other illiquid securities at the most opportune times or at prices approximating the value at which they purchased the securities the funds interests in investment funds are themselves illiquid and subject to substantial restrictions on transfer the funds ability to liquidate an interest in an investment fund will likely be limited the fund is subject to certain investment funds initial lockup periods beginning at the time of the funds initial investment in an investment fund during which the fund may not withdraw its investment in addition certain investment funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions such as those experienced by many hedge funds in late  investment funds may impose gates and also assess fees for redemptions or other withdrawals the limited liquidity of these investment funds interests may adversely affect the fund were it to have to sell or redeem such interests at an inopportune time the fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in investment funds in a timely manner some of the investment funds may hold a portion of their assets in side pockets which are subaccounts within the investment funds in which certain assets which generally are illiquid andor hard to value are held and segregated from the investment funds other assets until some type of realization event occurs side pockets thus have restricted liquidity potentially extending over a much longer period than the typical liquidity an investment in the investment funds may provide should the fund seek to liquidate its investment in an investment fund that maintains these side pockets the fund      might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay which could be considerable in such cases until the fund is permitted to fully liquidate its interest in the investment fund the value of its investment in such investment fund could fluctuate based on adjustments to the fair value of the side pocket as determined by the investment manager in addition if an investment fund establishes a side pocket prior to the funds investing in the investment fund the fund may not be exposed to the performance of the investment funds assets held in the side pocket counterparty credit risk many of the markets in which the fund and the investment funds effect their transactions are overthecounter or interdealer markets the participants in these markets are typically not subject to credit evaluation and regulatory oversight as are members of exchange based markets to the extent the fund or an investment fund invests in swaps derivatives or synthetic instruments or other overthecounter transactions in these markets the fund or investment fund may take a credit risk with regard to parties with which it trades and also may bear the risk of settlement default these risks may differ materially from those involved in exchangetraded transactions which generally are characterized by clearing organization guarantees daily markingtomarket and settlement and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries transactions entered into directly between two counterparties generally do not benefit from these protections which in turn may subject the fund or an investment fund to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract or because of a credit or liquidity problem such counterparty risk is increased for contracts with longer maturities when events may intervene to prevent settlement the ability of the fund and the investment funds to transact business with any one or any number of counterparties the lack of any independent evaluation of the counterparties or their financial capabilities and the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses by the fund in addition the fund and the investment funds are subject to the risk that a counterparty may be unable to settle a transaction due to such counterpartys insolvency inability to access sufficient credit or other business factors an investment fund may be subject to risk of loss of its assets on deposit with a broker in the event of the brokers bankruptcy the bankruptcy of any clearing broker through which the broker executes and clears transactions on behalf of the investment fund or the bankruptcy of an exchange clearing house although the commodity exchange act requires a commodity broker to segregate the funds of its customers if a commodity broker fails to properly segregate customer funds the investment fund may be subject to a risk of loss of its funds on deposit with such broker in the event of such brokers bankruptcy or insolvency the investment fund may be subject to risk of loss of its funds on deposit with foreign brokers because foreign regulatory bodies may not require such brokers to segregate customer funds the investment fund may be required to post margin for its foreign exchange transactions either with its broker or other foreign exchange dealers who are not required to segregate funds although such funds are generally maintained in separate accounts on the foreign exchange dealers books and records in the name of the investment fund under certain circumstances such as the inability of another customer of the commodity broker or foreign exchange dealer or the commodity broker or foreign exchange dealer itself to satisfy substantial deficiencies in such other customers account the investment fund may be subject to a risk of loss of its funds on deposit with such broker or dealer even if such funds are properly segregated in the case of any such bankruptcy or customer loss the investment fund might recover even if respect of property specifically traceable to the investment fund only a pro rata share of all property available for distribution to all of such brokers or dealers customers prime brokers and custodians under arrangements between the investment funds and their prime brokers or custodians the prime brokers and custodians generally will have the right to i identify as collateral ii rehypothecate or iii otherwise use for their own purposes assets held by them for the investment funds legal and beneficial title to such assets may therefore be transferred to the relevant prime broker and custodian similarly any cash of the investment funds held or received by or on behalf      of a prime broker or custodian may not be treated as client money and may not be subject to the client money protections conferred by the client rules of finra or equivalent rules of other regulators to which such prime broker or custodian may be subject accordingly the cash of the investment funds may also constitute collateral and may not be segregated from the cash of the prime brokers and custodians consequently investment funds may rank as an unsecured creditor in respect of such assets and cash on the insolvency of a prime broker and custodian and might not be able to recover such assets and cash in full the inability of investment funds to recover such cash could have a material adverse effect on the funds performance and returns to shareholders commodity futures contracts trading in commodity interests may involve substantial risks the low margin or premiums normally required in such trading may provide a large amount of leverage and a relatively small change in the price of a security or contract can produce a disproportionately larger profit or loss there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for commodity futures contracts or options purchased or sold and an investment fund may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration which could result in losses futures positions may be illiquid because for example most us commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits once the price of a contract for a particular future has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in the future can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures contract prices on various commodities or financial instruments occasionally have moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading similar occurrences could prevent an investment fund from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and could subject such investment fund and therefore the fund to substantial losses in addition investment funds may not be able to execute futures contract trades at favorable prices if trading volume in such contracts is low it is also possible that an exchange or the commodity futures trading commission the cftc may suspend trading in a particular contract order immediate liquidation and settlement of a particular contract or order that trading in a particular contract be conducted for liquidation only trading in commodity futures contracts and options is a highly specialized activity which may entail greater than ordinary investment or trading risks the price of stock index futures contracts may not correlate perfectly with the movement in the underlying stock index because of certain market distortions first all participants in the futures market are subject to margin deposit and maintenance requirements rather than meeting additional margin deposit requirements investors may close futures contracts through offsetting transactions which would distort the normal relationship between the index and futures markets secondly from the point of view of speculators the deposit requirements in the futures market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities market therefore increased participation by speculators in the futures market also may cause temporary price distortions successful use of stock index futures contracts by an investment fund also is subject to its investment managers ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the market under cftc regulations futures commission merchants fcms are required to maintain a clients assets in a segregated account if a fcm used by an investment fund fails to properly segregate the investment fund may be subject to a risk of loss of the margin on deposit with the fcm in the event of the fcms bankruptcy in addition under certain circumstances such as the inability of another client of the fcm or the fcm itself to satisfy substantial deficiencies in such other clients account the investment fund may be subject to a risk of loss of its margin on deposit with its fcm even if such margin funds are properly segregated in the case of any such bankruptcy or other client loss the investment fund might recover even in respect of property specifically traceable to the investment fund only a pro rata share of all property available for distribution to all of the fcms clients and the fund may suffer a loss as a result      nonus futures transactions investment funds may invest in nonus commodity futures contracts and in options thereon nonus futures transactions involve executing and clearing trades on a nonus exchange this is the case even if the nonus exchange is formally linked to a us exchange whereby a trade executed on one exchange liquidates or establishes a position on the other exchange no us organization regulates the activities of a nonus exchange including the execution delivery and clearing of transactions on such an exchange and no us regulator has the power to compel enforcement of the rules of the nonus exchange or the laws of nonus countries moreover such laws or regulations will vary depending on the country in which the transaction occurs for these reasons investment funds which trade on nonus exchanges may not be afforded certain of the protections which apply to us commodity futures transactions including the right to use us alternative dispute resolution procedures in particular funds received from investment funds to margin nonus futures transactions may not be provided the same protections as funds received to margin futures transaction on us exchanges in addition the price of any nonus futures or option contract and therefore the potential profit and loss resulting therefrom may be affected by any fluctuation in the nonus exchange rate between the time the order is placed and the nonus futures contract is liquidated or the nonus option contract is liquidated or exercised possible effects of speculative position limits the cftc and the us commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or short speculative futures positions that any person may hold or control in derivatives traded on us commodities exchanges all accounts owned or managed by a commodity trading adviser its principals and their affiliates generally will be combined for position limit purposes because futures position limits allow a commodity trading advisor its principals and their affiliates to control only a limited number of contracts in any one commodity each investment manager and its principals and affiliates are potentially subject to a conflict among the interests of all accounts the investment manager and its principals and their affiliates control which are competing for shares of that limited number of contracts although each investment manager may be able to achieve the same or similar performance results with otc substitutes for futures contracts the otc market may be subject to differing prices lesser liquidity and greater counterparty credit risks than on us commodities exchanges each investment manager may be required to reduce the size or number of positions that would otherwise be held for an investment fund or not trade in certain markets on behalf of the investment fund in order to avoid exceeding such limits modification of trades that would otherwise be made by an investment fund if required could adversely affect the investment funds operations and profitability a violation of speculative position limits by an investment manager could lead to regulatory action materially adverse to an investment funds prospects for profitability the speculative position limits of the cftc and us commodities exchanges are subject to change any new or additional position limits imposed on an investment manager and its principal and affiliates may impact the investment funds ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective other instruments and future developments an investment fund may take advantage of opportunities in the area of swaps options on various underlying instruments and certain other customized synthetic or derivative instruments which will be subject to varying degrees of risk in addition an investment fund may take advantage of opportunities with respect to certain other synthetic or derivative instruments which are not presently contemplated or which are not presently available but which may be developed and which may be subject to significant degrees of risk hedging limitations although the adviser may seek one or more investment managers who employ various hedging techniques the extent and effectiveness of such hedging strategies may vary substantially moreover it will not be a goal of the adviser to retain investment managers who necessarily employ fully hedged or marketneutral strategies most hedging techniques of investment      managers will be directed primarily toward general market risks or certain issuer risks typically there are numerous investment risks which will not be hedged or necessarily capable of being hedged as a practical matter to the extent unhedged investment positions of investment managers will in general be fully exposed to market and investment risks hedging techniques have a variety of limitations hedging against a decline in the value of a portfolio position by selling short for example does not eliminate fluctuations in the values of portfolio positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline but establishes other positions designed to gain from those same developments thus moderating the decline in the overall portfolio positions value hedging through market index options may only protect against an overall market downturn as compared with price declines in specific securities hedge transactions generally also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the portfolio position should increase due to the hedging cost or price decline in the hedging position for a variety of reasons an investment manager may not seek or be able to establish a sufficiently accurate correlation between hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged such imperfect correlation may prevent an investment fund from achieving the intended hedge or may expose the fund to risk of loss such losses can include losses on the hedged position the attempted hedge position or both and could be substantial there can be no assurance therefore that investment positions of investment funds will be significantly hedged against investment risks or that such hedging strategies if any will in fact prove successful tail risk hedging investment funds that pursue a tail risk hedging strategy invest in instruments designed to outperform during periods of market stress such periods may be characterized by among other factors i a significant decline in the equity markets ii a significant widening in credit spreads andor iii a significant increase in market volatility instruments designed to mitigate tail event risk involve a high degree of risk the type frequency and severity of tail events are difficult to predict or model and thus the expected return on an instrument designed to appreciate on the occurrence of any such tail event is difficult to calculate with respect to tail event instruments it is necessary for investment managers to rely on information provided by a counterparty or independent source such as an index that may not be accurate and the investment manager may not be able to verify or challenge the information securities that are linked to tail events may in the future have novel features or nonstandardized terms an investment fund risks the loss of all or a portion of principal andor interest due on the tail eventlinked securities it may purchase if a period of severe market stress fails to occur during the term of such securities modeldriven strategies such as a tail risk hedging strategy may not achieve their intended results whether due to unusual or changing market conditions or relationships and may also involve frequent trading and transaction expenses risks of fund of hedge funds structure the investment funds are not registered as investment companies under the  act the fund as an investor in these investment funds does not have the benefit of the protections afforded by the  act to investors in registered investment companies see other riskslegal and regulatory risks although the adviser periodically receives information from each investment fund regarding its investment performance and investment strategy the adviser may have little or no means of independently verifying this information an investment fund may use proprietary investment strategies that are not fully disclosed to the adviser which may involve risks under some market conditions that are not anticipated by the adviser investment managers may change their investment strategies ie may experience style drift at any time in addition the investment funds are organized and managed by persons having no affiliation with the adviser accordingly the fund will be subject to the judgment success and ability of the investment managers of those investment funds the adviser may not have complete information concerning the specific investments made by and will have no management authority or control over the      investment managers the fund will be subject to restrictions on its ability to withdraw or reduce capital that has been invested in any investment fund therefore the adviser may be unable to react rapidly to market changes should an investment manager fail to effect portfolio changes consistent with such market changes andor the intentions of the adviser investment funds will generally be required by contract applicable law or otherwise to make limited disclosures only to their investors including the fund regarding their operations and performance and as a result transparency of such information to the adviser will be limited accordingly the adviser will not be in a position to analyze or respond to developments within any particular investment fund unless and until information relating thereto is disseminated by the investment manager to its investors including the fund such information may not necessarily be timely or complete the fund will conduct due diligence which the adviser believes is adequate to select investment funds and investment managers with which to invest fund assets however due diligence is not foolproof and may not uncover problems associated with a particular investment fund or investment manager the fund may rely upon representations made by hedge fund managers accountants attorneys prime brokers andor other investment professionals if any such representations are misleading incomplete or false this may result in the selection of investment funds and investment managers which might otherwise have been eliminated from consideration had fully accurate and complete information been made available to the fund similarly the adviser conducts ongoing due diligence in an effort to detect material changes in an investment fund or investment managers personnel or operations which could be material to the fund however such diligence may not be effective in identifying all material problems before they occur the fund will only invest in investment funds whose portfolios are valued by independent third parties in addition the policies and procedures approved by the funds board of trustees provide that the adviser will review the valuations provided by the investment managers to the investment funds however neither the adviser nor the board of trustees will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by the investment managers which are unaudited in addition although the adviser intends to employ reasonable diligence in evaluating and monitoring investment funds and investment managers no amount of diligence can eliminate the possibility that one or more investment funds or investment managers may engage in improper or fraudulent conduct including unauthorized changes in investment strategy misappropriation of assets and unsupportable valuations of portfolio securities the investment funds typically do not maintain their securities and other assets in the custody of a bank or a member of a securities exchange as generally required of registered investment companies it is anticipated that the investment funds in which the fund invests generally will maintain custody of their assets with brokerage firms which do not separately segregate such customer assets as required in the case of registered investment companies under the provisions of the securities investor protection act of  as amended the bankruptcy of any such brokerage firm could have a greater adverse effect on the fund than would be the case if custody of assets were maintained in accordance with the requirements applicable to registered investment companies there is also a risk that an investment manager could convert assets committed to it by the fund for its own use or that a custodian could convert assets committed to it by an investment manager to its own use an investor in the fund meeting the eligibility conditions imposed by the investment funds including minimum initial investment requirements that may be substantially higher than those imposed by the fund could invest directly in the investment funds by investing in the investment funds via the fund an investor in the fund bears a portion of the advisers management fee and other expenses of the fund and also indirectly bears a portion of the assetbased fees incentive feesallocations and other expenses borne by the fund as an investor in the investment funds each investment manager receives any incentivebased feesallocations to which it is entitled irrespective of the performance of the other investment funds and the fund generally as a result an investment manager with positive performance      may receive compensation from the fund in the form of the assetbased fees incentivebased fees and other expenses payable by the fund as an investor in the relevant investment fund even if the funds overall returns are negative investment decisions of the investment funds are made by the investment managers independently of each other so that at any particular time one investment fund may be purchasing shares in an issuer that at the same time are being sold by another investment fund transactions of this sort could result in the fund directly or indirectly incurring certain transaction costs without accomplishing any net investment result which may result in the pursuit of opposing investment strategies or result in performance that correlates more closely with broader market performances hidden correlations between investment funds may occur if two or more investment funds are purchasing the same securities because the fund may make additional investments in or redemptions from investment funds only at certain times according to limitations set out in the governing documents of the investment funds the fund from time to time may have to invest some of its assets temporarily in money market securities or money market funds among other similar types of investments investment funds may permit or require that redemptions of interests be made in kind upon its redemption of all or a portion of its interest in an investment fund the fund may receive securities that are illiquid or difficult to value in such a case the adviser would seek to cause the fund to dispose of these securities in a manner that is in the best interest of the fund the fund may not be able to withdraw from an investment fund except at certain designated times limiting the ability of the adviser to redeem assets from an investment fund that may have poor performance or for other reasons other risks that the adviser believes are associated with the funds fund of hedge funds investment approach include technological failures the successful deployment of an investment funds trading systems the implementation and operation of these trading systems and any future trading systems and various other critical activities of the investment managers could be severely compromised by unforeseeable software or hardware malfunction and other technological failures power loss software bugs and errors malicious code such as worms viruses or system crashes fire or water damage or various other events or circumstances either within or beyond the investment managers control software bugs and errors in particular and their ensuing risks are an inherent part of technologybased analytics systems and models any event that interrupts an investment managers computer andor telecommunications operations could result in among other things the inability to establish modify liquidate or monitor the investment funds investments and for those and other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the operating results financial condition activities and prospects of the investment fund and thus the fund valuation the fund of hedge funds approach places certain constraints on the advisers ability to value the assets of the fund while the fund will receive annual audited financial statements for each investment fund and will review the valuations provided by the investment managers to the investment funds and while the fund will only invest in investment funds whose portfolios are valued by independent third parties neither the adviser nor the board of trustees will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by the investment managers which are unaudited certain securities and other financial instruments in which the investment funds invest may not have a readily ascertainable market price and will be valued pursuant to policies and procedures established by the investment managers in most cases the adviser will have no ability to assess the accuracy of the valuations received from an investment fund in addition the net asset values or other valuation information received by the adviser from the investment funds will typically be estimates only subject to revision through the end of each investment funds annual audit revisions to the gain and loss calculations will be an ongoing process and no net capital appreciation or depreciation figure can be considered final until the annual audit of each investment fund is completed      securities believed to be undervalued or incorrectly valued an investment manager may invest in securities that an investment manager believes are fundamentally undervalued or incorrectly valued but such securities may not ultimately be valued in the capital markets at prices andor within the timeframe the investment manager anticipates as a result the fund may lose all or substantially all of its investment in an investment fund in any particular instance investment funds turnover rates the investment funds may invest on the basis of shortterm market considerations the turnover rate within the investment funds may be significant potentially involving substantial brokerage commissions and fees the fund has no control over this turnover as a result it is anticipated that a significant portion of the funds income and gains if any may be derived from ordinary income and shortterm capital gains in addition the redemption by the fund of its interest in an investment fund could involve expenses to the fund under the terms of the funds investment with that investment fund investment managers may have limited capacity to manage additional fund investments certain investment managers trading approaches presently can accommodate only a certain amount of capital each investment manager will normally endeavor not to undertake to manage more capital than such investment managers approach can accommodate without risking a potential deterioration in returns as a result an investment manager may refuse to manage some or all of the funds assets that the adviser seeks to allocate to such investment manager further in the case of investment managers that limit the amount of additional capital that they will accept from the fund continued sales of shares would dilute the indirect participation of existing shareholders with such investment manager conversely an investment manager may accept more capital than the investment manager can prudently manage investments in nonvoting stock limitations on voting investment funds may consistent with applicable law not disclose the contents of their portfolios this lack of transparency may make it difficult for the adviser to monitor whether holdings of the investment funds cause the fund to be above specified levels of ownership in certain asset classes to avoid adverse regulatory consequences in such a case the fund may need to hold its interest in an investment fund in nonvoting form additionally in order to avoid becoming subject to certain  act prohibitions with respect to affiliated transactions the fund intends to own less than  of the voting securities of each investment fund this limitation on owning voting securities is intended to ensure that an investment fund is not deemed an affiliated person of the fund for purposes of the  act which may among other things potentially impose limits on transactions with the investment funds both by the fund and other clients of the adviser to limit its voting interest in certain investment funds the fund may enter into contractual arrangements under which the fund irrevocably waives its rights if any to vote all or a portion of its interest in an investment fund the fund will not receive any consideration in return for entering into a voting waiver arrangement other investment funds or accounts managed by the adviser may also waive their voting rights in a particular investment fund subject to the oversight of the funds board of trustees the adviser will decide whether to waive such voting rights and in making these decisions will consider the amounts if any invested by the adviser in the particular investment fund these voting waiver arrangements may increase the ability of the fund to invest in certain investment funds however to the extent the fund contractually foregoes the right to vote all or a portion of its interest in an investment fund the fund will not be able to vote at all or to the fullest possible extent on matters that require the approval of the interestholders of the investment fund including matters adverse to the funds interests this restriction could diminish the influence of the fund in an investment fund as compared to other investors in the investment fund which could include other investment funds or accounts managed by the adviser if they do not waive their voting rights in the investment fund and adversely affect the funds investment in the investment fund which could result in unpredictable and potentially adverse effects on shareholders there are however other statutory tests of affiliation such as on the basis of control and therefore the prohibitions of the  act with respect to affiliated transactions could apply      in some situations where the fund owns less than  of the voting securities of an investment fund in these circumstances transactions between the fund and an investment fund may among other things potentially be subject to the prohibitions of section  of the  act notwithstanding that the fund has entered into a voting waiver arrangement risk management the sophistication of the risk management techniques employed by investment managers varies however even the most sophisticated risk management techniques cannot protect an investment fund against loss in all circumstances all risk management models are premised upon assumptions with respect to economic and political conditions market sentiment and other factors the occurrence of an aberrational event not anticipated by a model can cause a portfolio to sustain a significant loss such events may include volatility in energy prices sharp swings in interest rates or other factors other risks investing in the fund involves risks other than those associated with investments made by investment funds including those described below limited operating history the fund is a newlyorganized nondiversified closedend management investment company with no operating history that investors can use to evaluate its investment performance in addition investment funds andor investment managers with whom the fund may invest may in some cases be newly organized with limited operating histories upon which to evaluate their performance performance incentive arrangements each investment manager may receive a performance or incentive feeallocation of generally  of net profits of the investment fund that it manages these performance incentives may create an incentive for the investment managers to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than those that might have been made in the absence of the performance or incentive fee allocation in addition these performance incentives will be calculated on a basis that includes realized and unrealized appreciation of assets and may be greater than if it were based solely on realized gains availability of investment opportunities the business of identifying and structuring investments of the types contemplated by the fund is competitive and involves a high degree of uncertainty the availability of investment opportunities generally is subject to market conditions as well as in some cases the prevailing regulatory or political climate no assurance can be given that the fund will be able to identify and complete attractive investments in the future or that it will be able to invest fully its subscriptions similarly identification of attractive investment opportunities by investment funds is difficult and involves a high degree of uncertainty even if an attractive investment opportunity is identified by an investment manager an investment fund may not be permitted to take advantage of the opportunity to the fullest extent desired other investment vehicles sponsored managed or advised by the adviser and its affiliates may seek investment opportunities similar to those the fund may be seeking the adviser will allocate fairly between the fund and such other investment vehicles any investment opportunities that may be appropriate for the fund and such other investment vehicles control positions investment funds may take control positions in companies the exercise of control over a company imposes additional risks of liability for environmental damage product defects failure to supervise and other types of liability related to business operations in addition the act of taking a control position or seeking to take such a position may itself subject an investment fund to litigation by parties interested in blocking it from taking that position if those liabilities were to arise or such litigation were to be resolved adversely to the investment funds the investing investment funds likely would suffer losses on their investments      inadequate return no assurance can be given that the returns on the funds investments will be commensurate with the risk of investment in the fund investors should not commit money to the fund unless they have the resources to sustain the loss of their entire investment in the fund inside information from time to time the fund or its affiliates may come into possession of material nonpublic information concerning an entity in which the fund has invested or proposes to invest possession of that information may limit the ability of the fund to buy or sell securities of the entity recourse to the funds assets the funds assets including any investments made by the fund and any interest in the investment funds held by the fund are available to satisfy all liabilities and other obligations of the fund if the fund becomes subject to a liability parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to the funds assets generally and not be limited to any particular asset such as the asset representing the investment giving rise to the liability possible exclusion of a shareholder based on certain detrimental effects the fund may repurchase shares held by a shareholder or other person acquiring shares from or through a shareholder if        the shares have been transferred or have vested in any person other than by operation of law as the result of the death dissolution bankruptcy insolvency or adjudicated incompetence of the shareholder        ownership of the shares by the shareholder or other person likely will cause the fund to be in violation of require registration of any shares under or subject the fund to additional registration or regulation under the securities commodities or other laws of the united states or any other relevant jurisdiction        continued ownership of the shares by the shareholder or other person may be harmful or injurious to the business or reputation of the fund the board of trustees the adviser or any of their affiliates or may subject the fund or any shareholder to an undue risk of adverse tax or other fiscal or regulatory consequences        any of the representations and warranties made by the shareholder or other person in connection with the acquisition of the shares was not true when made or has ceased to be true        the shareholder is subject to special regulatory or compliance requirements such as those imposed by the bank holding company act certain federal communications commission regulations or erisa as hereinafter defined collectively special laws or regulations and the fund determines that the shareholder is likely to be subject to additional regulatory or compliance requirements under these special laws or regulations by virtue of continuing to hold the shares or        the fund or the board of trustees determine that the repurchase of the shares would be in the best interest of the fund the effect of these provisions may be to deprive an investor in the fund of an opportunity for a return even though other investors in the fund might enjoy such a return      limitations on transfer shares not listed no market for shareholder shares no shareholder is permitted to transfer his her or its shares without the consent of the fund the transferability of shares is subject to certain restrictions contained in the funds agreement and declaration of trust and is affected by restrictions imposed under applicable securities laws shares are not traded on any securities exchange or other market no market currently exists for shares and the fund contemplates that one will not develop the shares are therefore not readily marketable although the adviser and the fund expect to recommend to the board of trustees that the fund offer to repurchase shares quarterly no assurances can be given that the fund will do so consequently shares should only be acquired by investors able to commit their funds for an indefinite period of time closedend fund liquidity risks the fund is a nondiversified closedend management investment company designed primarily for longterm investors and is not intended to be a trading vehicle an investor should not invest in the fund if the investor needs a liquid investment closedend funds differ from openend management investment companies commonly known as mutual funds in that investors in a closedend fund do not have the right to redeem their shares on a daily basis at a price based on net asset value repurchase risks with respect to any future repurchase offer shareholders tendering any shares for repurchase must do so by a date specified in the notice describing the terms of the repurchase offer the notice date the notice date generally will be  days prior to the date as of which the shares to be repurchased are valued by the fund the valuation date tenders will be revocable upon written notice to the fund up to  days prior to the valuation date shareholders that elect to tender any shares for repurchase will not know the price at which such shares will be repurchased until the funds net asset value as of the valuation date is able to be determined which determination is expected to be able to be made only late in the month following that of the valuation date it is possible that during the time period between the expiration date and the valuation date general economic and market conditions or specific events affecting one or more underlying investment funds could cause a decline in the value of shares in the fund in addition the fund is subject to certain investment funds initial lockup periods beginning at the time of the funds initial investment in an investment fund during which the fund may not withdraw its investment in addition certain investment funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions such as those experienced by many hedge funds in late  during such periods the fund thus may not be able to liquidate its holdings in such investment funds in order to meet repurchase requests in addition should the fund seek to liquidate its investment in an investment fund that maintains a side pocket the fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay which could be considerable the fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in investment funds in a timely manner see redemptions repurchases and transfers of shares substantial repurchases substantial requests for the fund to repurchase shares could require the fund to liquidate certain of its investments more rapidly than otherwise desirable in order to raise cash to fund the repurchases and achieve a market position appropriately reflecting a smaller asset base this could have a material adverse effect on the value of the shares to the extent the fund obtains repurchase proceeds by disposing of its interest in certain investment funds the fund will thereafter hold a larger proportion of its assets in the remaining investment funds some of whose interests at times may be less liquid or illiquid this could adversely affect the ability of the fund to fund subsequent repurchase requests of shareholders or to conduct future repurchases at all in addition after giving effect to such dispositions the remaining investment funds may not reflect the advisers ideal judgments as to the desired portfolio composition of the funds investment funds in that the funds performance may be tied to the performance of fewer investment funds andor may not reflect the advisers judgment as to the funds optimal exposure to particular asset classes or investment strategies these consequences may be particularly applicable if the fund receives requests to repurchase substantial amounts of shares and may have a material adverse effect on the      funds ability to achieve its investment objective and the value of the shares in addition substantial repurchases of shares could result in a sizeable decrease in the funds net assets resulting in an increase in the funds total annual operating expense ratio potential significant effect of the performance of a limited number of investments or strategies the adviser expects that the fund will participate in multiple investments the fund may however make investments in a limited number of investment funds and investment funds may make investments in a limited number of portfolio companies in either instance these limited numbers of investments may have a significant effect on the performance of the fund special tax risks special tax risks are associated with an investment in the fund the fund has elected to and intends to meet the requirements necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company or ric under subchapter m of the code as such the fund must satisfy among other requirements certain ongoing asset diversification sourceofincome and annual distribution requirements each of these ongoing requirements for qualification for the favorable tax treatment available to rics requires that the fund obtain information from the investment funds in which the fund is invested if before the end of any quarter of its taxable year the fund believes that it may fail the asset diversification requirement the fund may seek to take certain actions to avert such a failure the fund may try to acquire additional interests in investment funds to bring itself into compliance with the asset diversification test however the action frequently taken by rics to avert such a failure the disposition of nondiversified assets may be difficult for the fund to pursue because the fund may redeem its interest in an investment fund only at certain times specified by the governing documents of each respective investment fund while relevant provisions also afford the fund a day period after the end of the relevant quarter in which to cure a diversification failure by disposing of nondiversified assets the constraints on the funds ability to effect a redemption from an investment fund referred to above may limit utilization of this cure period if the fund fails to satisfy the asset diversification or other ric requirements it may lose its status as a ric under the code in that case all of its taxable income would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders in addition all distributions including distributions of net capital gain would be taxed to their recipients as dividend income to the extent of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits accordingly disqualification as a ric would have a material adverse effect on the value of the funds shares and the amount of the funds distributions additional tax considerations distributions to shareholders and payment of tax liability the fund will distribute substantially all of its net investment income and gains to shareholders these distributions are taxable as ordinary income or capital gains to the shareholder shareholders may be proportionately liable for taxes on income and gains of the fund but shareholders not subject to tax on their income will not be required to pay tax on amounts distributed to them the fund will inform shareholders of the amount and character of its distributions to shareholders see tax considerations below for more information if the fund distributes less than an amount equal to the sum of  of its ordinary income and  of its capital gain net income plus any such amounts that were not distributed in previous tax years then the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax with respect to the funds nondistributed amounts in addition the fund invests in investment funds located outside the us such investment funds may be subject to withholding tax on their investments in such jurisdictions any such withholding tax would reduce the return on the funds investment in such investment funds and thus on the shareholders investment in the fund see tax considerations      legal and regulatory risks legal tax and regulatory changes as well as judicial decisions could adversely affect the fund the adviser the investment funds the investment managers andor the investment strategies used to implement the investment funds trading programs the regulatory environment for private investment funds continues to evolve and changes in the regulation of private investment funds may adversely affect the value of the funds investments and the ability of the fund to implement its investment strategy including the use of leverage the financial services industry generally and the activities of private investment funds such as the investment funds and their investment managers in particular have been the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory scrutiny such scrutiny may increase an investment funds andor an investment managers legal compliance administrative and other related burdens and costs as well as regulatory oversight or involvement in an investment fund andor an investment manager or result in ambiguity or conflict among legal or regulatory schemes applicable to an investment fund andor an investment manager the regulation of the us and nonus securities and futures markets and investment funds such as the fund has undergone substantial change in recent years and such change may continue in particular the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act was signed into law in july  the doddfrank act contains changes to the existing regulatory structure in the united states and is intended to establish rigorous oversight standards to protect the us economy and american consumers investors and businesses the doddfrank act requires additional regulation of hedge fund managers including requirements for such managers to register as investment advisers under the advisers act and to disclose various information to regulators about the positions counterparties and other exposures of the hedge funds managed by such managers the doddfrank act significantly alters the regulation of commodity interests and comprehensively regulates the overthecounter derivatives markets for the first time in the us provisions in the new law include new registration requirements with the sec andor the cftc recordkeeping capital and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations and the requirement that certain standardized overthecounter derivatives be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing through regulated clearinghouses overthecounter derivatives transactions traded through clearinghouses will be subject to margin requirements set by clearinghouses and possibly to additional requirements set by the sec andor the cftc regulators also have discretion to set margin requirements for overthecounter derivative transactions that do not take place through clearinghouses overthecounter derivatives dealers will be required to post margin to the clearinghouses through which they clear their customer trades instead of using such margin in their operations as they are currently permitted to do this will increase the dealers costs and may be passed through to other market participants such as an investment fund in the form of higher fees or spreads and less favorable dealer valuations the adviser on behalf of the fund has claimed a temporary exemption from the definition of the term commodity pool operator cpo under the commodity exchange act cea therefore neither the fund nor the adviser with respect to the fund is currently subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool or cpo under the cea when the temporary exemption expires to the extent the fund is not otherwise eligible to claim an exclusion from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc the fund will operate subject to cftc regulation if the adviser and fund become subject to cftc regulation as well as related national futures association rules the fund may incur additional compliance and other expenses the implementation of the doddfrank act will occur based on the adoption of various regulations and reports to be prepared by various agencies over a period of time it is unknown in what form when and in what order significant regulatory initiatives may be implemented or the impact any such implemented regulations will have on investment funds andor investment managers and in turn the fund the markets or instruments in which investment funds invest or the counterparties with whom      investment funds conduct business the effect of the doddfrank act or other regulatory change on the fund andor investment funds while impossible to predict could be substantial and adverse in addition the practice of short selling has been the subject of numerous temporary restrictions and similar restrictions may be promulgated at any time such restrictions may adversely affect the returns of investment funds that utilize short selling see types of investments and related risks  investment related risks  short sales certain tax risks associated with an investment in the fund are discussed in tax considerations limits of risk disclosures the above discussions of the various risks associated with the fund and the shares

their own advisors before deciding whether to invest in the fund in addition as the funds investment program changes or develops over time an investment in the fund may be subject to risk factors not described in this prospectus the fund will update this prospectus to account for any material changes in the risks involved with an investment in the fund management of the fund general the funds

basis of the value of the funds month end net assets the management fee is an expense paid out of the funds assets the management fee is computed based on the value of the net assets of the fund as of the close of business on the last business day of each month including any assets in respect of shares that will be repurchased by the fund as of the end of the month and is due and payable in arrears within ten business days after the end of the month adviser payments the adviser may pay additional compensation out of its own funds and not as an additional charge to the fund to selected brokers dealers or other financial intermediaries intermediaries for the purpose of introducing a ria to the fund andor promoting the recommendation of shares of the fund by a ria such payments are made quarterly by the adviser the payments made by the adviser may be based on the net asset value of the fund as determined by the adviser the amount of these payments is determined from time to time by the adviser and may be substantial such additional compensation to the intermediary will not exceed      of the average net asset value of the outstanding shares beneficially owned over the applicable quarter      on an annualized basis by clients of the ria by virtue of the efforts of such intermediary      calculation of net asset value the value of the funds net assets is determined as of the close of the funds business at the end of each month in accordance with the procedures described below or as may be determined from time to time in accordance with the valuation policies and procedures adopted by the board of trustees the board of trustees has approved procedures pursuant to which the fund values its investments in investment funds at fair value which ordinarily will be the value provided to the fund by the investment funds investment managers from time to time usually monthly in accordance with these procedures fair value as of each monthend ordinarily will be the value determined as of such monthend for each investment fund in accordance with the investment funds valuation policies and reported at the time of the funds valuation because most investment managers will provide the fund with their determinations of the monthend net asset value of their investment funds after the relevant monthend the fund expects to calculate its monthend net asset value and net asset value per share within  business days following the relevant monthend this information will be available to shareholders upon request as a general matter the fair value of the funds interest in an investment fund will represent the amount that the fund could reasonably expect to receive from an investment fund if the funds interest were redeemed at the time of valuation based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the fund believes to be reliable in the event that an investment fund does not report a monthend value to the fund on a timely basis the fund would determine the fair value of such investment fund based on the most recent final or estimated value reported by the investment fund as well as any other relevant information available at the time the fund values its portfolio using the nomenclature of the hedge fund industry any values reported as estimated or final values will reasonably reflect market values of securities for which market quotations are available or fair value as of the funds valuation date prior to investing in any investment fund the adviser will conduct a due diligence review of the valuation methodology utilized by the investment fund which as a general matter will utilize market values when available and otherwise utilize principles of fair value that the adviser reasonably believes to be consistent with those used by the fund for valuing its own investments in addition the fund will only invest in investment funds whose portfolios are valued by independent third parties in addition the procedures approved by the board of trustees provide that the adviser will review the valuations provided by the investment managers to the investment funds however neither the adviser nor the board of trustees will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by such investment managers which are unaudited accordingly the valuations of the investment manager generally will be relied upon by the fund the funds valuation procedures require the adviser to consider all relevant information available at the time the fund values its portfolio the adviser andor the board of trustees will consider such information and may conclude in certain circumstances that the information provided by the investment manager of an investment fund does not represent the fair value of the funds interest in the investment fund although redemptions of investments in investment funds are subject to advance notice requirements investment funds will typically make available net asset value information to holders which will represent the price at which even in the absence of redemption activity the investment fund would have effected a redemption if any such requests had been timely made or if in accordance with the terms of the investment funds governing documents it would be necessary to effect a mandatory redemption following procedures adopted by the board of trustees in the absence of specific transaction activity in the investment in a particular investment fund the fund would consider whether it was appropriate in light of all relevant circumstances to value such a position at its net asset value as reported at the time of valuation or whether to adjust such value to reflect a premium or discount      to net asset value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and industry practice the fund may not always apply a discount in cases where there was no contemporaneous redemption activity in a particular investment fund in other cases as when an investment fund imposes extraordinary restrictions on redemption or when there have been no recent transactions in investment fund interests the fund may determine that it was appropriate to apply a discount to the net asset value of the investment fund any such decision would be made in good faith and subject to the review and supervision of the board of trustees the valuations reported by the investment managers of the investment funds upon which the fund calculates its monthend net asset value may be subject to later adjustment based on information reasonably available at that time for example fiscal yearend net asset value calculations of the investment funds are audited by their independent auditors and may be revised as a result of such audits other adjustments may occur from time to time because such adjustments or revisions whether increasing or decreasing the net asset value of the fund at the time they occur relate to information available only at the time of the adjustment or revision the adjustments or revisions will not affect the amount of the repurchase proceeds of the fund received by shareholders who had their shares repurchased prior to such adjustments and received their repurchase proceeds as a result to the extent that such subsequently adjusted valuations from the investment managers or revisions to net asset value of an investment fund adversely affect the funds net asset value the outstanding shares will be adversely affected by prior repurchases to the benefit of shareholders who had their shares repurchased at a net asset value higher than the adjusted amount conversely any increases in the net asset value resulting from such subsequently adjusted valuations will be entirely for the benefit of the outstanding shares and to the detriment of shareholders who previously had their shares repurchased at a net asset value lower than the adjusted amount the same principles apply to the purchase of shares new shareholders may be affected in a similar way to the extent the adviser invests the assets of the fund in securities or other instruments that are not investments in investment funds the fund will generally value such assets as described below        us exchange listed and nasdaq traded equity securities other than options will be valued at their closing sale prices as reported on the exchange on which those securities are primarily traded if no sales of those securities are reported on a particular day the securities will be valued based upon their composite bid prices for securities held long or their composite ask prices for securities held short as reported by those exchanges securities traded on a nonus securities exchange will be valued at their closing sale prices on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular day at their bid prices in the case of securities held long or ask prices in the case of securities held short as reported by that exchange listed options will be valued at their bid prices or ask prices in the case of listed options held short as reported by the exchange with the highest volume on the last day a trade was reported other securities for which market quotations are readily available will be valued at their bid prices or ask prices in the case of securities held short as obtained from one or more dealers making markets for those securities if market quotations are not readily available securities and other assets will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the supervision of the board of trustees        debt securities other than convertible debt securities will be valued in accordance with the procedures described above which with respect to these securities may include the use of valuations furnished by a pricing service that employs a matrix to determine valuations for normal institutional size trading units the board of trustees will regularly monitor the methodology and procedures used in connection with valuations provided by the pricing service debt securities with remaining maturities of  days or less will absent unusual circumstances be valued at amortized cost so long as this method of valuation is determined by the board of trustees to represent fair value           if in the view of the adviser the bid price of a listed option or debt security or ask price in the case of any such security held short does not fairly reflect the market value of the security the adviser may request a valuation committee to instead adopt procedures to be used by the adviser if so delegated by the board of trustees and in accordance with procedures adopted by the board of trustees to value the security at fair value subject to the oversight of the valuation committee        all assets and liabilities initially expressed in nonus currencies will be converted into us dollars using nonus exchange rates provided by a pricing service compiled as of  noon new york time trading in nonus securities generally is completed and the values of nonus securities are determined prior to the close of securities markets in the united states nonus exchange rates are also determined prior to such close on occasion the values of nonus securities and exchange rates may be affected by significant events occurring between the time as of which determination of values or exchange rates are made and the time as of which the net asset value of the fund is determined when an event materially affects the values of securities held by the fund or its liabilities the securities and liabilities will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the supervision of the board of trustees in general fair value represents a good faith determination of the current value of an asset or with regard to a short sale a liability and will be used when there is no public market or possibly no market at all for the asset or with regard to a short sale the liability the fair values of one or more assets or with regard to short sales liabilities may not be the prices at which those assets or with regard to short sales liabilities are ultimately sold in such circumstances the adviser andor the board of trustees will reevaluate its fair value methodology to determine what if any adjustments should be made to the methodology expenses of the fund including the management fee and the costs of any borrowings are accrued on a monthly basis on the day net asset value is calculated and taken into account for the purpose of determining net asset value prospective investors should be aware that situations involving uncertainties as to the value of portfolio positions could have an adverse effect on the funds net assets if the judgments of the board of trustees the adviser or investment managers to the investment funds should prove incorrect also investment managers to the investment funds will only provide determinations of the net asset value of investment funds on a weekly or monthly basis in which event it will not be possible to determine the net asset value of the fund more frequently conflicts of interest the adviser and its affiliates as well as many of the investment managers and their respective affiliates manage other accounts including other funds and accounts in which the investment managers may have an interest other than the fund and the investment funds collectively other accounts other accounts together with the investment funds could increase the level of competition for the same trades including the priorities of order entry this could make it difficult or impossible for an investment fund to take or liquidate a position in a particular security at a price indicated by an investment managers strategy      in addition investment professionals associated with investment managers may employ different trading methods policies and strategies for different funds or accounts therefore the results of an investment funds trading may differ from those of the other accounts traded by the same investment manager as the funds under management by a particular investment manager increase the investment manager may have increasing difficulty implementing an investment strategy which may have been successful in the past or difficulty finding sufficient investment opportunities which are attractive alternatively an investment manager who has been successful may limit the amount of capital it is willing to manage and may decline to accept an additional investment from the fund there can be no assurances that an investment managers future results will be as successful as his or her past performance moreover even where an investment manager has achieved excellent results over an extended period because of cyclical movements and volatility period to period results may differ materially accordingly the adviser believes that an investment in the fund is suitable only for those investors who intend to make a longterm investment in the fund the results of the funds investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by the adviser and its affiliates or an investment manager for their other accounts it is possible that the adviser or an investment manager will achieve investment results with respect to one or more other accounts that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by the fund moreover it is possible that the fund will sustain losses during periods in which the adviser or an investment manager achieves significant profits on their trading with respect to one or more other accounts the opposite result is also possible the investment activities of the adviser or an investment manager for other accounts may also limit the investment opportunities for the fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment in the aggregate or in individual issuers by related foreign investors there may be circumstances under which the adviser or an investment manager will cause one or more other accounts to commit a larger percentage of their assets to an investment opportunity than the percentage of the funds or an investment funds assets they commit to such investment there also may be circumstances under which the adviser or an investment manager purchases or sells an investment for their other accounts and does not purchase or sell the same investment for the fund or an investment fund or purchases or sells an investment for the fund and does not purchase or sell the same investment for one or more other accounts however it is the policy of the adviser and generally also the policy of the investment managers that investment decisions for the fund and other accounts be made based on a consideration of their respective investment objectives and policies and other needs and requirements affecting each account that they manage and investment transactions and opportunities be fairly allocated among their clients including the fund the adviser investment managers and their respective affiliates may have interests in other accounts they manage which differ from their interests in the fund and investment funds and may manage such accounts on terms that are more favorable to them than the terms on which they manage the fund or investment funds in addition the adviser and investment managers may charge fees to other accounts and be entitled to receive performancebased incentive allocations from other accounts that are lower than the fees to which the fund and its shareholders are subject      purchases of shares purchase terms subsequent to the initial closing date the fund will accept initial and additional purchases of shares as of the first business day of each calendar month the investor must submit a completed application form eight business days before the applicable purchase date all purchases are subject to the receipt of immediately available funds four business days prior to the applicable purchase date in the full amount of the purchase to enable the fund to invest the proceeds in investment funds as of the applicable purchase date an investor who misses one or both of these deadlines will have the effectiveness of its investment in the fund delayed until the following month despite having to meet the earlier application and funding deadlines described above the fund does not issue the shares purchased and an investor does not become a shareholder with respect to such shares until the applicable purchase date ie the first business day of the relevant calendar month consequently purchase proceeds do not represent capital of the fund and do not become assets of the fund until such date any amounts received in advance of the initial or subsequent purchases of shares are placed in a noninterestbearing account with the transfer agent as defined herein prior to their investment in the fund in accordance with rule c under the securities exchange act of  as amended the fund reserves the right to reject any purchase of shares in certain limited circumstances including without limitation when it has reason to believe that a purchase of shares would be unlawful unless otherwise required by applicable law any amount received in advance of a purchase ultimately rejected by the fund will be returned to the prospective investor the minimum initial investment in the fund from each investor is  and the minimum additional investment in the fund is  the minimum initial and additional investments may be reduced by the fund with respect to certain individual investors or classes of investors specifically with respect to employees officers or trustees of the fund the adviser or their affiliates additionally the fund may waive or reduce such minimum initial and additional investment amounts as well as the application and funding deadlines described above with respect to any investor funding its purchase of shares with redemption proceeds from another fund sponsored managed or advised by the adviser the fund will notify shareholders of any changes in the investors that are eligible for such reductions the fund may repurchase all of the shares held by a shareholder if the shareholders account balance in the fund as a result of repurchase or transfer requests by the shareholder is less than          initial and any additional purchases of shares of the fund by any shareholder must be made via wire transfer of funds payment for each initial or subsequent additional purchases of shares must be made in one installment to help the us government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account what this means to you when you open an account we will ask your name address date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you if we are unable to verify your identity we reserve the right to restrict additional transactions andor liquidate your account at the next calculated net asset value after your account is closed less any applicable salesaccount charges andor tax penalties or take any other action required by law the fund has implemented an antimoney laundering compliance program which includes designation of an antimoney laundering compliance officer      eligible investors each investor in the fund will be required to certify to the fund that the shares are being acquired for the account of both i an accredited investor as defined in rule a of regulation d promulgated under the  act and ii a qualified client as defined in rule d under the advisers act investors who are both accredited investors and qualified clients are referred to in this prospectus as eligible investors existing shareholders who subscribe for additional shares will be required to qualify as eligible investors at the time of each additional purchase qualifications that must be met in becoming a shareholder are set out in the application form that must be completed by each prospective investor any other registered investment adviser a ria who offers shares may impose additional eligibility requirements on investors who purchase shares through such ria see plan of distribution repurchases and transfers of shares no right of redemption no shareholder or other person holding shares acquired from a shareholder has the right to require the fund to redeem any shares no public market for shares exists and none is expected to develop in the future consequently shareholders may not be able to liquidate their investment other than as a result of repurchases of shares by the fund as described below repurchases of shares the fund may from time to time repurchase shares from shareholders in accordance with written tenders by shareholders at those times in those amounts and on those terms and conditions as the board of trustees may determine in its sole discretion each such repurchase offer will generally be limited to up to  of the net assets of the fund in determining whether the fund should offer to repurchase shares from shareholders the board of trustees will consider the recommendation of the adviser the adviser expects that generally it will recommend to the board of trustees that the fund offer to repurchase shares from shareholders quarterly with such repurchases to occur as of each march  june  september  and december  or if any such date is not a business day as of the immediately preceding business day each repurchase offer will generally commence approximately  days prior to the applicable repurchase date a  early repurchase fee repurchase fee will be charged to any shareholder that tenders its shares to the fund prior to the business day immediately preceding the oneyear anniversary of the shareholders purchase of the respective shares the repurchase fee would apply separately to each purchase of shares made by a shareholder for example if a shareholder purchases shares in january of year  and then purchases additional interests in december of year  such shareholder would be subject to an early repurchase fee on the additional shares purchased in december of year  until december of year  the purpose of the repurchase fee is to reimburse the fund for the costs incurred in liquidating securities in the funds portfolio in order to honor the shareholders repurchase request and to discourage shortterm investments which are generally disruptive to the funds investment program in determining whether to accept a recommendation to conduct a repurchase offer at any such time the board of trustees will consider the following factors among others        whether any shareholders have requested to tender shares to the fund        the liquidity of the funds assets including fees and costs associated with redeeming or otherwise withdrawing from investment funds           the investment plans and working capital and reserve requirements of the fund        the relative economies of scale of the tenders with respect to the size of the fund        the history of the fund in repurchasing shares        the availability of information as to the value of the funds shares in underlying investment funds        the existing conditions of the securities markets and the economy generally as well as political national or international developments or current affairs        any anticipated tax consequences to the fund of any proposed repurchases of shares and        the recommendations of the adviser the first offer to repurchase shares from shareholders is expected to occur on or about               the fund will repurchase shares from shareholders pursuant to written tenders on terms and conditions that the board of trustees determines to be fair to the fund and to all shareholders when the board of trustees determines that the fund will repurchase shares notice will be provided to shareholders describing the terms of the offer containing information shareholders should consider in deciding whether to participate in the repurchase opportunity and containing information on how to participate shareholders deciding whether to tender their shares during the period that a repurchase offer is open may obtain the funds net asset value per share by contacting the adviser during the period if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by shareholders who tender shares the fund may repurchase a pro rata portion of the shares tendered by each shareholder extend the repurchase offer or take any other action with respect to the repurchase offer permitted by applicable law repurchases of shares from shareholders by the fund will be paid in cash repurchases will be effective after receipt and acceptance by the fund of eligible written tenders of shares from shareholders by the applicable repurchase offer deadline the fund does not impose any charges in connection with repurchases of shares except for the repurchase fee described above shares will be repurchased by the fund after the management fee has been deducted from the funds assets as of the end of the month in which the repurchase occurs  ie the accrued management fee for the month in which fund shares are to be repurchased is deducted prior to effecting the relevant repurchase of fund shares in light of liquidity constraints associated with the funds investments in investment funds and the fact that the fund may have to effect redemptions from investment funds in order to pay for shares being repurchased the fund expects to employ the following repurchase procedures        each repurchase offer will generally commence approximately  days prior to the applicable repurchase date a shareholder choosing to tender shares for repurchase must do so by the applicable deadline which generally will be  days before the date as of which shares are to be repurchased the notice date shares will be valued as of the valuation date which is generally expected to be march  june  september  or december  or if such day is not a business day as of the immediately preceding business day tenders will be revocable upon written notice to the fund up to  days prior to the valuation date such deadline for revocation being the expiration date if a repurchase offer is extended the expiration date will be extended accordingly           promptly after the expiration date the fund will give to each shareholder whose shares have been accepted for repurchase a promissory note the promissory note entitling the shareholder to be paid an amount equal to the value determined as of the valuation date of the repurchased shares the determination of the value of shares as of the valuation date is subject to adjustment based upon the results of the next annual audit of the funds financial statements        the promissory note which will be noninterest bearing and nontransferable is expected to contain terms providing for payment at two separate times as is customary regarding such payments        the initial payment in respect of the promissory note the initial payment will be in an amount equal to at least  of the estimated value of the repurchased shares determined as of the valuation date the initial payment will be made as of the later of  a period of within  days after the valuation date or  if the fund has requested redemptions of its capital from any investment funds in order to fund the repurchase of shares within ten business days after the fund has received at least  of the aggregate amount redeemed by the fund from the investment funds        the second and final payment in respect of the promissory note the postaudit payment is expected to be in an amount equal to the excess if any of  the value of the repurchased shares determined as of the valuation date and based upon the results of the annual audit of the funds financial statements for the year in which the valuation date occurs over  the initial payment it is anticipated that the annual audit of the funds financial statements will be completed within  days after the end of each fiscal year of the fund and that the postaudit payment will be made promptly after the completion of the audit if modification of the funds repurchase procedures as described above is deemed necessary to comply with regulatory requirements the board of trustees will adopt revised procedures reasonably designed to provide shareholders substantially the same liquidity for shares as would be available under the procedures described above the fund is subject to certain investment funds initial lockup periods beginning at the time of the funds initial investment in an investment fund during which the fund may not withdraw its investment in addition certain investment funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions such as those experienced by many hedge funds since in  during such periods the fund thus may not be able to liquidate its holdings in such investment funds in order to meet repurchase requests in addition should the fund seek to liquidate its investment in an investment fund that maintains a side pocket the fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay which could be considerable the fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in investment funds in a timely manner upon its acceptance of tendered shares for repurchase the fund will maintain daily on its books a segregated account consisting of  cash  liquid securities or  interests in investment funds that the fund has requested be redeemed or any combination of them in an amount equal to the aggregate estimated unpaid dollar amount of the promissory notes issued to shareholders tendering shares payment for repurchased shares may require the fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the adviser would otherwise have caused these holdings to be liquidated potentially resulting in losses      and may increase the funds investment related expenses as a result of higher portfolio turnover rates the adviser intends to take measures subject to policies as may be established by the board of trustees to attempt to avoid or minimize potential losses and expenses resulting from the repurchase of shares a shareholder tendering for repurchase only a portion of the shareholders shares will be required to maintain an account balance of at least  after giving effect to the repurchase if a shareholder tenders an amount that would cause the shareholders account balance to fall below the required minimum the fund reserves the right to repurchase all of a shareholders shares at any time if the aggregate value of such shareholders shares is at the time of such compulsory repurchase less than the minimum initial investment applicable for the fund this right of the fund to repurchase shares compulsorily may be a factor which shareholders may wish to consider when determining the extent of any tender for purchase by a fund the fund may also repurchase shares of a shareholder without consent or other action by the shareholder or other person if the fund determines that        the shares have been transferred or have vested in any person other than by operation of law as the result of the death bankruptcy insolvency adjudicated incompetence or dissolution of the shareholder        ownership of shares by a shareholder or other person is likely to cause the fund to be in violation of require registration of any shares under or subject the fund to additional registration or regulation under the securities commodities or other laws of the united states or any other relevant jurisdiction        continued ownership of shares by a shareholder may be harmful or injurious to the business or reputation of the fund the board of trustees the adviser or any of their affiliates or may subject the fund or any shareholder to an undue risk of adverse tax or other fiscal or regulatory consequences        any of the representations and warranties made by a shareholder or other person in connection with the acquisition of shares was not true when made or has ceased to be true        with respect to a shareholder subject to special laws or regulations the shareholder is likely to be subject to additional regulatory or compliance requirements under these special laws or regulations by virtue of continuing to hold any shares or        it would be in the best interests of the fund for the fund to repurchase the shares in the event that the adviser or any of its affiliates holds shares in the capacity of a shareholder the shares may be tendered for repurchase in connection with any repurchase offer made by the fund transfers of shares shares may be transferred only        by operation of law as a result of the death bankruptcy insolvency adjudicated incompetence or dissolution of the shareholder or           under certain limited circumstances with the written consent of the fund which may be withheld in its sole discretion and is expected to be granted if at all only under extenuating circumstances the fund generally will not consent to a transfer of shares by a shareholder unless the transfer is to a transferee that represents that it is an eligible investor and after the transfer the value of the shares held in the account of each of the transferee and transferor is at least  a shareholder transferring shares may be charged reasonable expenses including attorneys and accountants fees incurred by the fund in connection with the transfer in connection with any request to transfer shares the fund may require the shareholder requesting the transfer to obtain at the shareholders expense an opinion of counsel selected by the fund as to such matters as the fund may reasonably request in subscribing for shares a shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the fund the board of trustees the adviser each other shareholder and any of their affiliates against all losses claims damages liabilities costs and expenses including legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending against any losses claims damages liabilities costs and expenses or any judgments fines and amounts paid in settlement joint or several to which those persons may become subject by reason of or arising from any transfer made by that shareholder in violation of these provisions or any misrepresentation made by that shareholder or a substituted shareholder in connection with any such transfer voting each shareholder has the right to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by such shareholder at a meeting of shareholders called by the funds board of trustees shareholders will be entitled to vote on any matter on which shareholders of a registered investment company organized as a corporation would be entitled to vote including certain elections of a trustee and approval of the advisory agreement in each case to the extent that voting by shareholders is required by the  act notwithstanding their ability to exercise their voting privileges shareholders in their capacity as such are not entitled to participate in the management or control of the funds business and may not act for or bind the fund tax considerations the following is a summary of certain us federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition holding and disposition of shares by us shareholders this summary is based upon existing us federal income tax law which is subject to change possibly with retroactive effect this summary does not discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation which may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances including investors subject to special tax rules such as us financial institutions insurance companies brokerdealers taxexempt organizations partnerships shareholders who are not united states persons as defined in the code shareholders liable for the alternative minimum tax persons holding shares through partnerships or other passthrough entities or investors that have a functional currency other than the us dollar all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below this summary assumes that investors have acquired shares pursuant to this offering and will hold their shares as capital assets generally property held for investment for us federal income tax purposes prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the nonus and us federal state and local income and other tax considerations that may be relevant to an investment in the fund in addition to the particular matters set forth in this section taxexempt entities should review carefully those sections of this prospectus and the sai regarding liquidity and other financial matters to ascertain whether the investment objectives of the fund are consistent with their overall investment plans      taxation of the fund the fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company a ric under federal income tax law if the fund so qualifies and distributes each year to its shareholders at least  of its investment company taxable income the fund will not be required to pay federal income taxes on any income it distributes to shareholders if the fund distributes less than an amount equal to the sum of  of its ordinary income and  of its capital gain net income plus any amounts that were not distributed in previous taxable years then the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the undistributed amounts the fund is required to use the accrual method of accounting and expects to use the calendar year as its tax year for income tax purposes as described below under investments in passive foreign investment companies the fund expects to be taxed at ordinary income rates on gains from the investment funds distributions to shareholders shareholders normally will be subject to us federal income taxes and any state andor local income taxes on the dividends and other distributions that they receive from the fund as described below under investments in passive foreign investment companies the fund expects that distributions of both income derived from the investment funds as well as gains from the disposition of the investment funds will be taxable to shareholders at ordinary income rates to the extent of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits such distributions will generally be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income regardless of whether shareholders receive such payments in cash or reinvest the distributions in the fund distributions by the fund in excess of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a taxfree return of capital to the extent of and in reduction of the shareholders tax bases in their shares and any such amount in excess of their bases will be treated as gain from the sale of shares as discussed below if the fund receives distributions of qualified dividend income from the investment funds it could potentially make distributions to shareholders that are taxed at the same rates as longterm capital gains the fund does not expect that it will make distributions to shareholders that are eligible for this reduced rate of taxation shareholders are generally taxed on any ordinary income dividend or capital gain distributions from the fund in the year they are actually distributed however if any such dividends or distributions are declared in october november or december and paid to shareholders of record of such month in january of the following year then such amounts will be treated for tax purposes as having been distributed by the fund and received by the shareholders on december  of the year prior to the date of payment if the fund receives qualifying dividends from its investments it could potentially make distributions that are eligible for the  dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders the fund does not expect that it will make distributions to shareholders that are eligible for this deduction the fund intends to distribute its ordinary income and capital gains at least once annually the fund will inform shareholders of the source and status of each distribution made in a given calendar year promptly after the close of such calendar year see distribution policy      shareholders who are not citizens or residents of the united states generally will be subject to a  us federal withholding tax or us federal withholding tax at such lower rate as prescribed by applicable treaty on distributions of the funds income derived from the investment funds each nonus shareholder must provide documentation to the fund certifying its nonunited states status income from repurchases and transfers of shares the repurchase or transfer of the funds shares may result in a taxable gain or loss to the tendering shareholder different tax consequences may apply for tendering and nontendering shareholders in connection with a repurchase offer for example if a shareholder does not tender all of his or her shares such repurchase may not be treated as an exchange for us federal income tax purposes and may result in deemed distributions to nontendering shareholders on the other hand shareholders who tender all of their shares including shares deemed owned by shareholders under constructive ownership rules will be treated as having sold their shares and generally will realize a capital gain or loss such gain or loss is measured by the difference between the shareholders amount received and his or her adjusted tax basis of the shares for noncorporate shareholders gain or loss from the transfer or repurchase of shares generally will be taxable at a us federal income tax rate dependent upon the length of time the shares were held shares held for a period of one year or less at the time of such repurchase or transfer will for us federal income tax purposes generally result in shortterm capital gains or losses and those held for more than one year will generally result in longterm capital gains or losses investments in passive foreign investment companies the fund intends to purchase interests in investment funds organized outside the united states that are treated as corporations for us tax purposes and that will generally be treated as passive foreign investment companies pfics the fund intends to elect to marktomarket all shares that it holds in pfics at the end of each taxable year by making this election the fund will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares as of the close of the taxable year over their adjusted basis and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value unless the loss is required to be deferred gains realized with respect to pfics that the fund has elected to marktomarket will be ordinary income if the fund realizes a loss with respect to such a pfic whether by virtue of selling the pfic or because of the marktomarket adjustment described above such loss will be ordinary to the extent of the excess of the sum of the marktomarket gains over the marktomarket losses recognized with respect to the pfic to the extent that the funds loss with respect to the pfic exceeds such limitation the loss will generally be deferred until sold at which point the loss will be treated as a capital loss although the fund may only deduct capital losses in a given taxable year to the extent of capital gains the fund may carry forward remaining capital losses for up to  years following the taxable year in which the loss was recognized however the fund does not expect to generate significant capital gains from its investments by making the marktomarket election the fund may be required to recognize income which generally must be distributed to shareholders in excess of the distributions that it received from pfics accordingly the fund may need to borrow money or dispose of its interests in the investment funds in order to make the required distributions if the fund does not make the marktomarket election or treat the pfic as a qualified electing fund qef it would be subject to an interest charge at the rate applicable to tax underpayments on tax liability treated as having been deferred with respect to certain distributions and on gain from the disposition of the shares of a pfic collectively referred to as excess distributions even if such excess distributions are paid by the fund as a dividend to its shareholders fund tax returns and tax information the fund is required to use the accrual method of accounting and expects to use the calendar year as its tax year for income tax purposes      after the end of each calendar year shareholders will be sent information regarding the amount and character of distributions received from the fund during the year state and local taxes in addition to the us federal income tax consequences summarized above prospective investors should consider the potential state and local tax consequences of an investment in the fund the fund may become subject to income and other taxes in states and localities based on the funds investments in entities that conduct business in those jurisdictions shareholders are generally taxable in their state of residence on their share of the funds income shareholders may be subject to tax in other jurisdictions depending on the activities of the investment funds in which the fund invests and the laws of those jurisdictions additionally shareholders may be entitled to a credit in their state of residence for taxes paid to other jurisdictions information reporting and backup withholding information returns generally will be filed with the internal revenue service in connection with distributions with respect to the shares unless shareholders establish that they are exempt from the information reporting rules for example by properly establishing that they are corporations if shareholders do not establish that they are exempt from these rules they generally will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if they fail to provide their taxpayer identification number or otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to shareholders will be allowed as a credit against their us federal income tax liability and may entitle shareholders to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the irs other taxes the foregoing is a summary of some of the tax rules and considerations affecting shareholders and the funds operations and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all relevant tax rules and considerations nor does it purport to be a complete listing of all potential tax risks inherent in making an investment in the fund nonus investors are urged to consult with their own tax advisers regarding any proposed investment in the fund a shareholder may be subject to other taxes including but not limited to state and local taxes estate and inheritance taxes and intangible property taxes that may be imposed by various jurisdictions the fund also may be subject to state local and foreign taxes that could reduce cash distributions to shareholders it is the responsibility of each shareholder to file all appropriate tax returns that may be required each prospective shareholder is urged to consult with his or her tax adviser with respect to any investment in the fund in addition to the particular matters set forth in this section taxexempt entities should review carefully those sections of this prospectus and the sai regarding liquidity and other financial matters to ascertain whether the investment objectives of the fund are consistent with their overall investment plans erisa considerations persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an employee benefit plan individual retirement account ira keogh plan or other arrangement subject to the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa or the code an erisa plan should consider among other things the matters described below before determining whether to invest in the fund erisa imposes certain general and specific responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an erisa plan including prudence diversification prohibited transactions and other standards in determining whether a particular investment is appropriate for an erisa plan department of labor dol regulations      provide that a fiduciary of an erisa plan must give appropriate consideration to among other things the role that the investment plays in the erisa plans portfolio taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the erisa plans purposes an examination of the risk and return factors the portfolios composition with regard to diversification the liquidity and current total return of the portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the erisa plan and the proposed investment in the fund the income taxes of the investment and the projected return of the fund relative to the erisa plans funding objectives before investing the assets of an erisa plan in the fund an erisa plan fiduciary should determine whether such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the foregoing regulations if a fiduciary with respect to any such erisa plan breaches his or her responsibilities with regard to selecting an investment or an investment course of action for such erisa plan the fiduciary may be held personally liable for losses incurred by the erisa plan as a result of such breach because the fund will be registered as an investment company under the  act the underlying assets of the fund will not be considered to be plan assets of the erisa plans investing in the fund for purposes of erisas fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules thus the adviser will not be a fiduciary within the meaning of erisa with respect to the assets of any erisa plan that becomes a shareholder of the fund solely as a result of the erisa plans investment in the fund the board of trustees will require an erisa plan proposing to invest in the fund to represent that it and any fiduciaries responsible for the erisa plans investments are aware of and understand the funds investment objective policies and strategies that the decision to invest plan assets in the fund was made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment factors with regard to the erisa plan and that the decision to invest plan assets in the fund is consistent with the duties and responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries with regard to their investment decisions under erisa certain prospective erisa plan investors may currently maintain relationships with the adviser or one or more investment managers in which the fund invests or with other entities that are affiliated with the adviser or such investment advisers each of such persons may be deemed to be a party in interest to andor a fiduciary of any erisa plan to which it provides investment management investment advisory or other services erisa prohibits erisa plan assets to be used for the benefit of a party in interest and also prohibits an erisa plan fiduciary from using its position to cause the erisa plan to make an investment from which it or certain third parties in which such fiduciary has an interest would receive a fee or other consideration erisa plan investors should consult with legal counsel to determine if participation in the fund is a transaction that is prohibited by erisa or the code erisa plan fiduciaries will be required to represent that the decision to invest in the fund was made by them as fiduciaries that are independent of such affiliated persons that are duly authorized to make such investment decisions and that have not relied on any individualized advice or recommendation of such affiliated persons as a primary basis for the decision to invest in the fund the provisions of erisa are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review the discussion of erisa contained herein is of necessity general and may be affected by future publication of regulations and rulings potential investors should consult with their legal advisers regarding the consequences under erisa of the acquisition and ownership of shares plan of distribution the fund is offering on a continuous basis through the distributor  in shares shares will be offered during an initial public offering period until the initial closing date at an initial offering price of  per share and in a continuous offering at the funds then current net asset value per share investors purchasing shares in the fund will not be charged a sales load the distributor

generally be paid at least annually on the shares in amounts representing substantially all of the net investment income if any earned each year payments will vary in amount depending on investment income received and expenses of operation it is likely that many of the investment funds in whose securities the fund invests will not pay any dividends and this together with the funds relatively high expenses means that there can be no assurance the fund will have substantial income or pay dividends the fund is not a suitable investment for any investor who requires regular dividend income it is anticipated that any gains or appreciation in the funds investments will be treated as ordinary income such amounts will generally be distributed at least annually and such distributions would be taxed as ordinary income dividends to shareholders that are subject to tax it is anticipated that substantially all of any taxable net capital gain realized on investments will be paid to shareholders at least annually the net asset value of each share that you own will be reduced by the amount of the distributions or dividends that you receive from that share automatic dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan established by the fund the drip each shareholder whose shares are registered in its own name will automatically be a participant under the drip and have all income dividends andor capital gains distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares unless such shareholder specifically elects to receive all income dividends andor capital gain distributions in cash a shareholder is free to change this election at any time if however a shareholder requests to change its election within  days prior to a distribution the request will be effective only with respect to distributions after the  day period a shareholder whose shares are registered in the name of a nominee must contact the nominee regarding its status under the drip including whether such nominee will participate on such shareholders behalf a shareholder may elect to        reinvest both dividends and capital gain distributions           receive dividends in cash and reinvest capital gain distributions or        receive both dividends and capital gain distributions in cash generally for us federal income tax purposes shareholders receiving shares under the drip will be treated as having received a distribution equal to the amount payable to them in cash as a distribution had the shareholder not participated in the drip shares will be issued pursuant to the drip at their net asset value determined on the next valuation date following the exdividend date the last date of a dividend period on which an investor can purchase shares and still be entitled to receive the dividend there is no sales load or other charge for reinvestment a request must be received by the fund before the record date to be effective for that dividend or capital gain distribution the fund may terminate the drip at any time any expenses of the drip will be borne by the fund additional information about the fund each fund share represents a proportional interest in

majority of the outstanding voting securities of the fund means the vote at an annual or special meeting of the funds shareholders duly called a of   or more of the voting securities present at

whichever is less the fund may not    invest  or more of the value of its total assets in the securities other than us government securities of issuers engaged in any single industry for purposes of

to the activities and transactions of investment funds as defined below in which assets of the fund are invested    the funds investment objective is fundamental and may not be changed without the vote of a majority of the funds outstanding voting securities as defined by the  act certain portfolio securities and other operating policies as discussed in the prospectus the fund invests substantially all of its assets in private investment funds investment funds managed by a range of alternative asset managers investment managers that employ a variety of investment strategies including but not limited to hedging distressed securities eventdriven and relative valuearbitrage and special situations additional information regarding the types of securities and financial instruments in which investment managers may invest the assets of the investment funds and certain of the investment techniques that may be used by investment managers are set forth below equity securities the investment portfolios of investment funds may include long and short positions in common stocks preferred stocks and convertible securities of us and foreign issuers the value of equity securities depends on business economic and other factors affecting those issuers equity securities fluctuate in value often based on factors unrelated to the value of the issuer of the securities and such fluctuations can be pronounced investment managers may generally invest the assets of investment funds in equity securities without restriction these investments may include securities issued by companies having relatively small market capitalization including micro cap companies the prices of the securities of smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than larger more established companies because these securities typically are traded in lower volume and the issuers typically are more subject to changes in earnings and prospects these securities are also subject to other risks that are less prominent in the case of the securities of larger companies growth investing certain investment funds invest in growth stocks securities of growth companies may be more volatile since such companies usually invest a high portion of earnings in their business and they may lack the dividends of value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market in addition earnings disappointments often lead to sharply falling prices because investors buy growth stocks in anticipation of superior earnings growth value investing certain investment funds invest in value stocks an investment manager to an investment fund may be wrong in its assessment of a companys value and the stocks the investment fund holds may not reach what the investment manager believes are their full values a particular risk of an investment funds value approach is that some holdings may not recover and provide the capital growth anticipated or a stock judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced further because the prices of valueoriented securities tend to correlate more closely with economic cycles than growthoriented securities they generally are more sensitive to changing economic conditions such as changes in interest rates corporate earnings and industrial production the market may not favor valueoriented stocks and may not favor equities at all during those periods the investment funds relative performance may suffer    eventdriven investing eventdriven strategies analyze various transactions in order to predict a likely outcome and commit capital in a way that benefits from that outcome eventdriven strategies are broad in scope and employ a diverse set of securities including common and preferred stock debt securities warrants stubs and derivatives appreciation in the value of such securities may be contingent upon the occurrence of certain events such as a successful reorganization or merger if the expected event does not occur the investment fund may incur a loss on the investments there can be no assurance that any expected transaction will take place certain transactions are dependent on one or more factors to become effective such as market conditions which may lead to unexpected positive or negative changes in a company profile shareholder approval regulatory and various other third party constraints changes in earnings or business lines or shareholder activism as well as many other factors no assurance can be given that the transactions entered into will result in a profitable investment for the investment funds or that the investment funds will not incur substantial losses fixed income securities investment funds may invest in fixed income securities fixed income securities include bonds notes and debentures issued by us and foreign corporations and governments these securities may pay fixed variable or floating rates of interest and may include zero coupon obligations fixed income securities are subject to the risk of the issuers inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations ie credit risk and are subject to the risk of price volatility due to such factors as interest rate sensitivity market perception of the creditworthiness or financial condition of the issuer and general market liquidity ie market risk certain portfolio securities such as those with interest rates that fluctuate directly or indirectly based on multiples of a stated index are designed to be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and can subject the holders thereof to significant reductions of yield and possible loss of principal investment funds may invest in both investment grade and noninvestment grade debt securities investment grade debt securities are securities that have received a rating from at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization a rating agency of one of the four highest rating categories or if not rated by any rating agency have been determined by an investment manager to be of comparable quality an investment funds investments in noninvestment grade debt securities including convertible debt securities are considered by the rating agencies to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal noninvestment grade securities in the lowest rating categories may involve a substantial risk of default or may be in default adverse changes in economic conditions or developments regarding the individual issuer are more likely to cause price volatility and weaken the capacity of the issuers of noninvestment grade securities to make principal and interest payments than is the case for higher grade securities in addition the market for lower grade securities may be thinner and less liquid than the market for higher grade securities for a description of the ratings of the rating agencies see annex b to this sai securities and other obligations of financially distressed companies an investment fund may purchase securities and other obligations of foreign and domestic companies that are experiencing significant financial or business distress including companies involved    in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings these issuers may be in weak financial condition experiencing poor operating results having substantial capital needs or a negative net worth or facing special competitive or product obsolescence problems investments of this type may involve substantial financial and business risks that can result in substantial or at times even total losses under such circumstances the returns generated from the investment funds investments may not compensate the investment fund adequately for the risks assumed acquired investments may include senior or subordinated debt securities bank loans promissory notes and other evidences of indebtedness as well as payables to trade creditors although such purchases may result in significant returns to the investment fund they involve a substantial degree of risk and may not show any return for a considerable period of time in fact many of these securities and investments ordinarily remain unpaid while the company is in bankruptcy and may not ultimately be paid unless and until the company reorganizes andor emerges from bankruptcy proceedings as a result such securities may have to be held for an extended period of time the level of analytical sophistication both financial and legal necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial distress is high there is no assurance that the investment managers will correctly evaluate the nature and magnitude of the various factors that could affect the prospects for a successful reorganization or similar action in any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a company in which an investment fund invests the investment fund may lose its entire investment or may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the investment funds original investment under such circumstances the returns generated from the investment funds investments may not compensate the investment fund adequately for the risks assumed mortgagebacked securities investment funds may invest in mortgagebacked securities the investment characteristics of mortgagebacked securities differ from those of traditional debt securities among the major differences are that interest and principal payments on mortgagebacked securities are made more frequently usually monthly and that principal may be prepaid at any time because the underlying loans or other assets generally may be prepaid at any time the adverse effects of prepayments may indirectly affect the fund in two ways first particular investments may experience outright losses as in the case of an interestonly security in an environment of faster than expected actual or anticipated prepayments second particular investments may underperform relative to hedges that the investment funds may have entered into for these investments resulting in a loss to the investment fund in particular prepayments at par may limit the potential upside of many mortgagebacked securities to their principal or par amounts whereas their corresponding hedges often have the potential for large losses the investment funds may also invest in structured notes variable rate mortgagebacked securities including adjustablerate mortgage securities arms which are backed by mortgages with variable rates and certain classes of collateralized mortgage obligation cmo derivatives the rate of interest payable under which varies with a designated rate or index the value of these investments is closely tied to the absolute levels of such rates or indices or the markets perception of anticipated changes in those rates or indices this introduces additional risk factors related to the movements in specific indices or interest rates that may be difficult or impossible to hedge and which also interact in a complex fashion with prepayment risks mortgagebacked securities are also subject to the risk of delinquencies on mortgage loans underlying such securities an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of a mortgagebacked security and could result in losses to an investment fund socalled subprime mortgages mortgage loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with a lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages have experienced    higher rates of delinquency and such delinquencies have increased dramatically since  these increased mortgage delinquencies have adversely impacted the market for mortgagebacked securities generally including derivatives or other instruments linked to the value of such securities and led to turmoil in the credit markets generally in particular holders of mortgagebacked securities have experienced great difficulty in valuing such securities in light of the dramatically reduced market for mortgagebacked securities see types of investments and related risks  risks of fund of hedge funds structure  valuation in the prospectus asset backed securities the investment funds in which the fund invests may invest in assetbacked securities abs such as residential mortgagebacked securities commercial mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations or synthetic securities with respect to which the reference obligations are abs including credit default swap transactions cds transactions abs are securities that entitle the holders thereof to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flow from among others a a specified pool of financial assets either a fixed pool or a revolving pool that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period together with rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the holders of such securities or b real estate mortgage loans either a fixed pool or a revolving pool together with rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to holders of such securities abs backed by real estate mortgage loans do not entitle the holders thereof to share in the appreciation in value of or in the profits generated by the related real estate assets abs include but are not limited to securities for which the underlying collateral consists of assets such as home equity loans leases residential mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans auto finance receivables credit card receivables and other debt obligations sponsors of issuers of abs are primarily banks and finance companies captive finance subsidiaries of nonfinancial corporations or specialized originators such as credit card lenders abs carry coupons that can be fixed or floating the spread will vary depending on the credit quality of the underlying collateral the degree and nature of credit enhancement and the degree of variability in the cash flows emanating from the securitized assets in the event that spreads on abs widen after acquisition by an underlying hedge fund or portfolio manager the market value of such abs is likely to decline and in the case of a substantial spread widening could decline by a substantial amount holders of abs bear various risks including credit risk liquidity risk interest rate risk market risk operations risk structural risk and legal risk the structure of an abs and the terms of the investors interest in the collateral can vary widely depending on the type of collateral the desires of investors and the use of credit enhancements although the basic elements of all abs are similar individual transactions can differ markedly in both structure and execution important determinants of the risk associated with issuing or holding the securities include the process by which principal and interest payments are allocated and distributed to investors how credit losses affect the issuing vehicle and the return to investors in such abs whether collateral represents a fixed set of specific assets or accounts whether the underlying collateral assets are revolving or closedend under what terms including maturity of the assetbacked instrument any remaining balance in the accounts may revert to the issuing entity and the extent to which the entity that is the actual source of the collateral assets is obligated to provide support to the issuing vehicle or to the investors in such abs all or most of the abs that an investment fund may invest in are subordinate in right of payment and rank junior to other securities that are secured by or represent an ownership interest in the same pool    of assets in addition many of the transactions have structural features that divert payments of interest andor principal to more senior classes when the delinquency or loss experience of the pool exceeds certain levels as a result such securities have a higher risk of loss as a result of delinquencies or losses on the underlying assets in certain circumstances payments of interest may be reduced or eliminated for one or more payment dates additionally as a result of cash flow being diverted to payments of principal on more senior classes the average life of such securities may lengthen subordinate abs generally do not have the right to call a default or vote on remedies following a default unless more senior securities have been paid in full as a result a shortfall in payments to subordinate investors in abs will generally not result in a default being declared on the transaction and the transaction will not be restructured or unwound furthermore because subordinate abs may represent a relatively small percentage of the size of the asset pool being securitized the impact of a relatively small loss on the overall pool may be substantially on the holders of such subordinate security often abs are structured to reallocate the risks entailed in the underlying collateral particularly credit risk into security tranches that match the desires of investors for example senior subordinated security structures give holders of senior tranches greater credit risk protection albeit at lower yields than holders of subordinated tranches under this structure at least two classes of abs are issued with the senior class having a priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying pool of assets the subordinated class must absorb credit losses on the collateral before losses can be allocated to the senior portion because the senior class has this priority claim cash flows from the underlying pool of assets must first satisfy the requirements of the senior class only after these requirements have been satisfied will the cash flows be directed to service the subordinated class investment funds may also enter into cds transactions with respect to which the reference obligations are abs that are subordinate in right of payment and rank junior to other securities that are secured by or represent an ownership interest in the same pool of assets in addition many of the abs that an underlying hedge fund or portfolio manager may invest in may have been issued in transactions that have structural features that divert payments of interest andor principal to more senior classes when the delinquency or loss experience of the pool exceeds certain levels as a result such securities have a higher risk of loss as a result of delinquencies or losses on the underlying assets in certain circumstances payments of interest may be reduced or eliminated for one or more payment dates additionally as a result of cash flow being diverted to payments of principal on more senior classes the average life of such securities may lengthen for example in the case of certain abs type residential securities no distributions of principal will generally be made with respect to any class until the aggregate principal balances of the more senior classes of securities have been reduced to zero subordinate abs generally do not have the right to call a default or vote on remedies following a default unless more senior securities have been paid in full as a result a shortfall in payments to subordinate investors in abs will generally not result in a default being declared on the transaction and the transaction will not be restructured or unwound furthermore because subordinate abs may represent a relatively small percentage of the size of the asset pool being securitized the impact of a relatively small loss on the overall pool may disproportionately affect the holders of such subordinate security commodities certain investment funds may invest directly in commodities rather than gaining exposure to commodities markets by investing in futures contracts unlike financial instruments there are costs of physical storage associated with purchasing a commodity which would not be associated with a futures contract for the same commodity these storage costs include the time value of money invested in the physical commodity plus the actual costs of storing the commodity less any benefits from ownership of the physical commodity that are not obtained by the holder of a futures contract this is sometimes referred to as the convenience yield to the extent that these storage costs change for a commodity while the investment fund has invested directly in that commodity the value of the investment funds investment in that commodity may change accordingly    in addition the values of commodities are subject to additional variables which may be less significant to the values of traditional securities such as stocks and bonds variables such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes and tariffs may have a larger impact on commodity prices these additional variables may create additional investment risks which subject the investment fund investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities energynatural resources investing the production and marketing of commodities energy and natural resources may be affected by actions and changes in governments securities of such companies may be subject to broad price fluctuations reflecting volatility of energy and basic materials prices and possible instability of supply of various hard assets as well as changes in demand due to international economic conditions in addition some such companies also may be subject to the risks of mining and oil drilling and the risks of other hazards such as fire drought and increased regulatory and environmental costs real estate investing in real estate including real estate investment trusts reits may subject an investment fund to risks associated with the ownership of real estate including terrorist attacks war or other acts that destroy real property in addition to securities market risks some reits may invest in a limited number of properties in a narrow geographic area or in a single property type which increases the risk that an investment fund could be unfavorably affected by the poor performance of a single investment or investment type these companies are also sensitive to factors such as changes in real estate values and property taxes interest rates cash flow of underlying real estate assets supply and demand and the management skill and creditworthiness of the issuer borrowers could default on or sell investments the reit holds which could reduce the cash flow needed to make distributions to investors in addition reits also may be affected by tax and regulatory requirements in that a reit may not qualify for preferential tax treatments or exemptions reits require specialized management and pay management expenses securities issued by private partnerships in real estate may be more illiquid than securities issued by other investment funds generally because the partnerships underlying real estate investments may tend to be less liquid than other types of investments nonus securities investment funds may invest in equity securities of nonus issuers and in depositary receipts such as american depositary receipts adrs that represent an indirect interest in securities of nonus issuers nonus securities in which investment funds invest may be listed on nonus securities exchanges or traded in nonus overthecounter markets or may be purchased in private placements and not be publicly traded investments in nonus securities are affected by risk factors generally not thought to be present in the us these factors are listed in the prospectus under types of investments and related risksinvestment related risksnonus investments as a general matter investment funds are not required to hedge against nonus currency risks including the risk of changing currency exchange rates which could reduce the value of nonus currency denominated portfolio securities irrespective of the underlying investment however from time to time an investment fund may enter into forward currency exchange contracts forward contracts for hedging purposes or nonhedging purposes to pursue its investment objective forward contracts are transactions involving the investment funds obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future    date at a specified price forward contracts may be used by the investment fund for hedging purposes to protect against uncertainty in the level of future nonus currency exchange rates such as when the investment fund anticipates purchasing or selling a nonus security this technique would allow the investment fund to lock in the us dollar price of the security forward contracts also may be used to attempt to protect the value of the investment funds existing holdings of nonus securities there may be however imperfect correlation between the investment funds nonus securities holdings and the forward contracts entered into with respect to such holdings forward contracts also may be used for nonhedging purposes to pursue the investment funds investment objective such as when an investment manager anticipates that particular nonus currencies will appreciate or depreciate in value even though securities denominated in such currencies are not then held in the investment funds investment portfolio money market instruments the fund and investment funds may invest for defensive purposes or otherwise some or all of their assets in high quality fixed income securities money market instruments and money market mutual funds or may hold cash or cash equivalents in such amounts as the adviser or investment managers deem appropriate under the circumstances the fund or investment funds also may invest in these instruments pending allocation of their respective offering proceeds money market instruments are high quality shortterm fixed income obligations which generally have remaining maturities of one year or less and may include us government securities commercial paper certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances issued by domestic branches of united states banks that are members of the federal deposit insurance corporation and repurchase agreements repurchase agreements the fund and the investment funds may enter into repurchase agreements to a limited extent repurchase agreements are agreements under which the fund or an investment fund purchases securities from a bank that is a member of the federal reserve system a foreign bank or a securities dealer that agrees to repurchase the securities from the fund or investment fund at a higher price on a designated future date if the seller under a repurchase agreement becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to repurchase the securities the fund or investment fund would have the right to sell the securities this right however may be restricted or the value of the securities may decline before the securities can be liquidated in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the securities before the repurchase of the securities under a repurchase agreement is accomplished the fund or investment fund might encounter a delay and incur costs including a decline in the value of the securities before being able to sell the securities repurchase agreements that are subject to foreign law may not enjoy protections comparable to those provided to certain repurchase agreements under us bankruptcy law and they therefore may involve greater risks the fund has adopted specific policies designed to minimize certain of the risks of loss from its use of repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements the fund and the investment funds may enter into reverse repurchase agreements to a limited extent reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of a security to a bank or securities dealer and the simultaneous agreement to repurchase the security for a fixed price reflecting a market rate of interest on a specific date these transactions involve a risk that the other party to a reverse repurchase agreement will be unable or unwilling to complete the transaction as scheduled which may result in losses to the fund or an investment fund reverse repurchase agreements are a form of leverage which also may increase the volatility of the funds or an investment funds investment portfolio the fund will segregate permissible liquid assets at least equal to the aggregate amount of its reverse repurchase obligations plus accrued interest    special investment techniques investment funds may use a variety of special investment techniques to hedge a portion of their investment portfolios against various risks or other factors that generally affect the values of securities they may also use these techniques for nonhedging purposes in pursuing their investment objectives these techniques may involve the use of derivative transactions the techniques investment funds may employ may change over time as new instruments and techniques are introduced or as a result of regulatory developments certain of the special investment techniques that investment funds may use are speculative and involve a high degree of risk particularly when used for nonhedging purposes it is possible that any hedging transaction may not perform as anticipated and that an investment fund may suffer losses as a result of its hedging activities derivatives investment funds may engage in transactions involving options futures forwards and other derivative financial instruments derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk depending upon the characteristics of the particular derivative and the portfolio as a whole derivatives permit investment funds to increase or decrease the level of risk or change the character of the risk to which their portfolios are exposed in much the same way as they can increase or decrease the level of risk or change the character of the risk of their portfolios by making investments in specific securities derivatives may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest meaning that a small investment in derivatives could have a large potential impact on an investment funds performance if an investment fund invests in derivatives at inopportune times or judges market conditions incorrectly such investments may lower the investment funds return or result in a loss an investment fund also could experience losses if its derivatives were poorly correlated with its other investments or if the investment fund were unable to liquidate its position because of an illiquid secondary market the market for many derivatives is or suddenly can become illiquid changes in liquidity may result in significant rapid and unpredictable changes in the prices for derivatives with respect to derivatives involving high yield and other debt securities an investment fund or the fund will usually have a contractual relationship only with the counterparty of the derivative and not with the issuer of the indebtedness an investment fund generally will have no right to directly enforce compliance by the issuer with the terms of a derivative nor any rights of setoff against the issuer nor have any voting rights with respect to the indebtedness an investment fund will not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the underlying indebtedness and will not have the benefit of the remedies that would normally be available to a holder of the indebtedness in addition in the event of the insolvency of the counterparty to the derivative the investment fund will be treated as a general creditor of such counterparty and will not have any claim with respect to the underlying indebtedness consequently the investment fund will be subject to the credit risk of the counterparty as well as that of the issuer of the indebtedness as a result concentrations of such derivatives in any one counterparty subject the investment fund andor the fund to an additional degree of risk with respect to defaults by such counterparty as well as by the issuer of the underlying indebtedness options and futures the investment funds may utilize options and futures contracts they also may use socalled synthetic options notional principal contracts with characteristics of an otc option or other derivative instruments written by brokerdealers or other permissible financial    intermediaries such transactions may be effected on securities exchanges in the overthecounter market or negotiated directly with counterparties when such transactions are purchased overthecounter or negotiated directly with counterparties an investment fund bears the risk that the counterparty will be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the option contract such transactions may also be illiquid and in such cases an investment fund may have difficulty closing out its position overthecounter options and synthetic transactions purchased and sold by investment funds may include options on baskets of specific securities the investment funds may purchase call and put options on specific securities and may write and sell covered or uncovered call and put options for hedging purposes and nonhedging purposes to pursue their investment objectives a put option gives the purchaser of the option the right to sell and obligates the writer to buy the underlying security at a stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the option similarly a call option gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and obligates the writer to sell the underlying security at a stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the option a covered call option is a call option with respect to which an investment fund owns the underlying security the sale of such an option exposes an investment fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or to possible continued holding of a security that might otherwise have been sold to protect against depreciation in the market price of the security a covered put option is a put option with respect to which cash or liquid securities have been placed in a segregated account on an investment funds books the sale of such an option exposes the seller during the term of the option to a decline in price of the underlying security while also depriving the seller of the opportunity to invest the segregated assets options sold by the investment funds need not be covered an investment fund may close out a position when writing options by purchasing an option on the same security with the same exercise price and expiration date as the option that it has previously written on the security the investment fund will realize a profit or loss if the amount paid to purchase an option is less or more as the case may be than the amount received from the sale thereof to close out a position as a purchaser of an option an investment manager would ordinarily effect a similar closing sale transaction which involves liquidating the position by selling the option previously purchased although the investment fund could exercise the option should it deem it advantageous to do so the adviser on behalf of the fund has claimed a temporary exemption from the definition of the term commodity pool operator cpo under the commodity exchange act cea therefore neither the fund nor the adviser with respect to the fund is currently subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool or cpo under the cea when the temporary exemption expires to the extent the fund is not otherwise eligible to claim an exclusion from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc the fund will operate subject to cftc regulation if the adviser and fund become subject to cftc regulation as well as related national futures association rules the fund may incur additional compliance and other expenses investment funds may enter into futures contracts in us domestic markets or on exchanges located outside the united states foreign markets may offer advantages such as trading opportunities or arbitrage possibilities not available in the united states foreign markets however may have greater risk potential than domestic markets for example some foreign exchanges are principal markets so that no common clearing facility exists and an investor may look only to the broker for performance of the contract in addition any profits that might be realized in trading could be eliminated by adverse changes in the exchange rate or a loss could be incurred as a result of those changes transactions on foreign exchanges may include both commodities which are traded on domestic exchanges and those which are not unlike trading on domestic commodity exchanges trading on foreign commodity exchanges is not regulated by the cftc    engaging in these transactions involves risk of loss which could adversely affect the value of the funds net assets no assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the trading day futures contract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially subjecting an investment fund to substantial losses successful use of futures also is subject to an investment managers ability to correctly predict movements in the direction of the relevant market and to the extent the transaction is entered into for hedging purposes to ascertain the appropriate correlation between the transaction being hedged and the price movements of the futures contract some or all of the investment managers may purchase and sell stock index futures contracts for an investment fund a stock index future obligates an investment fund to pay or receive an amount of cash equal to a fixed dollar amount specified in the futures contract multiplied by the difference between the settlement price of the contract on the contracts last trading day and the value of the index based on the stock prices of the securities that comprise it at the opening of trading in those securities on the next business day some or all of the investment managers may purchase and sell interest rate futures contracts for an investment fund an interest rate future represents an obligation to purchase or sell an amount of a specific debt security at a future date at a specific price some or all of the investment managers may purchase and sell currency futures or commodity futures a currency future creates an obligation to purchase or sell an amount of a specific currency at a future date at a specific price a commodity future creates an obligation to purchase or sell an amount of a specific commodity at a future date at a specific price options on securities indexes some or all of the investment managers may purchase and sell for the investment funds call and put options on stock indexes listed on national securities exchanges or traded in the overthecounter market for hedging purposes or nonhedging purposes to pursue their investment objectives a stock index fluctuates with changes in the market values of the stocks included in the index accordingly successful use by an investment manager of options on stock indexes will be subject to the investment managers ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the stock market generally or of a particular industry or market segment this requires different skills and techniques than predicting changes in the price of individual stocks warrants and rights warrants are derivative instruments that permit but do not obligate the holder to subscribe for other securities or commodities rights are similar to warrants but normally have a shorter duration and are offered or distributed to shareholders of a company warrants and rights do not carry with them the right to dividends or voting rights with respect to the securities that they entitle the holder to purchase and they do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer as a result warrants and rights may be considered more speculative than certain other types of equitylike securities in addition the values of warrants and rights do not necessarily change with the values of the underlying securities or commodities and these instruments cease to have value if they are not exercised prior to their expiration dates    swap agreements the investment managers may enter into equity interest rate and index and currency rate swap agreements on behalf of investment funds these transactions are entered into in an attempt to obtain a particular return when it is considered desirable to do so possibly at a lower cost than if an investment was made directly in the asset that yielded the desired return swap agreements are twoparty contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than a year in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or differentials in rates of return earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments which may be adjusted for an interest factor the gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount ie the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate in a particular foreign currency or in a basket of securities representing a particular index forms of swap agreements include interest rate caps under which in return for a premium one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates exceed a specified rate or cap interest rate floors under which in return for a premium one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates fall below a specified level or floor and interest rate collars under which a party sells a cap and purchases a floor or vice versa in an attempt to protect itself against interest rate movements exceeding given minimum or maximum levels most swap agreements entered into by an investment fund would require the calculation of the obligations of the parties to the agreements on a net basis consequently an investment funds current obligations or rights under a swap agreement generally will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement the net amount the risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited to the net amount of interest payments that a party is contractually obligated to make if the other party to a swap defaults an investment funds risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that it contractually is entitled to receive to achieve investment returns equivalent to those achieved by an investment manager in whose investment vehicles the fund could not invest directly perhaps because of their investment minimums or their unavailability for direct investment the fund may enter into swap agreements under which the fund may agree on a net basis to pay a return based on a floating interest rate such as libor and to receive the total return of the reference investment vehicle over a stated time period the fund may seek to achieve the same investment result through the use of other derivatives in similar circumstances the federal income tax treatment of swap agreements and other derivatives used in the above manner is unclear possible effects of speculative position limits the cftc and the us commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or short speculative futures positions that any person may hold or control in derivatives traded on us commodities exchanges all accounts owned or managed by a commodity trading adviser its principals and their affiliates generally will be combined for position limit purposes because futures position limits allow a commodity trading advisor its principals and their affiliates to control only a limited number of contracts in any one commodity each investment manager and its principals and affiliates are potentially subject to a conflict among the interests of all accounts the investment manager and its principals and their affiliates control which are competing for shares of that limited number of contracts although each investment manager may be able to achieve the same or similar performance results with otc substitutes for futures contracts the otc market may be subject to differing prices lesser liquidity and greater counterparty credit risks than on us commodities exchanges each investment manager may be required to reduce the size or number of positions that would otherwise be held for an investment fund or not trade in certain markets on behalf of the investment fund in order to avoid exceeding such limits modification of trades that would otherwise be made by an investment fund if required could adversely affect the investment funds operations and profitability a violation of speculative position limits by an investment manager could lead to regulatory action materially adverse to an investment funds prospects for profitability    the speculative position limits of the cftc and us commodities exchanges are subject to change any new or additional position limits imposed on an investment manager and its principal and affiliates may impact the investment funds ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective other instruments and future developments an investment fund may take advantage of opportunities in the area of swaps options on various underlying instruments and certain other customized synthetic or derivative instruments which will be subject to varying degrees of risk in addition an investment fund may take advantage of opportunities with respect to certain other synthetic or derivative instruments which are not presently contemplated or which are not presently available but which may be developed and which may be subject to significant degrees of risk hedging limitations although the adviser may seek one or more investment managers who employ various hedging techniques the extent and effectiveness of such hedging strategies may vary substantially moreover it will not be a goal of the adviser to retain investment managers who necessarily employ fully hedged or marketneutral strategies most hedging techniques of investment managers will be directed primarily toward general market risks or certain issuer risks typically there are numerous investment risks which will not be hedged or necessarily capable of being hedged as a practical matter to the extent unhedged investment positions of investment managers will in general be fully exposed to market and investment risks hedging techniques have a variety of limitations hedging against a decline in the value of a portfolio position by selling short for example does not eliminate fluctuations in the values of portfolio positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline but establishes other positions designed to gain from those same developments thus moderating the decline in the overall portfolio positions value hedging through market index options may only protect against an overall market downturn as compared with price declines in specific securities hedge transactions generally also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the portfolio position should increase due to the hedging cost or price decline in the hedging position for a variety of reasons an investment manager may not seek or be able to establish a sufficiently accurate correlation between hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged such imperfect correlation may prevent an investment fund from achieving the intended hedge or may expose the fund to risk of loss such losses can include losses on the hedged position the attempted hedge position or both and could be substantial there can be no assurance therefore that investment positions of investment funds will be significantly hedged against investment risks or that such hedging strategies if any will in fact prove successful tail risk hedging investment funds that pursue a tail risk hedging strategy invest in instruments designed to outperform during periods of market stress such periods may be characterized by among other factors i a significant decline in the equity markets ii a significant widening in credit spreads andor iii a significant increase in market volatility instruments designed to mitigate tail event risk involve a high degree of risk the type frequency and severity of tail events are difficult to predict or model and thus the expected return on an instrument designed to appreciate on the occurrence of any such tail event is difficult to calculate with respect to tail event instruments it is necessary for investment managers to rely on information provided by a counterparty or independent source such as an index that may not be accurate and the investment manager may not be able to verify or challenge the information securities that are linked to tail events may in the future have novel features or nonstandardized terms an investment fund risks the loss of all or a portion of principal andor interest due on the tail eventlinked securities it may purchase if a period of severe market stress fails to occur during    the term of such securities modeldriven strategies such as a tail risk hedging strategy may not achieve their intended results whether due to unusual or changing market conditions or relationships and may also involve frequent trading and transaction expenses lending portfolio securities an investment fund may lend securities from its portfolio to brokers dealers and other financial institutions needing to borrow securities to complete certain transactions the investment fund continues to be entitled to payments in amounts equal to the interest dividends or other distributions payable on the loaned securities which affords the investment fund an opportunity to earn interest on the amount of the loan and on the loaned securities collateral an investment fund generally will receive collateral consisting of cash us government securities or irrevocable letters of credit which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least  of the current market value of the loaned securities the investment fund might experience risk of loss if the institution with which it has engaged in a portfolio loan transaction breaches its agreement with the investment fund whenissued delayed delivery and forward commitment securities to reduce the risk of changes in securities prices and interest rates an investment fund may purchase securities on a forward commitment whenissued or delayed delivery basis which means delivery and payment take place a number of days after the date of the commitment to purchase the payment obligation and the interest rate receivable with respect to such purchases are fixed when the investment fund enters into the commitment but the investment fund does not make payment until it receives delivery from the counterparty after an investment fund commits to purchase such securities but before delivery and settlement it may sell the securities if it is deemed advisable securities purchased on a forward commitment whenissued or delayed delivery basis are subject to changes in value generally changing in the same way ie appreciating when interest rates decline and depreciating when interest rates rise based upon the publics perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and changes real or anticipated in the level of interest rates securities so purchased may expose an investment fund to risks because they may experience such fluctuations prior to their actual delivery purchasing securities on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis can involve the additional risk that the yield available in the market when the delivery takes place actually may be higher than that obtained in the transaction itself purchasing securities on a forward commitment whenissued or delayed delivery basis when an investment fund is fully or almost fully invested results in a form of leverage and may result in greater potential fluctuation in the value of the net assets of an investment fund in addition there is a risk that securities purchased on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis may not be delivered and that the purchaser of securities sold by an investment fund on a forward basis will not honor its purchase obligation in such cases the investment fund may incur a loss risk management the sophistication of the risk management techniques employed by investment managers varies however even the most sophisticated risk management techniques cannot protect an investment fund against loss in all circumstances all risk management models are premised upon assumptions with respect to economic and political conditions market sentiment and other factors the occurrence of an aberrational event not anticipated by a model can cause a portfolio to sustain a significant loss such events may include volatility in energy prices sharp swings in interest rates or other factors    repurchases and transfers of shares repurchase offers as discussed in the prospectus offers to repurchase shares will be made by the fund at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the funds board of trustees the board in its sole discretion in accordance with the provisions of applicable law in determining whether the fund

proxy voting record while it is unlikely that the fund will hold voting securities on a regular basis pursuant to its stated investment policies the fund may from time to time hold voting securities in an investment fund and may at some point vote a proxy the board of trustees of the fund believes that the voting of proxies on securities held by the fund is an important element of the overall investment process as such the board has delegated the responsibility to vote such proxies to the adviser the following is a summary of the advisers proxy voting policy proxy policy the adviser uses its best efforts to vote proxies on securities held in the fund as part of its authority to manage acquire and dispose of fund assets in this regard the adviser has formed a proxy review committee committee comprised of senior investment professionals that is responsible for creating and implementing the proxy policy the committee meets monthly but may meet more frequently as conditions warrant the proxy policy provides that the adviser will vote proxies in the best interests of clients consistent with the objective of maximizing long term investment returns the proxy policy provides that the adviser will generally vote proxies in accordance with predetermined guidelines contained in the proxy policy the adviser may vote in a manner that is not consistent with the predetermined guidelines provided that the vote is approved by the committee the adviser will generally not vote a proxy if it has sold the affected security between the record date and the meeting date the proxy policy provides that unless otherwise determined by the committee votes will be cast in the manner described below        generally routine proposals will be voted in support of management         with regard to the election of directors where no conflict exists and where no specific governance deficiency has been noted votes will be cast in support of managements nominees        the adviser will vote in accordance with managements recommendation with respect to certain nonroutine proposals ie reasonable capitalization changes stock repurchase programs stock splits certain compensationrelated matters certain antitakeover measures etc        the adviser will vote against certain nonroutine proposals ie unreasonable capitalization changes establishment of cumulative voting rights for the election of directors requiring supermajority shareholder votes to amend bylaws indemnification of auditors etc        the adviser will vote in its discretion with respect to certain nonroutine proposals ie mergers acquisitions takeovers spinoffs etc which may have a substantive financial or best interest impact on an issuer        the adviser will vote for certain proposals it believes call for reasonable charter provisions or corporate governance practices ie requiring auditors to attend annual shareholder meetings requiring that members of compensation nominating and audit committees be independent reducing or eliminating supermajority voting requirements etc        the adviser will vote against certain proposals it believes call for unreasonable charter provisions or corporate governance practices ie proposals to declassify boards proposals to require a company to prepare reports that are costly to provide or that would require duplicative efforts or expenditure that are of a nonbusiness nature or would provide no pertinent information from the perspective of institutional shareholders etc        certain other proposals ie proposals requiring directors to own large amounts of company stock to be eligible for election requiring diversity of board membership relating to broad based social religious or ethnic groups limiting retirement benefits or executive compensation etc generally are evaluated by the committee based on the nature of the proposal and the likely impact on shareholders conflicts of interest if the committee determines that an issue raises a material conflict of interest or gives rise to a potential material conflict of interest the committee will request a special committee to review and recommend a course of action with respect to the conflict in question and the committee will have sole discretion to cast a vote third parties to assist in its responsibility for voting proxies the adviser may from time to time retain experts in the proxy voting and corporate governance area as proxy research providers research providers the services provided to the adviser by the research providers would include in depth research global issuer analysis and voting recommendations while the adviser may review and utilize recommendations made by the research providers in making proxy voting decisions it is in no way obligated to follow any such recommendations in addition to research the research providers could provide vote execution reporting and recordkeeping the committee would carefully monitor and supervise the services provided by any research providers    further information a copy of the proxy policy is available on our web site at                      and on the secs web site at wwwsecgov conflicts of interest the adviser and the investment managers the adviser and its affiliates manage other accounts including other funds and accounts in which the investment managers may have an interest other than the fund adviser accounts set out below are practices that the adviser may follow many of the investment managers and their respective affiliates also manage other accounts other than the investment funds although the adviser anticipates that investment managers will follow practices similar to those described below no guarantee or assurances can be made that similar practices will be followed or that an investment manager will adhere to and comply with its stated practices participation in investment opportunities the adviser expects to employ an investment program for the fund that is substantially similar to the investment program or in some cases to portions of the investment program employed by it for certain adviser accounts as a general matter the adviser will consider participation by the fund in all appropriate investment opportunities that are under consideration for those adviser accounts there may be circumstances however under which the adviser will cause one or more adviser accounts to commit a larger percentage of their respective assets to an investment opportunity than that to which the adviser will commit the funds assets there also may be circumstances under which the adviser will consider participation by adviser accounts in investment opportunities in which the adviser does not intend to invest on behalf of the fund or vice versa the adviser evaluates for the fund and for the adviser accounts a variety of factors that may be relevant in determining whether a particular investment opportunity or strategy is appropriate and feasible for the fund or an adviser account at a particular time including but not limited to the following  the nature of the investment opportunity taken in the context of the other investments at the time  the liquidity of the investment relative to the needs of the particular entity or account  the availability of the opportunity ie size of obtainable position  the transaction costs involved and  the investment or regulatory limitations applicable to the particular entity or account because these considerations may differ for the fund and the adviser accounts in the context of any particular investment opportunity the investment activities of the fund and the adviser accounts may differ from time to time in addition the fees and expenses of the fund differ from those of the adviser accounts accordingly the future performance of the fund and the adviser accounts will vary when the adviser determines that it would be appropriate for the fund and one or more adviser accounts to participate in an investment transaction in the same investment fund or other investment at the same time it will attempt to aggregate place and allocate orders on a basis that the adviser believes to be fair and equitable consistent with its responsibilities under applicable law decisions in this regard are necessarily subjective and there is no requirement that the fund participate or participate to the same extent as the adviser accounts in all investments or trades however no participating entity or account will receive preferential treatment over any other and the adviser will take steps to ensure that no participating entity or account will be systematically disadvantaged by the aggregation placement and allocation of orders and investments    situations may occur however where the fund could be disadvantaged because of the investment activities conducted by the adviser for the adviser accounts such situations may be based on among other things the following  legal restrictions or other limitations including limitations imposed by investment managers with respect to investment funds on the combined size of positions that may be taken for the fund andor the adviser accounts thereby limiting the size of the funds position or the availability of the investment opportunity  the difficulty of liquidating an investment for the fund and the adviser accounts where the market cannot absorb the sale of the combined positions and  the determination that a particular investment is warranted only if hedged with an option or other instrument and there is a limited availability of such options or other instruments in particular the fund may be legally restricted from entering into a joint transaction as defined in the  act with the adviser accounts with respect to the securities of an issuer without first obtaining exemptive relief from the sec see other matters below directors principals officers employees and affiliates of the adviser and each investment manager may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with respect to

time to time provide investment advisory or other services to private investment funds and other entities or accounts managed by the adviser or its affiliates other matters an investment manager may from time to time cause an investment fund to effect certain principal transactions in securities with one or more investment manager accounts subject to certain conditions for example these transactions may be made in circumstances in which the investment manager determined it was appropriate for the investment fund to purchase and an investment manager account to sell or the investment fund to sell and an investment manager account to purchase the same security or instrument on the same day future investment activities of the investment managers or their affiliates and the

affiliates and their principals partners directors officers or employees may give rise to conflicts of interest other than those described above    tax considerations the following is a summary of certain us federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition holding and disposition of shares by us shareholders this summary is based upon existing us federal income tax law which is subject to change possibly with retroactive effect this summary does not discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation which may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstance including investors subject to special tax rules such as us financial institutions insurance companies brokerdealers taxexempt organizations partnerships shareholders who are not united states persons as defined in the code shareholders liable for the alternative minimum tax persons holding shares through partnerships or other passthrough entities or investors that have a functional currency other than the us dollar all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below this summary assumes that investors have acquired shares pursuant to this offering and will hold their shares as capital assets generally property held for investment for us federal income tax purposes prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the nonus and us federal state and local income and other tax considerations that may be relevant to an investment in the fund in addition to the particular matters set forth in this section taxexempt entities should review carefully those sections of this sai regarding liquidity and other financial matters to ascertain whether the investment objectives of the fund are consistent with their overall investment plans taxation of the fund the fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company a ric under federal income tax law if the fund so qualifies and distributes each year to its shareholders at least  of its investment company taxable income the fund will not be required to pay federal income taxes on any income it distributes to shareholders if the fund distributes less than an amount equal to the sum of  of its ordinary income and  of its capital gain net income plus any amounts that were not distributed in previous taxable years then the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the undistributed amounts the fund is required to use the accrual method of accounting and expects to use the calendar year as its tax year for income tax purposes as described below under investments in passive foreign investment companies the fund expects to be taxed at ordinary income rates on gains from the investment funds distributions to shareholders shareholders normally will be subject to us federal income taxes and any state andor local income taxes on the dividends and other distributions that they receive from the fund as described below under investments in passive foreign investment companies the fund expects that distributions of both income derived from the investment funds as well as gains from the disposition of the investment funds will be taxable to shareholders at ordinary income rates to the extent of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits such distributions will generally be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income regardless of whether shareholders receive such payments in cash or reinvest the distributions in the fund distributions by the fund in excess of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a taxfree return of capital to the extent of and in reduction of the shareholders tax bases in their shares and any such amount in excess of their bases will be treated as gain from the sale of shares as discussed below    if the fund receives distributions of qualified dividend income from the investment funds it could potentially make distributions to shareholders that are taxed at the same rates as longterm capital gains the fund does not expect that it will make distributions to shareholders that are eligible for this reduced rate of taxation shareholders are generally taxed on any ordinary income dividend or capital gain distributions from the fund in the year they are actually distributed however if any such dividends or distributions are declared in october november or december and paid to shareholders of record of such month in january of the following year then such amounts will be treated for tax purposes as having been distributed by the fund and received by the shareholders on december  of the year prior to the date of payment if the fund receives qualifying dividends from its investments it could potentially make distributions that are eligible for the  dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders the fund does not expect that it will make distributions to shareholders that are eligible for this deduction the fund intends to distribute its ordinary income and capital gains at least once annually the fund will inform shareholders of the source and status of each distribution made in a given calendar year promptly after the close of such calendar year shareholders who are not citizens or residents of the united states generally will be subject to a  us federal withholding tax or us federal withholding tax at such lower rate as prescribed by applicable treaty on distributions of the funds income derived from the investment funds each nonus shareholder must provide documentation to the fund certifying its nonus status income from repurchases and transfers of shares the repurchase or transfer of the funds shares may result in a taxable gain or loss to the tendering shareholder different tax consequences may apply for tendering and nontendering shareholders in connection with a repurchase offer for example if a shareholder does not tender all of his or her shares such repurchase may not be treated as an exchange for us federal income tax purposes and may result in deemed distributions to nontendering shareholders on the other hand shareholders who tender all of their shares including shares deemed owned by shareholders under constructive ownership rules will be treated as having sold their shares and generally will realize a capital gain or loss such gain or loss is measured by the difference between the shareholders amount received and his or her adjusted tax basis of the shares for noncorporate shareholders gain or loss from the transfer or repurchase of shares generally will be taxable at a us federal income tax rate dependent upon the length of time the shares were held shares held for a period of one year or less at the time of such repurchase or transfer will for us federal income tax purposes generally result in shortterm capital gains or losses and those held for more than one year will generally result in longterm capital gains or losses investments in passive foreign investment companies the fund intends to purchase interests in investment funds organized outside the united states that are treated as corporations for us tax purposes and that will generally be treated as passive foreign investment companies pfics the fund intends to elect to marktomarket all shares that it holds in pfics at the end of each taxable year by making this election the fund will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares as of the close of the taxable year over their adjusted basis and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value unless the loss is required to be deferred gains realized with respect to pfics that the fund has elected to marktomarket will be ordinary income if the fund    realizes a loss with respect to such a pfic whether by virtue of selling the pfic or because of the marktomarket adjustment described above such loss will be ordinary to the extent of the excess of the sum of the marktomarket gains over the marktomarket losses recognized with respect to the pfic to the extent that the funds loss with respect to the pfic exceeds such limitation the loss will generally be deferred until sold at which point the loss will be treated as a capital loss although the fund may only deduct capital losses in a given taxable year to the extent of capital gains the fund may carry forward remaining capital losses for up to  years following the taxable year in which the loss was recognized however the fund does not expect to generate significant capital gains from its investments by making the marktomarket election the fund may be required to recognize income which generally must be distributed to shareholders in excess of the distributions that it received from pfics accordingly the fund may need to borrow money or dispose of its interests in the investment funds in order to make the required distributions if the fund does not make the marktomarket election or treat the pfic as a qualified electing fund qef it would be subject to an interest charge at the rate applicable to tax underpayments on tax liability treated as having been deferred with respect to certain distributions and on gain from the disposition of the shares of a pfic collectively referred to as excess distributions even if such excess distributions are paid by the fund as a dividend to its shareholders fund tax returns and tax information the fund is required to use the accrual method of accounting and expects to use the calendar year as its tax year for income tax purposes after the end of each calendar year shareholders will be sent information regarding the amount and character of distributions received from the fund during the year state and local taxes in addition to the us federal income tax consequences summarized above prospective investors should consider the potential state and local tax consequences of an investment in the fund the fund may become subject to income and other taxes in states and localities based on the funds investments in entities that conduct business in those jurisdictions shareholders are generally taxable in their state of residence on their share of the funds income shareholders may be subject to tax in other jurisdictions depending on the activities of the investment funds in which the fund invests and the laws of those jurisdictions additionally shareholders may be entitled to a credit in their state of residence for taxes paid to other jurisdictions information reporting and backup withholding information returns generally will be filed with the internal revenue service in connection with distributions with respect to the shares unless shareholders establish that they are exempt from the information reporting rules for example by properly establishing that they are corporations if shareholders do not establish that they are exempt from these rules they generally will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if they fail to provide their taxpayer identification number or otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to shareholders will be allowed as a credit against their us federal income tax liability and may entitle shareholders to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the irs    other taxes the foregoing is a summary of some of the tax rules and considerations affecting shareholders and the funds operations and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all relevant tax rules and considerations nor does it purport to be a complete listing of all potential tax risks inherent in making an investment in the fund nonus investors are urged to consult with their own tax advisers regarding any proposed investment in the fund a shareholder may be subject to other taxes including but not limited to state and local taxes estate and inheritance taxes and intangible taxes that may be imposed by various jurisdictions the fund also may be subject to state local and foreign taxes that could reduce cash distributions to shareholders it is the responsibility of each shareholder to file all appropriate tax returns that may be required each prospective shareholder is urged to consult with his or her tax adviser with respect to any investment in the fund erisa and certain other considerations persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an employee benefit plan or other arrangement subject to erisa an erisa plan and persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an ira or keogh plan which is not subject to erisa but is subject to the prohibited transaction rules of section  of the code together with erisa plans benefit plans should consider among other things the matters described below before determining whether to invest in the fund erisa imposes certain general and specific responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an erisa plan including prudence diversification an obligation not to engage in a prohibited transaction and other standards in determining whether a particular investment is appropriate for an erisa plan regulations of the us department of labor the dol provide that a fiduciary of an erisa plan must give appropriate consideration to among other things the role that the investment plays in the erisa plans portfolio taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the erisa plans purposes an examination of the risk and return factors the portfolios composition with regard to diversification the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the erisa plan the income tax consequences of the investment see tax aspects and the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the erisa plans funding objectives before investing the assets of an erisa plan in the fund a fiduciary should determine whether such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the foregoing regulations for example a fiduciary should consider whether an investment in the fund may be too illiquid or too speculative for a particular erisa plan and whether the assets of the erisa plan would be sufficiently diversified if a fiduciary with respect to any such erisa plan breaches its or his responsibilities with regard to selecting an investment or an investment course of action for such erisa plan the fiduciary itself or himself may be held liable for losses incurred by the erisa plan as a result of such breach because the fund is registered as an investment company under the  act the fund will be proceeding on the basis that its underlying assets should not be considered to be plan assets of the erisa plans investing in the fund for purposes of erisas or the codes fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules a benefit plan which proposes to invest in the fund will be required to represent that it and any fiduciaries responsible for such plans investments are aware of and understand the funds investment objective policies and strategies that the decision to invest plan assets in the fund was made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment factors with regard to the benefit plan and is consistent with the duties and responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries with regard to their investment decisions under erisa and the code as applicable    certain prospective benefit plan shareholders may currently maintain relationships with the adviser or its affiliates each of such persons may be deemed to be a fiduciary of or other party in interest or disqualified person of any benefit plan to which it provides investment management investment advisory or other services erisa prohibits and the code penalizes the use of erisa plan and benefit plan assets for the benefit of a party in interest and also prohibits or penalizes an erisa plan or benefit plan fiduciary from using its position to cause such plan to make an investment from which it or certain third parties in which such fiduciary has an interest would receive a fee or other consideration benefit plan shareholders should consult with their own counsel and other advisors to determine if participation in the fund is a transaction that is prohibited by erisa or the code or is otherwise inappropriate fiduciaries of erisa or benefit plan shareholders will be required to represent that the decision to invest in the fund was made by them as fiduciaries that are independent of such affiliated persons that such fiduciaries are duly authorized to make such investment decision and that they have not relied on any individualized advice or recommendation of such affiliated persons as a primary basis for the decision to invest in the fund employee benefit plans which are not subject to erisa may be subject to other rules governing such plans fiduciaries of nonerisa plans whether or not subject to section  of the code should consult with their own counsel and other advisors regarding such matters the provisions of erisa and the code are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review the discussion of erisa and the code contained in this sai and the prospectus is general and may be affected by future publication of regulations and rulings potential benefit plan shareholders should consult their legal advisers regarding the consequences under erisa and the code of the acquisition and ownership of shares brokerage each investment manager is responsible for placing orders for the execution of portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage for any investment fund it manages transactions on us stock exchanges and on some nonus stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions on the great majority of nonus stock exchanges commissions are fixed no stated commission is generally applicable to securities traded in overthecounter markets but the prices of those securities include undisclosed commissions or markups the adviser expects that each investment manager will generally select brokers and dealers to effect transactions on behalf of its investment fund substantially as described below although the adviser can give no assurance that an investment manager will adhere to and comply with the described practices the adviser generally expects that in selecting brokers and dealers to effect transactions on behalf of an investment fund an investment manager will seek to obtain the best price and execution for the transactions taking into account factors such as price size of order difficulty of execution and operational facilities of a brokerage firm and the firms risk in positioning a block of securities subject to appropriate disclosure however investment managers of investment funds that are not investment companies registered under the  act may select brokers on a basis other than that outlined above and may receive benefits other than research or that benefit the investment manager rather than its investment fund the adviser may consider the broker selection process employed by an investment manager as a factor in determining whether to invest in its investment fund each investment manager generally will seek reasonably competitive commission rates but will not necessarily pay the lowest commission available on each transaction    consistent with seeking best price and execution an investment manager may place brokerage orders with brokers that may provide the investment manager and its affiliates with supplemental research market and statistical information including advice as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or of purchasers or sellers of securities and furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts the expenses of an investment manager are not necessarily reduced as a result of the receipt of this supplemental information which may be useful to the investment manager or its affiliates in providing services to clients other than an investment fund in addition not all of the supplemental information is used by the investment manager in connection with an investment fund in which the fund invests conversely the information provided to the investment manager by brokers and dealers through which other clients of the investment manager and its affiliates effect securities transactions may be useful to the investment manager in providing services to an investment fund administrator the fund has retained the administrator                      whose principal business address is                      to provide

procedures to be provided   a annex b description of ratings moodys investors service inc    longterm obligation ratings moodys longterm obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of fixedincome obligations with an original maturity of one year or more they address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as promised such ratings reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of default aaa obligations rated aaa are judged to be of the highest quality with minimal credit risk aa obligations rated aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk a obligations rated a are considered uppermedium grade and are subject to low credit risk baa obligations rated baa are subject to moderate credit risk they are considered mediumgrade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics ba obligations rated ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk b obligations rated b are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk caa obligations rated caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk ca obligations rated ca are highly speculative and are likely in or very near default with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest c obligations rated c are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in default with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest moodys appends numerical modifiers   and  to each generic rating classification from aa through caa the modifier  indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category    shortterm ratings moodys shortterm ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor shortterm financial obligations ratings may be assigned to issuers shortterm programs or to individual shortterm debt instruments such obligations generally have an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months unless explicitly noted moodys employs the following designations to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers p issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have a superior ability to repay shortterm debt obligations p issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have a strong ability to repay shortterm debt obligations p issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have an acceptable ability to repay shortterm obligations np issuers or supporting institutions rated not prime do not fall within any of the prime rating categories canadian issuers rated p or p have their shortterm ratings enhanced by the seniormost longterm rating of the issuer its guarantor or supportprovider    us municipal shortterm debt ratings there are three rating categories for shortterm municipal obligations that are considered investment grade these ratings are designated as municipal investment grade mig and are divided into three levelsmig  through mig  in addition those shortterm obligations that are of speculative quality are designated sg or speculative grade mig ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation mig  this designation denotes superior credit quality excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows highly reliable liquidity support or demonstrated broadbased access to the market for refinancing mig  this designation denotes strong credit quality margins of protection are ample although not as large as in the preceding group mig  this designation denotes acceptable credit quality liquidity and cashflow protection may be narrow and market access for refinancing is likely to be less wellestablished sg this designation denotes speculativegrade credit quality debt instruments in this category may lack sufficient margins of protection    demand obligation ratings in the case of variable rate demand obligations vrdos a twocomponent rating is assigned a long or shortterm debt rating and a demand obligation rating the first element represents moodys evaluation of the degree of risk associated with scheduled principal and interest payments the second element represents moodys evaluation of the degree of risk associated with the ability to receive purchase price upon demand demand feature using a variation of the mig rating scale the variable municipal investment grade or vmig rating when either the long or shortterm aspect of a vrdo is not rated that piece is designated nr eg aaanr or nrvmig  vmig rating expirations are a function of each issues specific structural or credit features vmig  this designation denotes superior credit quality excellent protection is afforded by the superior shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand vmig  this designation denotes strong credit quality good protection is afforded by the strong shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand vmig  this designation denotes acceptable credit quality adequate protection is afforded by the satisfactory shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand sg this designation denotes speculativegrade credit quality demand features rated in this category may be supported by a liquidity provider that does not have an investment grade shortterm rating or may lack the structural andor legal protections necessary to ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand standard  poors ratings services    longterm issue credit ratings issue credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation nature of and provisions of the obligation protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights issue ratings are an assessment of default risk but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations aaa an obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa an obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only to a small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong a an obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbb an obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb an obligation rated bb is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligors capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ccc an obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cc an obligation rated cc is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment c a c rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms of the documents or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment default among others the c rating may be assigned to subordinated debt preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the instruments terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par d an obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poors believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized an obligations rating is lowered to d upon completion of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus  or minus  sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories nr this indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poors does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy    shortterm issue credit ratings a a shortterm obligation rated a is rated in the highest category by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong within this category certain obligations are designated with a plus sign  this indicates that the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong a a shortterm obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory a a shortterm obligation rated a exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b a shortterm obligation rated b is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics ratings of b b and b may be assigned to indicate finer distinctions within the b category the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation however it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b a shortterm obligation rated b is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics but the obligor has a relatively stronger capacity to meet its financial commitments over the shortterm compared to other speculativegrade obligors b a shortterm obligation rated b is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics and the obligor has an average speculativegrade capacity to meet its financial commitments over the shortterm compared to other speculativegrade obligors b a shortterm obligation rated b is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics and the obligor has a relatively weaker capacity to meet its financial commitments over the shortterm compared to other speculativegrade obligors c a shortterm obligation rated c is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation d a shortterm obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poors believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized dual ratings standard  poors assigns dual ratings to all debt issues that have a put option or demand feature as part of their structure the first rating addresses the likelihood of repayment of principal and interest as due and the second rating addresses only the demand feature the longterm rating symbols are used for bonds to denote the longterm maturity and the shortterm rating symbols for the put option for example aaaa with us municipal shortterm demand debt note rating symbols are used with the shortterm issue credit rating symbols for example spa    active qualifiers currently applied andor outstanding i this subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors terms or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of interest are different from the credit factors terms or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of principal on the obligation the i subscript indicates that the rating addresses the interest portion of the obligation only the i subscript will always be used in conjunction with the p subscript which addresses likelihood of receipt of principal for example a rated obligation could be assigned ratings of aaap nri indicating that the principal portion is rated aaa and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated l ratings qualified with l apply only to amounts invested up to federal deposit insurance limits p this subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors the terms or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of principal are different from the credit factors terms or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of interest on the obligation the p subscript indicates that the rating addresses the principal portion of the obligation only the p subscript will always be used in conjunction with the i subscript which addresses likelihood of receipt of interest for example a rated obligation could be assigned ratings of aaap nri indicating that the principal portion is rated aaa and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated pi ratings with a pi subscript are based on an analysis of an issuers published financial information as well as additional information in the public domain they do not however reflect indepth meetings with an issuers management and therefore may be based on less comprehensive information than ratings without a pi subscript ratings with a pi subscript are reviewed annually based on a new years financial statements but may be reviewed on an interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect the issuers credit quality preliminary preliminary ratings with the prelim qualifier may be assigned to obligors or obligations including financial programs in the circumstances described below assignment of a final rating is conditional on the receipt by standard  poors of appropriate documentation standard  poors reserves the right not to issue a final rating moreover if a final rating is issued it may differ from the preliminary rating        preliminary ratings may be assigned to obligations most commonly structured and project finance issues pending receipt of final documentation and legal opinions        preliminary ratings are assigned to rule  shelf registrations as specific issues with defined terms are offered from the master registration a final rating may be assigned to them in accordance with standard  poors policies        preliminary ratings may be assigned to obligations that will likely be issued upon the obligors emergence from bankruptcy or similar reorganization based on latestage reorganization plans documentation and discussions with the obligor preliminary ratings may also be assigned to the obligors these ratings consider the anticipated general credit quality of the reorganized or post bankruptcy issuer as well as attributes of the anticipated obligations        preliminary ratings may be assigned to entities that are being formed or that are in the process of being independently established when in standard  poors opinion documentation is close to final preliminary ratings may also be assigned to these entities obligations        preliminary ratings may be assigned when a previously unrated entity is undergoing a wellformulated restructuring recapitalization significant financing or other transformative event generally at the point that investor or lender commitments are invited the preliminary rating may be assigned to the entity and to its proposed obligations these preliminary ratings consider the anticipated general credit quality of the obligor as well as attributes of the anticipated obligations assuming successful completion of the transformative event should the transformative event not occur standard  poors would likely withdraw these preliminary ratings        a preliminary recovery rating may be assigned to an obligation that has a preliminary issue credit rating sf this qualifier is assigned to all issues and issuers to which a regulation such as the european union regulation on credit rating agencies requires the assignment of an additional symbol which distinguishes a structured finance instrument or obligor as defined in the regulation from any other instrument or obligor the addition of this subscript to a credit rating does not change the definition of that rating or our opinion about the issues or issuers creditworthiness t this symbol indicates termination structures that are designed to honor their contracts to full maturity or should certain events occur to terminate and cash settle all their contracts before their final maturity date unsolicited unsolicited ratings are those credit ratings assigned at the initiative of standard  poors and not at the request of the issuer or its agents  inactive qualifiers no longer applied or outstanding  this symbol indicated continuance of the ratings is contingent upon standard  poors receipt of an executed copy of the escrow agreement or closing documentation confirming investments and cash flows discontinued use in august  c this qualifier was used to provide additional information to investors that the bank may terminate its obligation to purchase tendered bonds if the longterm credit rating of the issuer is below an investmentgrade level andor the issuers bonds are deemed taxable discontinued use in january  pr the letters pr indicated that the rating was provisional a provisional rating assumed the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicated that payment of debt service requirements was largely or entirely dependent upon the successful timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project made no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion q a q subscript indicated that the rating was based solely on quantitative analysis of publicly available information discontinued use in april  r the r modifier was assigned to securities containing extraordinary risks particularly market risks that are not covered in the credit rating the absence of an r modifier should not be taken as an indication that an obligation will not exhibit extraordinary noncredit related risks standard  poors discontinued the use of the r modifier for most obligations in june  and for the balance of obligations mainly structured finance transactions in november  local currency and foreign currency risks country risk considerations are a standard part of standard  poors analysis for credit ratings on any issuer or issue currency of repayment is a key factor in this analysis an obligors capacity to repay foreign currency obligations may be lower than its capacity to repay obligations in its local currency due to the sovereign governments own relatively lower capacity to repay external versus domestic debt these sovereign risk considerations are incorporated in the debt ratings assigned to specific issues foreign currency issuer ratings are also distinguished from local currency issuer ratings to identify those instances where sovereign risks make them different for the same issuer fitch inc    longterm ratings scales aaa highest credit quality aaa ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk they are assigned only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments this capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events aa very high credit quality aa ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk they indicate very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments this capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events a high credit quality a ratings denote expectations of low credit risk the capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong this capacity may nevertheless be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings bbb good credit quality bbb ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low the capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity bb speculative bb ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time however business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met b highly speculative b ratings indicate that material credit risk is present ccc substantial credit risk ccc ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present cc very high levels of credit risk cc ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk c exceptionally high levels of credit risk default is imminent or inevitable or the issuer is in standstill conditions that are indicative of a c category rating for an issuer include        the issuer has entered into a grace or cure period following nonpayment of a material financial obligation        the issuer has entered into a temporary negotiated waiver or standstill agreement following a payment default on a material financial obligation or        fitch ratings otherwise believes a condition of rd or d to be imminent or inevitable including through the formal announcement of a distressed debt exchange rd restricted default rd ratings indicate an issuer that in fitch ratings opinion has experienced an uncured payment default on a bond loan or other material financial obligation but which has not entered into bankruptcy filings administration receivership liquidation or other formal windingup procedure and which has not otherwise ceased operating this would include        the selective payment default on a specific class or currency of debt        the uncured expiry of any applicable grace period cure period or default forbearance period following a payment default on a bank loan capital markets security or other material financial obligation        the extension of multiple waivers or forbearance periods upon a payment default on one or more material financial obligations either in series or in parallel or        execution of a distressed debt exchange on one or more material financial obligations d default d ratings indicate an issuer that in fitch ratings opinion has entered into bankruptcy filings administration receivership liquidation or other formal windingup procedure or which has otherwise ceased business default ratings are not assigned prospectively to entities or their obligations within this context nonpayment on an instrument that contains a deferral feature or grace period will generally not be considered a default until after the expiration of the deferral or grace period unless a default is otherwise driven by bankruptcy or other similar circumstance or by a distressed debt exchange imminent default typically refers to the occasion where a payment default has been intimated by the issuer and is all but inevitable this may for example be where an issuer has missed a scheduled payment but as is typical has a grace period during which it may cure the payment default another alternative would be where an issuer has formally announced a distressed debt exchange but the date of the exchange still lies several days or weeks in the immediate future in all cases the assignment of a default rating reflects the agencys opinion as to the most appropriate rating category consistent with the rest of its universe of ratings and may differ from the definition of default under the terms of an issuers financial obligations or local commercial practice the modifiers  or  may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories such suffixes are not added to the aaa longterm category or to longterm categories below b    shortterm credit ratings a shortterm issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the shortterm vulnerability to default of the rated entity or security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the relevant obligation shortterm ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as short term based on market convention typically this means up to  months for corporate structured and sovereign obligations and up to  months for obligations in us public finance markets f highest shortterm credit quality indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments may have an added  to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature f good shortterm credit quality good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments f fair shortterm credit quality the intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate b speculative shortterm credit quality minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments plus heightened vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions c high shortterm default risk default is a real possibility rd restricted default indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments although it continues to meet other financial obligations applicable to entity ratings only d default indicates a broadbased default event for an entity or the default of a specific shortterm obligation    recovery ratings recovery ratings are assigned to selected individual securities and obligations these currently are published for most individual obligations of corporate issuers with ratings in the b rating category and below among the factors that affect recovery rates for securities are the collateral the seniority relative to other obligations in the capital structure where appropriate and the expected value of the company or underlying collateral in distress the recovery rating scale is based upon the expected relative recovery characteristics of an obligation upon the curing of a default emergence from insolvency or following the liquidation or termination of the obligor or its associated collateral for structured finance recovery ratings are designed to estimate recoveries on a forwardlooking basis while taking into account the time value of money recovery ratings are an ordinal scale and do not attempt to precisely predict a given level of recovery as a guideline in developing the rating assessments the agency employs broad theoretical recovery bands in its ratings approach based on historical averages but actual recoveries for a given security may deviate materially from historical averages rr outstanding recovery prospects given default rr rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering  of current principal and related interest rr superior recovery prospects given default rr rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering  of current principal and
