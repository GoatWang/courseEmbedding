the course of history to examine but carroll had two unique aspects that made me want to write about him specifically he was one of the youngest serial killers ever based on the date of his first kill and he is a prolific example of how grandly the legal system can fail not only society but a single individual cole grew up with a deep hatred of women this hatred was bred by his mother whom often took young cole with her as she had extramarital affairs with men while his father was fighting in world war ii after his father’s return cole continued to be beaten and belittled by his mother she even forced him to dress in frilly skirts and petticoats for the amusement of her friends at age nine he drowned a playmate who made fun of his name calling him a sissy he escaped punishment when

crossroad of puritanism and enlightenment jonathan edwards is a fascinating individual in eighteenth century literature and one of the most important figures of his time he is the son and grandson of puritan preachers and a product of a puritan background he is known as an enlightenment philosopher theologian orator and scientist edwards is a leading figure in the early years of the “great awakening” a period of bringing puritans back to their former religion and reintroducing old practices which spread rapidly from northampton to massachusetts to connecticut edwards writing style was shaped by his upbringing and education and strict puritan influences intense passion and feeling is the driving force behind his writings the rise and fall in his life as a preacher from being popular to being dismissed is similar to his own personal moments of revelation to moments of utter despair early puritan themes in writing consisted of practical and purposeful matters puritan writers sought to glorify god by being humble especially in writing rules were very strict and possibly led to edwards strive for perfection in many aspects of his life edwards “belonged to an elite extended family

kendall writes thomas explores his fascination with the unimportant in this poem and looks at the connection and merging together of spring and winter much like his other poetry here thomas struggles to put his finger on precisely what he means this is shown by his inability to separate and distinguish between the two seasons the poem begins with the first two lines focussing on spring however by following this with two lines focussing on winter thomas explodes our first expectations of usual ‘spring poetry’ of bright and beautiful images instead he catches the limbo between the two seasons and we are presented with the idea of the grass being ‘long dead’ and ‘greyer now’ this pessimistic tone is not what one usually connotes with springtime but with the cold and bleak winter by putting the images of the two seasons so close together in this stanza thomas reinforces his presentation of their connection the last line of the stanza ‘than all the winter it was’ changes the natural syntax of the words the stress focuses of ‘it was’ emphasising what has past which creates a sense of longing introducing the idea that like in ‘march’ thomas is desperate to find ‘the key’ the last two lines of the first stanza finish with the words ‘now and ‘was’ bringing together images of the movement of time and emphasising the gap between   words    pages lewis carroll essay lewis carroll is one of the most well known nonsense writers though using nonsense in poetry has been dismissed as simply for entertainment purposes most nonsensical poetry acts as an allegory has deep symbolism and leaves the door wide open for varying interpretations lewis carroll has utilized this sense with nonsense through his poems and prose found in his novels alice in wonderland and through the lookingglass  through carrolls interactions with his close friends and family and the innovative and eccentric society and politics of the victorian era he has created beautiful poetry with many different levels the victorian era lasted from  until  which was the time during queen victorias reign in england the term victorian has conveyed connotations of prudish repress and old fashionedlandow  this era is now seen as a time of  great expansion of wealth power and culturelandow  this change in ideas and politics led to great change in democracy and saw a rise in other modern movements since the era lasted for so long it is comprised of several different periods including socialism darwinism and scientific agnosticism the widespread use of opium during the victorian period may have influenced or been reflected in carrolls work in carrolls time five out of six families used opium habituallywohl  the victorian era ideology and politics had a great impact on lewis carrolls

fields there are plenty of organic shapes as well most notably of course is the shape of the river’s bend but also the more subtle questionmark shape of the birds flying in formation you can also make
