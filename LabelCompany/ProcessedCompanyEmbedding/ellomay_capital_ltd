and to enhance its shareholders ability to influence the compensation of the companys directors and officers   the compensation p p olicy is worded in the masculine form only for purposes of convenience and is designated for equal and identical application to women and men without any difference or change   it is stressed that this c c ompensation p p olicy does not grant any rights to the company’s directors and officers and the adoption of this c c ompensation p p olicy per se will not grant any of the company’s directors and officers a right to receive any component of compensation set forth in this c c ompensation p p olicy the components of compensation to which a director or officer will be entitled will be exclusively those that are determined specifically in relation to him in accordance with the requirements of the israeli companies law  and the regulations promulgated thereunder together the “companies law”   it is clarified that in the event a director or officer receives compensation that is less than the compensation in accordance with this c c ompensation p p olicy it will not be regarded as a deviation from this c c ompensation p p olicy and such terms of his service or employment will not necessitate the approval of the general meeting that is required in the event of approval of terms of service and employment that deviate from the compensation policy    general      compensation policy purposes   the compensation policy is designed to support the achievement of the companys long term work plan goals and ensure that       officers interests are as closely as possible aligned with the interests of ellomays shareholders       the correlation between pay and performance will be enhanced               ellomay will be able to recruit and retain top level senior managers capable of leading the company to further business success and facing the challenges ahead       company ellomay’s officers will be motivated to achieve a high level of business performance without taking unreasonable risks       an appropriate balance will be established between different compensation elements – fixed vs variable short term vs long term and cash payments vs equity based compensation      the organs involved in the determination of the compensation policy are        compensation committee – provides the bod as hereinafter defined with recommendations regarding the appropriate compensation policy the required updates to the compensation policy and its renewal and approves directors and officers service and employment terms and conditions       board of directors “bod” – approves the compensation policy for directors and officers and is responsible for periodical reviews of the compensation policy and its updating if necessary       the general meeting of shareholders – approves the compensation policy for directors and officers to the extent that such an approval is required by law      business environment and its impact on company officers compensation   ellomay is in the business of energy and infrastructure with operations that currently mainly include production of renewable and clean energy the compensation policy is intended to ensure the company’s ability to retain and recruit a dedicated and experienced professional management that will be able to successfully promote the company’s interests and manage its business operations and assets    compensation of directors and officers in view of the companys values and strategy      the connection between the companys results and officers compensation   we believe the total compensation of our officers should be influenced by our business results as well as each officers individual contribution to the achievement of these results     a          the ratio between the compensation of directors   and   officers and the other employees of the company including contractors   the compensation committee and the bod will review from time to time the ratio between the total cost of employment of each of officers and theaverage and median salaries of the rest of the employees includingcontractors as well as the ratio between the total cost of employment of each of the directors and officers and the average and median cost of employment of the rest of the employees including contractors and discuss its possible impact on labor relations within the company   in the opinion of the compensation committee and bod members the current ratio is appropriate and reasonable in view of the nature of the company its size the mixture of manpower and its field of operation and has no negative impact on the labor relations within the company    basic concepts of the companys compensation policy   directors’ and officers compensation should include a number of elements so that each of these elements rewards a different aspect of their overall contribution to the company’s success     · fixed base salary director fees or management service fee – compensates directors and officers for the time they devote to performing their roles in the company and for the daily performance of their tasks the fixed base salary correlates to the officers skills such as experience position knowledge expertise education professional qualifications etc on the one hand and to the job requirements as well as the authority and responsibilities the job caries on the other hand     · social and incidental benefits –several of the social benefits are mandatory according to different local legislation such as pension and long term savings severance pay vacation sick leave etc others are provided according to market specific conventions and enable the company to compete in the working environment such as education funds and company cars in israel and the remainder are meant to complement the fixed base salary and compensate the officers for expenses incurred in connection with their job requirements such as travel expenses or allowances     · variable performance based rewards annual bonus commissions and grants – reward directors and officers for their contributions to the company’s success and achievement of business goals during a pre defined timeframe     · equity based compensation – designed to strengthen the link between long term shareholders’ returns and the company’s directors’ and officers’ rewards this type of reward creates a stronger correlation between directors’ and officers’ motivation and interest and the interests of the company’s shareholders another significant effect of equity based compensation is its contribution to retention due to its inherent long term characteristics     a       to ensure an adequate fit of all reward elements and the appropriate construction of the total compensation package all compensation elements of a company director or officer will be presented to the approving organ prior to approval of any specific payment or reward    compensation elements      fixed compensation    fixed compensation base salary and benefits  for the company’s directors and officers other than non ‐ employee and external directors will be as

services and for management services based on a management services agreement should the company resolve to retain the services of directors or officers performing similar functions who are not representatives of controlling shareholders this policy will apply    these amounts will be linked to increases in the israeli cpi    usd rate of    nis   a deviation of up to  above these amounts

within said range will reflect the officers skills and fit into the intended position   in israel the company’s officers are naturally exempt from the provisions of the israeli working and rest hours law as they hold senior managerial positions as defined in such law therefore they are not entitled to any additional compensation for overtime      market comparisons benchmark   in order to set the
