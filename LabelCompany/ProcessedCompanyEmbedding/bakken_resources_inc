managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in this quarterly report on form q the quarterly report and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   the  annual report as filed with the sec on october   in addition to historical information this discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those identified in the  annual report in the section entitled risk factors overview bakken resources inc the company bri we us or our is an independent energy company focused on holding nonworking interests in oil and natural gas properties throughout north america bakkens primary focus since inception has been the williston basin in western north dakota the company owns mineral rights to approximately  gross acres and  net mineral acres of land located about  miles southeast of williston north dakota the companys land assets consist generally of net mineral acres spanning from the subsurface to the base of the socalled rock unit in an area commonly referred to as the bakken formation a nonworking interest simply means that the company doesnt bear either the risk or the financial burden attributable to exploration and production of oil and natural gas wells the company simply invests in successful wells or projects that have demonstrated a high degree of success the company partners with strong operators to explore and develop oil and natural gas from company leases during the first quarter of  the company received royalty and overriding royalty payments on seventyfive  producing oil wells seventytwo  of which also produce natural gas this production and proved reserves are as follows producing average proved percent q of  wells daily reserves proved average production developed price oil   bbls  bbls   natural gas   mcf  mcf   bbls  barrels   mcf  thousand cubic feet the leases comprising the companys mineral rights average  when the mineral rights were transferred from holms energy llc holms energy llc retained a  overriding royalty therefore these mineral rights currently bear to us an average  royalty  less  from the oil and gas produced on such lands until november  at that time the  overriding royalty currently held by holms energy llc a related private nevada company holms energy will revert back to the company the companys average net royalty interest is further reduced by the approved north dakota industrial commission ndic well spacing units attributable to each of the sixteen spacing units the net average royalty percentage in  was  we currently have leases with three contracted oil drilling operators on various parcels of land constituting the  gross acres and approximately  net mineral acres on which we have mineral rights royalty interests the contracted oil drilling companies with whom we are parties in interest pursuant to lease agreements collectively the lessees that we acquired rights to in november  include  oasis petroleum  continental resources inc and  statoil asa we have no rights or ability to influence the activities conducted by these lessees of our mineral rights but if the lessees do not accomplish the agreed upon drilling programs within the timeline lessees can lose their leases the predecessor to our company was incorporated on june   under the laws of the state of nevada under the name multisys language solutions inc mls holms energy contributed the primary assets that formed the basis of our current business operations in connection with the closing of the transactions resulting in the contribution of the mineral rights held by holms energy in november  holms energy received forty million  shares of common stock of the company holms energy retained a  overriding royalty on all gross revenue generated from the companys gas and oil production royalty revenues  also in connection with the november  transactions the company purchased approximately  net mineral acres from the revocable living trust of rocky g greenfield and evenette g greenfield the company sold these  net mineral acres to a third party in february of  the company retained a two percent  overriding royalty on the sale of these mineral rights the mineral rights received by the company from the contribution by holms energy in connection with the november  transactions included mineral rights from the surface to the base of the bakken formation the mineral rights received by the company from the greenfields include all mineral rights from the surface to the basement after closing the asset purchase agreement with holms energy on december   mls changed its name to bakken resources inc these transactions and the resulting change of control are described below under acquisition of assets description of oil leases and oil production bri currently derives its primary source of revenue from royalties generated from leasing its mineral acreage bris mineral acreage consists of approximately  net mineral acres located primarily in mckenzie county north dakota such  net mineral acres are currently spread across  spacing units operators covering bris minerals have been approved for up to  wells per spacing unit typically  acres but generally petition for permits prior to the commencement of drilling in a particular spacing unit if this holds for all spacing units under which bri has mineral acres bri would have a royalty interest in up to  wells note however that the royalties due to bri under any particular well vary based on the number of acres bri has under any particular spacing unit with a producing well with respect to drilling operations pursuant to the north dakota oil and gas commission long lateral deep horizontal multistage fracking wells in the bakken formation must be permitted in spacing unit of not less than  acres up to  acres with some exceptions the spacing units have to be approved and permitted in advance of drilling by the north dakota oil and gas commission recently the north dakota industrial commission ndic has approved multiwell permits for wells drilled in the three forks formation along several of the defined benches typically associated with separate geologic benchmarks contained in the three forks formation since approximately onethird of the companys current net mineral acres include acreage in the three forks formation any increase in the drilling operations on the companys net mineral acres which include permitted for three forks wells may result an increased number of total wells from which the company may derive royalty income when a horizontal well is drilled in the area where the subject property is located it is typically drilled down about  vertical feet and then a downhole directional drilling tool is used to flatten the hole to  degrees and drill horizontally down the oil and gas producing formation horizontal directional drilling provides more contact area to the oil bearing formation than a typical vertical well this method of drilling together with fracking is referred to as an enhanced oil recovery method and is the primary source of recovery from the bakken formation the company also has interests in certain wells not drilled into the bakken formation well activity information for wells in which the company has mineral interests are compiled in a table which is available on the company web site at httpwwwbakkenresourcesinccomwellactivity the information provided in the websites table is categorized by well name operator field and pool the ndic identifying number and the well status and location description well status is defined by several categories producing confidential drilling and permitted location to drill the table is updated as new information becomes available on the ndic website at httpswwwdmrndgovoilgas included in the table are ndic file numbers which can be used to search for information for each well listed on the bri webpage individuals may subscribe to the ndic website following the prompts on the homepage a premium service subscription is also available for a fee currently most of the leases covering the companys mineral acres contain what is commonly referred to as continuous drilling clauses generally a continuous drilling clause requires an operator to maintain active drilling operations in order to hold or extend an oil and gas lease past the natural expiration date of the lease all of the companys current leases currently have active drilling operations and are likely to have active operations in the foreseeable future results of operations comparison of the three months ended march   and march   revenue  we generated net revenue gross revenue less production taxes and deductions for the three months ended march   totaling  compared to revenue of  for the three months march   the decrease relative to  reflects the sale of the greenfield assets  of total mineral acres and declining oil and natural gas unit prices sixty percent  although unit prices are down relative to the first quarter  production is at record highs first quarter oil production totaled  barrels up  from  similarly natural gas production totaled  mcf up  from  throughout  the company saw many new wells initiate production this trend continued into  the producing well count at march   seventy four  increased by twenty four  wells compared to march   the company currently has seventyfour  producing wells twentythree  permitted wells seven  wells in confidential status and six  wells being drilled  revenue is driven by product unit prices and volume although the company sold  of its mineral rights in  and production unit prices have declined more than sixty  since  highs new well production is sustaining revenue as unit prices rebound new production will continue to drive revenue and profitability the state of north dakota establishes spacing rules that dictate how many wells can be drilled and operated over a defined area acres based upon current spacing units the company has current potential well capacity totaling one hundred ninety wells  therefore the company has capacity for an additional eighty  wells these potential additional wells offer little risk since they will be drilled into known reserves where existing wells are already producing successfully therefore current year and future revenue will likely continue to increase without a significant increase in operating expenses operating expenses  operating expenses fell sharply by approximately  or forty seven percent  from march   compared to march   driven by substantially lower legal and professional fees  several contracted positions have been consolidated into existing staff legal costs are also decreasing as a result of director and officers insurance reimbursement for costs relating to the derivative lawsuit and as litigation has decreased general and administrative expenses were  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the same period in  the net loss for the first quarter  totaled  down from income of  in the first quarter  the first quarter  results include the  gain on the sale of proved mineral rights our material financial obligations include our salaries paid to our only current employee fees paid to outside consultants public company reporting expenses transfer agent fees bank fees and other recurring fees liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had cash of  compared to  as of december   as of march   the company has expended  to acquire the big willow lease the company has  in remaining bonus payments on the big willow lease the company also expects that title work to determine the net mineral acres will total approximately  this work is slated to be completed by june   operating costs consist mainly of salaries office rent and professional fees and is consistent with general operating cash used in prior quarters net cash providedused by operations for the period ended march   was  compared to  during the three months ended march   the sharp reduction reflects lower professional fees attributable to the number of lawsuits in which the company is currently involved the  figures include extraordinary onetime expenses attributable to the sale of mineral rights as suits have been settled or dismissed the companys legal fees have fallen it also reflects reimbursement for legal expenses from the companys director and officer insurance policy it also reflects the consolidation of two contractor positions totaling  per month into the corporate secretary and cfo positions given our recent rate of use of cash in our operations we believe we have sufficient capital to carry on operations for the next year our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including the reporting company costs public relations fees and operating expenses among others in the future we anticipate we will be able to provide the necessary liquidity from royalty revenues related to sale of oil reserves of existing properties no assurances however can be given that such royalties will continue to be received as of march   the royalty revenues received have been sufficient to provide liquidity during the previous twelve months if the company does not generate sufficient revenues it will continue to finance operations through equity or debt financings we will continue to evaluate additional properties containing mineral rights that we may seek to acquire with respect to transactions involving the acquisition of additional mineral rights or other business collaboration transactions we may seek to issue shares of our common stock or other equity to finance part or all such acquisitions or transactions to the extent that such acquisitions or transactions require cash payments such payments will likely have a material impact on our liquidity our proposed operations may require additional capital from outside sources however we may not be successful in obtaining cash from new or existing agreements or in receiving royalty payments under our existing leases in addition we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when needed or that if available financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders having insufficient funds may require us to delay scale back or eliminate some or all of our business development activities failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern if we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business  satisfaction of our cash obligations for the next twelve  months a critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is the ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity or debt financing and jv drilling partnerships in the event we cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan we may have to cease or significantly curtail our operations this would materially impact our ability to continue operations however due to our low base overhead we are not dependent on new capital if we do not wish to develop our drilling programs or buy up working interests in potential wells during the next twelve  months since inception we have financed cash flow requirements through debt financing and issuance of common stock for cash and services as we expand operational activities we may continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations pending receipt of sales or development fees and will be required to obtain additional financing to fund operations through common stock offerings and debt borrowings to the extent necessary to provide working capital over the next twelve months we believe that existing capital and anticipated funds from operations will be sufficient to sustain current operations we may seek additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion through additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities no assurance can be made that such financing would be available and if available it may take either the form of debt or equity in either case the financing could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our stockholders we have information that an additional thirty six  wells are either permitted drilling or are in confidential status although we believe that our income from our wells will likely reduce or eliminate operating losses in the near future we have no control over the timing of when we will receive such royalty payments in addition there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing operational risks and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations offbalance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any offbalance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital

requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition the timing of the royalty revenues and income taxes we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical we make many other accounting estimates in

financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of march   because certain elements of an effective control environment were not present as of march   including the
