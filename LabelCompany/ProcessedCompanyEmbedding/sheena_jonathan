reprints twitter save article ron leuty reporter san francisco business times enlarge jonathan sheena founded natera inc the prenatal testing industry is shaping up as one of the most competitive in the medical diagnostics arena and the bay area has become a center of innovation and newcompany formation with the likes of aria diagnostics in san jose verinata health in redwood city and natera inc in san carlos whats more as my colleague diana samuels wrote earlier this year the fight has turned to the courtroom as bay area test makers challenge each other and sequenom inc nasdaq sqnm the san diegobased company that was first to the market with a noninvasive test enlarge jonathan sheena founded natera inc the competition makes it all the more important for these companies to prove that their technology is best and one of the more aggressive companies in that regard has been natera the employee company formerly known as gene security network has doubled its workforce this year most recently bringing on former exelixis and genentech executive gautam kollu as vice president of marketing and business development it moved in may from redwood city to new digs in san carlos and earlier this year it completed a  million funding round with sequoia capital lightspeed venture partners and claremont creek ventures the company launched tests in  and  that screened embryos at in vitro fertilization clinics for down syndrome another test in  provides information about extra or mission chromosomes deletions or duplications and a noninvasive paternity test hit the market last year this year it introduced a test to determine whether parents carry one or more gene mutations and later this year it expects to start selling a noninvasive prenatal diagnostic or nipd that detects genetic abnormalities including for down syndrome edwards syndrome patau syndrome and certain sex chromosome abnormalities i spoke recently with jonathan sheena nateras founder and chief technology officer about the companys noninvasive prenatal tests its ongoing clinical trials its hiring and its attempts to win insurance coverage for its tests q have you settled into the new building sheena over the past year we grew out of the redwood city space and on may  we moved to new space in san carlos we moved from  square feet to  square feet we were bursting at the seams in redwood city in the past year weve more than doubled headcount were now over  people q why all the hiring sheena it supports our new test that we launched and the upcoming nipd test we launched our paternity test last year and the screening test earlier this year we have several nipd trials including the prenatal trial and we released initial validation data q so many life sciences companies have been holding tight on hiring trying to be more efficient what were some of the internal discussions before you decided to bring on more people sheena its hard to know when to pull the trigger but we made sure the test met the needs of the market since we know something performs better and provides better clinical coverage we were confident to begin staffing the staffing supports tests that were selling already so we can hire people and they have something to sell q in which areas of expertise have you hired sheena we staffed up the lab to support the increase in samples we staffed up ga for customer support and insurance billing which we deal with on behalf of patients and our sales team and we continued to round out the rd team the rd teams getting bigger despite the fact that weve launched not smaller were also staffing up marketing we brought in gautam kollu from exelixis and our coo brad roberts in the past year q what are the costs of the tests sheena the paternity test  the first noninvasive test  is billed at about  in the us and distributed through ddc dna diagnostics center and others the priortoconception test is covered by insurance with a low outofpocket cost testing in in vitro fertilization ranges from about  to  depending on the complexity of the test q have you had to fight with insurers for coverage sheena there are a number of the big players that have positive policies for priortoconception to help women who have had multiple miscarriages some insurers are very supportive some not supportive we published one paper on priortoconception and another one is coming out to show the clinical utility of the priortoconception test for insurers our test can find something indicative of a molar pregnancy a molar pregnancy occurs when tissue that normally develops into a fetus instead forms an abnormal growth in the uterus when you have a molar you cant go to term with the pregnancy and its an indicator to watch for certain cancers it provides closure to the mother on why the miscarriage happened but you can detect certain things to watch for cancer we started this journey in ivf  we tested embryos three days after conception  and added the priortoconception test that has added utility q whats the money behind natera sheena we have three sources of funding we get revenue from our current tests venture backing from sequoia lightspeed and claremont creek and our third backing is from nih grants for developing a number of our tests were the only company with nih backing for nipd tests q are noninvasive prenatal diagnostics the summit of product development in this space sheena it has the broadest reach the biggest impact on lives its the next summit but there are other summits right after that there are all sorts of directions that you can take this nipd testing were excited by the nipd tests because they have twice the clinical coverage and shorter turnaround times and higher accuracy because of the different approach we take the industry standard is about two weeks to  business days for turnaround time our informatics allow us to have a moretargeted approach shorter turnaround time were launching with a sevenday guarantee ron covers biotech and
