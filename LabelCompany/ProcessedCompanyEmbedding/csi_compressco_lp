a range over the last month from  to  per barrel of west texas intermediate wti while it is too early to claim that a bottom for crude prices has been made it is not too early to look for bargains in the og sector i believe csi compressco lp nasdaq cclp is one of those bargain companies with upside potential even with the current low crude oil and natural gas prices cclp has significant upside potential when crude oil andor natural gas prices turn back up csi compressco lp  the company cclp is a master limited partnership mlp that provides compressionbased production enhancement services for natural gas and oil production companies its production enhancement services are used in both conventional wellhead compression applications and unconventional compression applications the companys conventional applications include production enhancement for dry gas wells for liquidloaded gas wells and backside auto injection systems for liquidloaded gas wells the companys conventional applications are primarily associated with mature gas wells with low formation pressures and on gas wells that have experienced significant production declines unconventional compression applications are utilized primarily in connection with oil and liquids production and include vapor recovery and casing gas system applications cclp also provides ongoing well monitoring automated sand separation and lubrication and maintenance in addition cclp designs and manufactures compressor units including natural gas powered gasjack compressors to provide conventional wellhead and unconventional compression services electric vjack compressors to provide production enhancement services on wells located in mature oil fields and superjack packages to provide artificial lift production enhancement services on vertical and horizontal wells with insufficient reservoir pressure the company has operations in the united states mexico canada south america europe and the asiapacific region compressco partners gp inc gp serves as the general partner of cclp the gp is  percent owned by tetra technologies inc nyse tti the company was formerly known as compressco partners lp and changed its name to csi compressco lp in december  csi compressco lp was founded in  and is headquartered in oklahoma city oklahoma the figure below represents the ownership structure of csi compressco lp note that the figure below is prior to the acquisition of compressor systems inc csi while the ownership structure is the same ttis ownership has been reduced to  of cclp versus the previous  of compressco partners lp csi compressco lp  products and services cclp provides a wide range of compressor sizes from  hp up to  hp and platforms including small trailer mounted medium skid mounted and large fixed compressor installations cclps product line of compressors provides high value added solutions to increase production and recoverable reserves in existing oil and gas wells an example is cclps gasjack well casing gas system prior to the system installation gas production was  mcfd and oil production was  bopd in the existing well after cclps gasjack well casing gas system gas production increased to  mcfd and oil production rose to  bopd the figure below was taken from a cclp investor presentation on cclps product and service offerings and provides a schematic of the cclp gasjack well casing gas system in addition to compressor systems cclp provides a full suite of compressor services including engineering installation operation monitoring repair and maintenance the cclp website has a very informative investor presentation pdf that describes in much more detail cclps product and services offerings the presentation can be found here i believe there is an important take away here with respect to cclps product and service offerings in the current og environment with drilling rigs being laid down and capex budgets being cut production companies will be looking hard at technologies and applications that will increase production and recoverable reserves on their existing wells with low crude oil prices producers will be looking for technologies to squeeze more barrels of oil and more cubic feet of gas from their existing wells cclps products and services help producers do exactly that csl compressco lp  past performance and forecast cclp recently reported on  q and  full year financials and it was a very good quarter the  q results include a full quarter after the recent acquisition of csi revenue came in at m beating analysts expectations by m cclps ebitda for  q was m unadjusted and m after adjustment for onetime costs of the csi acquisition distributable cash flow dcf was m with a coverage ratio of  cclps compressor fleet utilization increased to  from  for  q providing a solid start to  cclp ended  with m in cash and m available from their existing credit facility cclp grew significantly in  with the acquisition of csi the following charts of revenue and ebitda clearly show the large pop in  cclp revenue growth cclp ebitda growth the  revenue and ebitda forecasts in the charts above are based on the midpoint of cclp guidance provided in the  q and full year financials recently reported the guidance for  provided by cclp reflects the current og low price environment the cclp dcf per limited partner unit is provided in the chart below note the  q distribution increase was  over that provided in  q the th consecutive increase in the last  quarters the growth in unit holder distributions is respectable but modest reflecting cclps organic growth and acquisition activity the compound annual growth rate cagr since cclp started paying distributions is  for the last  years the distribution cagr was  with the recent csi acquisition cclp effectively doubled its enterprise value to b and significantly increased its revenue and ebitda with a healthy  distribution coverage ratio cclp has room to increase unit holder distributions going forward while cclp management has not provided any guidance on unit holder distributions for  the  ebitda guidance reflects an  increase over  q im expecting cclp will share that new wealth with unit holders csi compressco lp  financial health metrics cclp is a relatively new company and has just swallowed a large acquisition in  q id expect cclp to have some debt and they do however cclps debt is quite manageable the cclp debt metrics are as follows long term debt to total capitalization is  this is a little higher than id prefer and reflects the borrowing that cclp made in its acquisition of csi it should be noted that the long term debt number i used was for  q reporting immediately after the csi acquisition cclp has not yet made available their  q or full year balance sheet and so i dont have an updated long term debt number however cclp would have made payments on that debt during the fourth quarter of  and it should be a bit lower than the m reported in  q any reduction in long term debt from the m would improve the  ratio long term debt to ebitda is  a number below  is generally what i look for and cclp meets that criteria this metric indicates that cclps debt is reasonable compared to their ebitda cclps ebitda to interest on debt is  i generally look for a number north of  to indicate the company should have no trouble servicing their debt cclp easily meets that criteria prospective investors should note that cclp has yet to achieve an investment grade credit rating from sp or moodys cclps sp credit rating is b with a stable outlook the rating is
