founded  headquarters radnor pennsylvania us number of employees  website wwwactuacom actua corporation nasdaq acta is a publicly traded venture capital firm the company was formerly known as icg group inc and changed its name to actua corporation in september  historyedit this section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably please consider splitting content into subarticles condensing it or adding or removing subheadings january  in early  safeguard scientifics executives ken fox and walter buckley spotted an emerging market in businesstobusiness ecommerce or bb as it would become known they left their former employer to found internet capital group icg a venture capital firm aimed at this new business sector buckley explained we liked bb because we knew who the customers were and could see they would be easier to lock in than consumers bb is grimy and dirty but you can make a lot of money at it the pair asked safeguard head pete musser for  million in funding but he insisted on investing  million by may when initial funding completed buckley and fox had raised  million to start icg twice what they had hoped for in addition to safeguard major investors included comcast compaq and bancboston ventures and a dozen or so individuals initially the company was organized as a limitedliability corporation following the keiretsu model used by safeguard icg would be heavily involved in the operations of the companies it invested in and the startups would do business with each other increasing the value of all parties its annual meetings would become opportunities for ceos to share their experiences and cut new deals one member ceo called it a perfect way to manage chaos one of icgs first investments was a website called water online under the guidance of icg water online brought in mark walsh head of aols bb division in late  to run the company the company became verticalnet expanded into  different industries and became one of the first bb companies to go public spurning opportunities to invest in promising businesstoconsumer companies such as cdnow and autoweb icg impressed its core audience and developed a reputation as the vcs to see if you were an entrepreneur with a bb idea ge capital joined many of the original investors in contributing to a second round of financing in july  which generated another  million early investments began to pay off and icg generated additional funds by selling off some of its positions however unlike traditional venture capitalists buckley and fox envisioned that icg would hold most of its investments longterm ten years or longer the duo were ambitious aiming to have a stake in  of the bb market and saw icg as the ge of ecommerce – they wanted each of their investments to be a toptwo player in their market to support this goal icg aggressively hired top talent from companies such as microsoft mckinsey  co and ge itself the work environment was casual or as one partner company ceo called it almost like a fraternity by fall  icg began considering an initial public offering ipo it went on a hiring spree to beef up its profile hiring executives away from cambridge technology partners heidrick  struggles mckinsey and softbank after much effort fox persuaded sam jadallah microsofts chief of enterprise sales and marketing to join in february  the decision was made to go public and icg converted to a regular corporation that month in may  million of additional funding was raised through a convertible bond issue in august the ipo was completed through merrill lynch becoming listed on the nasdaq under the symbol icge the symbol was chosen in reference to icgs goal of being the next general electric i see ge icg sold  million shares in the offering at  per share and simultaneously sold another  million shares privately to ibm generating more than  million total dell computer bought  million of the ipo shares and wanted more highprofile investors now included amerindo investment advisors the saudi royal family the penske family and david bonderman safeguard was the largest stakeholder at the time of the ipo icg held stakes in  companies about half the businesses aimed to create online marketplaces or communities while the other half were software makers and other companies building the infrastructure to meet the needs of the marketplace companies icgs business model was exciting to analysts – fortune magazine called it a onestock way to play the net – but also extremely difficult to accurately value analyst henry blodget was among its more vocal supporters declaring internet capital has the potential to emerge as the dominant stcentury operating model for creating shareholder value he predicted the companys stock would be worth  per share within two years based on a  share of the bb ecommerce market in the midst of the dotcom bubble the ipo was a huge success icge doubled in price on its first day and hit  per share in october book value of the company including stakes in verticalnet and us interactive which had gone public was about  billion for no significant revenue that meant the market was valuing the icg management team at about  billion the stock continued to rise by early december it was trading above  icg had by then invested  million across  startups and had a staff of  to manage and advise those companies operations were split into two locations with buckley serving as ceo and working out of the philadelphia area while fox managed west coast operations in san francisco three executives were hired in november to head a new european team icge stock then proceeded to surge  in  days to hit  a share a figure that would represent its alltime high at  a share icg had a market value of nearly  billion which made it the third largest internet company by market capitalization behind only aol and yahoo the rise came despite a secondary offering which raised  billion in additional capital revenue meanwhile was meager during the first nine months after icg became a corporation it recorded  million of revenue and a loss of  million the previous year it recorded a profit of  million on  million of revenue in an early december before the stock peaked motley fool analyst bill mann remarked icg is valued very richly on a series of unproven concepts manifested in small unprofitable companies run by unproven management teams by february  icgs stock had retreated nearly  in anticipation of insiders selling when their shares would unlock in february quick  reilly filed to sell  shares while bancboston investment filed to sell  however dotcom fever remained strong and retail investors bought up insider shares stabilizing the price meanwhile icg continued to expand its investments by early  icg had invested  billion in  startup firms and was forging new partnerships with old economy leaders for example icg took a substantial stake in metalsite an online metal exchanged backed by established steelmakers and partnered with dupont to launch capspan an online market place for duponts goods the rapid expansion was motivated by what fox called the biggest wealthcreation opportunity the world has ever seen – finding the promising ecommerce bb companies before anyone else the nasdaq peaked in march and when dotcom fever began to fade icg was especially hard hit by april its stock was down to  a share and ge capital filed to sell nearly a million shares by june icge was down to  and by november it hit  per share buckley who sold very little of his own stock remained optimistic we have never been more confident of what were building he said that month the market doesnt know that but it will in spring  the stock price fell into single digits and fell below  per share in the summer putting it in danger of being delisted by nasdaq despite the fall the company was financially sound with  million in the bank two years after its peak icg had a market capitalization of  million less than  of its peak value icg survived the crash and changed its business model instead of taking small stakes in many companies it would invest in a few core companies at a time usually as majority owner this allowed the company to have much greater control over the operations of its investments icge stock bottomed out in  at  per share stock analyst jeff van rhee commented years later like many people they got caught up in the implosion of the bubble but boy that trial by fire has really honed their abilities when icg sold its stake in channel intelligence to google for  million in february  the stock had risen by  per share by september  icge was trading in the upper teens and was worth approximately  million as of  buckley was actuas ceo
