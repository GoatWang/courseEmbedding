with nbc and iac’s acquisition of precision response corpsonyon june   sir howard stringer sony corp’s chairman and chief executive officer hired him as chief strategic officer for sony broadband entertainment  a move described in fortune as one of stringer’s “smartest moves” sony broadband entertainment now known as sony entertainment was established in march  to house the corporation’s us entertainment assets its film and television studio and music groupwiesenthal moved quickly to buy and sell stakes in a variety of businesses in  he sold  percent of sony’s game show network to liberty digital and sony’s stake in telemundo to nbcuniversal a deal worth over  billion he had sony join with philips nv to buy intertrust technologies the owner of patents for most digitalrightsmanagement technologies he negotiated “strategic transactions” between sony and yahoo inc and thenaol time warner inc at sony pictures entertainment he oversaw a corporate restructuring called “the st century studio project” that resulted in savings of over  million at sony’s studio operations among the biggest changes was at sony pictures’ us network television production where he greatly reduced the number of television series it produced wiesenthal told the new york times “we asked ourselves the tough questions in each of sony pictures’ businesses to ensure the underlying economics made sense in the current environment”on january   wiesenthal was promoted to sony’s executive vice president and chief financial officer a move that the wall street journal described as a strategy that sony used to improve its stature in the business world in april  he was named to a sevenmember committee of executives to oversee the operations of sony pictures entertainment in june

traveled to the middle east and met jackson in a gilded dubai hotel room he told jackson that sony had backers from citi who were willing to refinance jackson’s atv debt on much better terms in exchange sony obtained greater operational control over the business a right of refusal on his stake and an option to buy half of jackson’s half for approximately  million these moves helped consolidate sony’s control of the unitafter obtaining greater authority over the operations of sonyatv wiesenthal led sonyatv’s acquisitions of the leiber stoller and viacom’s famous music catalogs in  in  in an effort to bolster the management strength of sony’s publishing operations wiesenthal recruited martin bandier chairman and cochief executive of emi group’s emi music publishing unit to be chief executive of sonyatv wiesenthal believes music publishing companies are well equipped to compete and be successful in the music industry of the future unlike traditional record companies they don’t have manufacturing sales distribution or expensive label structures and their model is completely based on licensing rights across all users and media “lenders—whether private lenders or banks—feel much more comfortable with the credit quality of publishing vs recorded music” wiesenthal said “in terms of the banks i speak with there’s clearly an interest on the publishing side”in  wiesenthal and his corporate development team enabled sony to be the first company to transmit a feature film directly to internetconnected televisions that were not covered by conventional cable and satellite distributors they offered the film hancock featuring will smith for a fee to customers with sonys internetconnected televisions prior to the film’s availability on dvd at the time laptops and pc’s were largely the only method in which customers could view digital streams of feature content wiesenthal said at the time “at the end of the day this project is about bringing digital entertainment back into the living room” wiesenthal followed this project with a similar early release of the animated children’s film “cloudy with a chance of meatballs” these initiatives provided owners of sony’s networked televisions with unique opportunities to watch early offerings of exclusive feature films they could not see over any competing television manufacturer’s sets as they were not available on dvd or payperviewalso in  he led the transaction to buy bertelsmann out of its half of sony bmg ending a joint venture formed in  stringer said the new sony music would give the group ‘far more flexibility’ to use music in its film and television units and in electronics including the playstation in a business known for oversized egos wiesenthal is described by industry executives as an exception nancy peretsman of allen  co described him as relatively egoless and always focused on the outcome in his role at sony entertainment he also oversaw sonyatv music publishing which was established in  as a joint venture between sony and trusts formed by michael jackson after separating music publishing from sony’s music assets after the merger of sony music and bmg’s music group howard stringer charged wiesenthal with the responsibility to grow sonyatv music publishing via acquisition a strategy that had previously fallen to the wayside when the business was previously part of sony’s music unit at the time sonyatv was the smallest of the major music publishing companiesin  wiesenthal and david zaslav ceo of discovery communications conceived of and structured a partnership bringing together the largest players in d to create the world’s first hour d network the network net launched on directv in  as a partnership between sony discovery communications and imax today net has the largest collection of d television content in the world sony owns  of the venture and wiesenthal sits on its board of directors wiesenthal also championed the sony dash the world’s first internet connected alarm clock for the bedside or desktop the dash provides an always on sequential display of over  apps including facebook status updates twitter streams and news and weather updates it is one of only a handful of sony consumer electronics products developed in the united statesin  wiesenthal orchestrated a complex deal acquiring emi publishing for  billion to an investor consortium led by sony the investor group included media mogul david geffen the estate of michael jackson blackstone’s gso’s capital partners mubadala development company the investment arm of abu dhabi and jynwel capital of hong kong “we found longterm investors who are not just looking at the shortterm returns typical of private equity” wiesenthal said the new york times in a deals of the year wrapup called it the “sleeper deal of ” one that “might have been the most interesting” billboard described wiesenthal as a “winner” in the deal he helped assemble a consortium of investors to buy emi music publishing as a result of the transaction sony now controls the largest collection of publishing copyrights in the world” bob pittman ceo of clear channel communications said he took it from being insignificant to being the biggestas sony entered the tablet market in  wiesenthal publicly discussed the important role of the marriage of tablets and television can play in the emerging connected television business he told a goldman sachs conference in new york that although five years previously “it was all about the boxes tivo slingbox roku i think the consumers really have box exhaustion” in their place tvs can evolve so they only have one wire the power cord consumers in turn he said will use tablets to access video content from the cloud and control the tv screen a user with a subscription to sony’s video unlimited or netflix could take a tablet to a friend’s house and “throw” a film to that friend’s tvwarner music groupin january   wiesenthal was hired as

warner music group became the very first major music company to receive royalties for their artists for radio airplay additionally the deal restructured the way the two companies economically interface on iheart custom digital radio as well as their multitude of online simulcast radio station the intent of the restructuring was to result in favorable to economics to both warner music group and clear channel as well as to increase warner music groups market share over iheart radio versus its major label competitors the wall street journal said if clear channel uses more of warner music’s records on its digital platforms for example that could translate to more terrestrial radio plays as part of the deal clear channel offered warner music an “enhanced” version of its “artist integration” initiative which advertises emerging artists on the air at clear channel’s expense clear channel offers other labels such promotions for just several weeks surrounding a new release but for warner music’s artists the promotions will run up to  weeks in the same wall street journal article wiesenthal said clear channel’s highvisibility live and televised events as well as its digital services will enable us propel our artists’ careers in an extremely competitive marketplace”in february  wiesenthal conceived and led the creation of a broad alliance with music discovery shazam the
