board of directors scientific advisors investor relations company history iris biotechnologies was established in  by its founder and ceo simon chin to fill the void that presently exists in our medical care system  the quick and accurate ability to categorize patients according to their genomic profile from the beginning iriss goal was to produce a reliable clinical breast cancer chip that predicts which treatment protocol is the most effective for every breast cancer patient iris has focused on developing robust accurate and reliable products for the clinical market three reputable university professors through a sixmonth research project independently validated our key technologies the nanobiochip gene expression system was created and designed to more precisely diagnose and identify actionable treatment choices at the time of the initial tissue biopsy the significant advantage of early prognosis determination and clinical intervention is to reduce medical costs and to improve the patient’s quality of life the proprietary nanobiochips are designed to be fdaapproved kits which can be used in any certified clinical laboratory until now most physicians have made medical decisions based solely upon generic professional knowledge and treatment experience with little or no insight into the molecular nature of their patient’s disease since the monumental achievement of sequencing the human genome progress in molecular biology has opened the door to uncovering the molecular portraits of disease the information provided by iris biotechnologies will help improve medical decision making in a way that will revolutionize the practice of medicine with its multiple patents costeffective parallel processing technologies and key business relationships in the us europe and asia iris biotechnologies is well positioned strategically and structurally to launch its first product a breastcancerchip™ other chips in our pipeline will include the human organ transplant hot™ chip neurochip™ cardiochip™ and metabolicchip™ for human use and specialized and proprietary chips for veterinary agricultural and environmental applications further growth is expected
