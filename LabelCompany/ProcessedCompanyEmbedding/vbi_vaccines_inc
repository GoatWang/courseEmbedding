disease and immunooncology vaccines today announced positive results from a planned interim data readout from a phase  study of its preventative cytomegalovirus cmv vaccine this interim data readout analyzed safety data through day  of the study and initial immunogenicity signals in participant samples collected one month after the second of three planned vaccine doses safety the vaccine was well tolerated at all doses with no safety signals immunogenicity the vaccine induced antibody responses against the cmv glycoprotein b gb antigen with clear evidence of dosedependent boosting after the second vaccination immunization with the highest dose of the vaccine induced seroconversion in  of subjects after just two vaccinations after two of the three planned vaccinations neutralizing antibodies against epithelial cell infection were demonstrated in  of subjects who received the highest dose of vbia the highest dose of vbia mcg of gbg content with alum has approximately fold less antigen content than that used in several other vlpbased vaccines or in past cmv vaccine candidates formulation of the vaccine with alum enhanced antibody titers this preplanned interim readout has provided us with an excellent early look at the safety and immunogenicity of our cmv vaccine candidate said jeff baxter president and ceo of vbi the safety and tolerability data is critical as this is the firstinhumans clinical study with a candidate generated from our enveloped viruslike particle evlp technology moreover we saw  seroconversion in subjects who received the highest dose of vbia a dosedependent boosting response and development of neutralizing antibodies in some patients after two doses providing us with confidence at this point that our vaccine is working as we intended we

completed a reverse takeover of levon levon changed its name from levon resources ltd to scivac therapeutics inc other than approximately cad  million in cash retained by levon all other assets and liabilities of levon were transferred or assumed by  bc ltd levons wholly owned subsidiary bc ltd additionally upon consummation of the levon merger each levon shareholder received  common shares of

symbol vbv vbi is a commercialstage biopharmaceutical company developing next generation vaccines to address unmet needs in infectious disease and immunooncology we currently manufacture our product scibvactm a third generation hepatitis b hbv vaccine for adults children and newborns which is approved for use in israel and  other countries scibvactm but has not yet been approved by the us food and drug administration the fda or the european medicines agency the ema the scibvactm vaccine has demonstrated safety and efficacy in over  patients in currently licensed markets several clinical trials have shown more rapid and higher rates of seroprotection with scibvactm than with glaxosmithklines engerixbr engerixbr is one of the standards of care to prevent hepatitis b infection globally vbi is nearing the completion of a phase iv clinical study in israel the purpose of this study was to confirm a new inhouse reference standard for regulatory and quality control purposes vbi is currently developing a clinical program to obtain fda and ema market approvals for commercial sale of scibvactm in the united states and the european union the eu respectively vbi recently received positive scientific advice from the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp of the ema regarding the companys development path for its scibvactm vaccine in europe in its letter the chmp expressed its support of vbis proposed plan to proceed to the phase iii clinical studies of scibvactm the chmp also agreed that the product information as well as data from ongoing studies supports the phase iii clinical studies and vbis planned filing of a market authorization application maa for scibvactm our whollyowned subsidiary in rehovot israel currently manufactures and sells scibvactm as a result of our acquisition of vbi vaccines delaware inc vbi de on may   see background of vbi de below we are developing novel technologies that seek to enhance vaccine protection in large underserved markets these include an enveloped virus like particle or evlp vaccine platform that allows for the design of enveloped viruslike particle vaccines that closely mimic the target viruses vbi is advancing a pipeline of evlp vaccines with lead programs in human cytomegalovirus cmv an infection that while common can lead to serious complications in babies and people with weak immune systems and is involved in the progression of glioblastoma multiforme gbm which is a form of brain cancer in september  the company completed the enrollment and initial dosing of  participants in the phase i clinical study to evaluate its preventative cmv vaccine candidate the phase i study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of vbis cmv vaccine candidate in  healthy cmvnegative adults the study will also measure levels of vaccineinduced cmv neutralizing antibodies that may prevent cmv infection preliminary results are anticipated in the first half of  the company is also advancing its lpvtm thermostability platform a proprietary formulation and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability potency and safety we may also seek to inlicense clinicalstage vaccines that we believe complement our product portfolio in addition to technologies that may supplement our therapeutic vaccination efforts in immunooncology at present the companys operations are focused on  manufacturing and sale of scibvactm in territories where it is currently registered  continuing the phase iv trial in israel as described above  preparing for scibvactm clinical trials to support various marketing authorizations in the us canada and europe  conducting human proofofconcept clinical trials with our cmv vaccine candidate  continuing preclinical development of our gbm vaccine candidate  scalingup manufacturing capabilities to commercialize products and dose forms for which we may obtain regulatory approval  continuing the research and development of our product candidates including the exploration and development of new product candidates  providing contracted services primarily to customers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors  adding operational financial and management information systems and human resources support including additional personnel to support our vaccine development  maintaining expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio vbis income generating activities have been from sales of its scibvactm product in markets that have generated a limited number of sales todate as well as fees from rd services vbi has also incurred significant net losses and negative operating cash flows since inception as of december   vbi had an accumulated deficit of approximately  million and stockholders equity of approximately  million our ability to maintain our status as an operating company is dependent upon obtaining adequate cash to finance our clinical development our administrative overhead and our research and development activities we plan to finance future operations with a combination of existing cash reserves proceeds from the issuance of equity securities the issuance of additional debt and revenues from potential collaborations if any there is no assurance the company will manage to obtain these sources of financing these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern we have incurred operating losses since inception have not generated significant product sales revenue and have not achieved profitable operations we incurred net losses of  million for the year ended december   and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we continue the clinical development of the scibvactm product and cmv vaccine candidate as well as advance our preclinicalstage product candidate gbm these include expenses related to  conducting human proofofconcept clinical trials including the continuation of the cmv phase i clinical trial a planned gbm phase i clinical trial and preparation for a scibvactm phase iii trial will require significant financial resources  continuing the research and development of our product candidates  scalingup manufacturing capabilities through subcontractors to commercialize products and dose forms for which we may obtain regulatory approval  maintaining expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio  hiring additional clinical manufacturing and scientific personnel or contractors and  adding operational financial and management information systems and human resources support including additional personnel to support our vaccine development in addition we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses as a public company which subjects us to the reporting requirements of the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act and the rules and regulations of the nasdaq capital market in  we raised  million in equity and  million in debt financing to support our scibvactm cmv and gbm vaccine program to continue the advancement of our research programs and for other general corporate purposes based upon our current cash position and by monitoring our discretionary expenditures as well as the careful management of our clinical trial commitments and operating costs we believe these proceeds will be sufficient to fund our activities including our approved capital expenditure requirements into  we expect however that we will need to secure additional financing in the future to carry out all of our planned clinical regulatory rd sales and manufacturing activities with respect to the advancement of our scibvactm and new vaccine candidates since inception vbi and its subsidiaries collectively have raised approximately  million in total equity and debt financing to support clinical and research development and general business operations rd services pursuant to an agreement with the office of the chief scientist in israel the company is required to make services available for the biotechnology industry in israel these services include relevant activities for development and manufacturing of therapeutic proteins according to international standards and cgmp quality level suitable for toxicological studies in animals and clinical studies phase i  ii in humans service activities include analyticsbio analytics methods for development and process development of therapeutic proteins starting with a lead candidate clone through the upstream purification formulation and filling processes and manufacturing for phase i  ii clinical trials these rd services are primarily marketed to the israeli research community in academia and israeli biotechnology companies in the life sciences lacking the infrastructure or experience in the development and production of therapeutic proteins in the standards and quality required for clinical trials for human use in  and  the company provided services to more than  biotech companies including analytical development upstream development process protein purification and formulation and filling for phase i clinical studies vbi cda also provides some rd services pursuant to a research agreement and certain governmental research and development grants financial overview overall performance the company had net losses of approximately  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively the company has an accumulated deficit of  as december   the company had  of cash at december   and net working capital of approximately  research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our cmv vaccine which include  the cost of acquiring developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials and other consumables and lab supplies used in our preclinical studies  expenses incurred under agreements with contractors or contract manufacturing organizations to advance the cmv vaccine into clinical trials and  employeerelated expenses including salaries benefits travel and stockbased compensation expense we expense research and development costs when we incur them general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for executive and other administrative

accounting services travel and conference fees including board and scientific advisory board meeting costs rent maintenance of facilities depreciation office supplies and expenses insurance and other general expenses general and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of adding employees and scaling our operations commensurate with advancing a clinical candidate and continuing to support a public company infrastructure these increases will likely include increased costs for insurance hiring of additional personnel board committees outside consultants investor relations lawyers and accountants among other expenses interest income interest income consists principally of interest income earned on cash balances and on rd tax refunds interest expense interest expense is associated with our previously outstanding convertible notes and the credit facility entered into on july

revenue for the year ended december   was  as compared to  for the year ended december   the revenue decreased by  or  largely as a result of the partial shutdown of production during the first quarter of  for maintenance and construction as well as the subsequent slower rampup of revenues and the reduction of the number of larger service contacts in  compared to  these reductions were

two large service projects cost of revenues cost of revenues for the year ended december   was  as compared to  for the year ended december   the decrease in the cost of revenues of  or  was a result of a decrease of production activities as a result of a partial shutdown of the manufacturing facility for maintenance and upgrades during the first half of  which was offset by a provision of approximately  for inventory which largely related to some excess raw materials in inventory which are no longer expected to be used in the manufacturing process research and development research and development rd expenses for the year ended december   were  as compared to  for the year ended december   during the year ended december   the company incurred  in costs related to the acquisition of dnase technology this onetime cost was not repeated during the year ended december   during the year ended december   the decrease in the cost of rd due to the nonrecurrence of the technology acquisition was largely offset by the rd expenses incurred by vbi de since the vbiscivac merger in the amount of  million these costs included fees paid to cros and other contractors in support of the trials as well as rd salaries contractors consumables license and patent related fees and well as a  sharebased compensation expense related to the issuance of options and restricted shares general

the vbiscivac merger there was sharebased compensation expense of  related to the issuance of options and restricted shares compared to  for the year ended december   related to advisory services received in connection with the levon merger in addition during  there were additional professional and transaction related costs incurred by the company related to the vbiscivac merger which were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of professional and transaction fees arising from the levon merger that closed july   net loss from operations the net loss from operations for the year ended december   was  as compared to  for the year ended december   the  increase in the net loss from operations resulted from the increased rd and ga costs resulting from the vbiscivac merger largely offset by the nonrecurrence of  in costs related to the dnase technology that were incurred during the year ended december   discussed above interest expense net the interest expense decrease of  is a result of the deemed interest of certain previously outstanding related party loans that were held in scivac prior to the levon merger these loans and capital notes were exchanged for common shares of the company as part of the levon merger this decrease was partially offset by  of interest recorded in  related to the longterm loan in  the interest expense relates to the interest on the debt facility that was assumed upon the vbiscivac merger and the interest on the debt facility received in december  the interest paid on longterm debt during the yearended december   and  was  and  respectively the company also accreted  of noncash interest expense related to the debt discount during  foreign exchange loss gain the foreign exchange gain of  as compared to a foreign exchange loss

loss the net loss decreased by  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december   the decrease in our net loss is mainly attributable to the decrease in our loss from operations and the increase in the income tax benefit discussed above liquidity and capital resources december   december    change  change   cash         current assets      current liabilities

of  at december   working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets we expect that we will need to secure additional financing in the future to carry out all of our planned clinical regulatory rd sales and manufacturing activities with respect to the advancement of our scibvactm and new vaccine candidates we base this belief on assumptions that are subject to change and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect the company expects a need to raise additional funds in order to continue its ongoing development programs the additional funds may be in the form of additional debt equity or a combination of both and may require that additional warrants be issued the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to do so the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern on june   the company closed an equity private placement under the terms of the financing the company sold an aggregate of  of its common shares at a price of approximately  per share for total gross proceeds of approximately  million as previously disclosed the company has and will continue to use the proceeds from the private placement for working capital and general corporate purposes including the continued development of its growing vaccine pipeline the securities sold in the private placement have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended and may not be resold absent registration under or exemption from such act contemporaneously with the december  transaction discussed below an additional  common shares were issued pursuant to an antidilution provision included in the share purchase agreement on december   we raised  million in an equity financing transaction with perceptive life sciences master fund ltd and titanperc ltd under the terms of the equity financing we sold an aggregate of  of our common shares at a price of  per share for total gross proceeds of approximately  million in a concurrent debt financing transaction with perceptive credit holdings lp perceptive credit we raised an additional  million net of  in deferring financing charges additionally perceptive credit increased its current credit agreement with us by funding an additional  million in secured debt in conjunction with the additional debt funding we issued a year warrant to perceptive credit for the purchase of an aggregate of  common shares up to  of the common shares underlying the warrant may be exercised at a price of  per share and up to  of the common shares underlying the warrant may be exercised at a price of  per share we have and will continue to use the proceeds of the private placement for working capital and general corporate purposes including the continued development of our growing vaccine pipeline our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the progress and results of our clinical trials the duration and cost of discovery and preclinical development laboratory testing and clinical trials for our products the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our products product sales outside of israel the costs involved in preparing filing prosecuting maintaining defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue and the costs of commercialization activities including product marketing sales and distribution the company will require significant additional funds to conduct clinical and nonclinical trials achieve regulatory approvals and subject to such approvals commercially launch its products if adequate funds are not available in order to continue operations the company may be required to delay reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently we may need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements although we are pursuing different opportunities other than as disclosed in this report we currently do not have any signed commitments for future external funding we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate we may also decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable the sale of additional equity or debt securities will likely result in dilution to our shareholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations
