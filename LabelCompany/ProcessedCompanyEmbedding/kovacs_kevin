to ask a remodeler contractor do you work with subcontractors the question is great for some industries and nonapplicable for others a general contractor for example will by definition employ subcontractors most orange additions and remodels companies do not but there are exceptions you should always ask this question to your service providers if they do use subcontractors ask if theyre all licensed and insured independently do you have any references that i can contact always ask for references and always check them keep in mind though that the only references youll get are people who the contractor is certain will give him a good review youd also be well advised to check online review sources in orange as well which will give you a broader view of customer satisfaction for a given company what guarantees andor warranties can you give me are you a warranty agent for any brands these first two questions should only relate to services or good purchased directly from the service provider many products carry their own warranties like roofing shingles or siding its useful to know what these warranties cover as well as how long they last the warranty agent question is important because often warranty agents work with the manufacturer to get you repairs under warranty at a much lower price how many contractors do you have working for you how many vehicles are in your fleet this is important mostly for larger jobs clearly a two man operation is going to build a home much slower than a  man crew this is also a good indication of the overall size of the additions and remodels company if thats an area of concern for you the reason you may want to ask about the fleet is that fleet size is a good indicator of the mobility of the company mobility may not sound important but its hard for the orange contractors to get to job sites if they lack appropriate vehicles let us find additions and remodels professionals for you request online ac companies ac
