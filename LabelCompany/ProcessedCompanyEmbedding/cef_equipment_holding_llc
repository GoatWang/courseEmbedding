was granted a banking license by the belgian banking and finance commission in  authorizing it to carry out banking activities on a global basis it took over operation of euroclear from the brussels belgium office of morgan guaranty trust company of new york on december         securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the euroclear operator are governed by the terms and conditions

omnibus positions on behalf of their respective participants through customers securities accounts in clearstreams and euroclears names on the books of their respective depositaries which in turn will hold positions in customers securities accounts in the depositaries names on the books of dtc       transfers between dtcs participants will occur in accordance with dtc rules transfers between clearstreams participants and euroclears participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with their applicable rules and operating procedures          crossmarket transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through dtc on the one hand and directly or indirectly through clearstream participants or euroclear participants on the other will be effected in dtc in accordance with dtc rules on behalf of the relevant european international clearing system by its depositary however such crossmarket transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant european international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines european time the relevant european

securityholders will not receive written confirmation from dtc of their purchase but securityholders are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction as well as periodic statements of their holdings from the dtc participant or indirect participant through which the securityholder entered into the transaction transfers of ownership interests in the securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of dtc participants acting on behalf of securityholders securityholders will not receive certificates representing their ownership interest in securities unless the bookentry system for the securities is discontinued because of this unless and until definitive securities for such series are issued securityholders will not be recognized by the applicable indenture trustee or trustee or managing member as applicable as noteholders certificateholders or securityholders as the case may be hence unless and until definitive securities are issued securityholders will only be able to exercise their rights as securityholders indirectly through dtc and its participating organizations       to facilitate subsequent transfers all securities deposited by dtc participants with dtc are registered in the name of dtcs nominee the deposit of securities with dtc and their registration in the name of its nominee effects no change in beneficial ownership dtc has no knowledge of the actual securityholders of the securities its records reflect only the issuer of the dtc participants to whose accounts such securities are credited which may or may not be the securityholders the dtc participants are responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers       notices and other communications conveyed by dtc to dtc participants by dtc participants to indirect participants and by dtc participants and indirect participants to securityholders are governed by arrangements among them and any statutory or regulatory requirements that are in effect from time to time       neither dtc nor its nominee will consent or vote with respect to securities under its usual procedures dtc mails an omnibus proxy to the issuer as soon as possible after the record date which assigns its nominees consenting or voting rights to those dtc participants to whose accounts the securities are credited on the record date identified in a listing attached thereto       principal and interest payments on securities cleared through dtc will be made to dtc dtcs practice is to credit participants accounts on the applicable payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on dtcs records unless dtc has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on the payment    date payments by dtc participants to securityholders will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in street name and will be the responsibility of the dtc participant and not of dtc the indenture trustee or the issuer subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements that are in effect from time to time payment of principal and interest to dtc is the responsibility of the indenture trustee disbursement of those payments to dtc participants is the responsibility of dtc and disbursement of the payments to securityholders is the responsibility of dtc participants and indirect participants       principal and interest payments on securities held through clearstream or euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of clearstream participants or euroclear participants in accordance with the relevant systems rules and procedures to the extent received by its depositary those payments will be subject to tax reporting in accordance with relevant united states tax laws and regulations as described below in us federal income tax consequences clearstream or the euroclear operator as the case may be will take any other action permitted to be taken by a securityholder under a related agreement on behalf of a clearstream participant or euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures and subject to its depositarys ability to effect such actions on its behalf through dtc       although dtc clearstream and euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of securities among participants of dtc clearstream and euroclear they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and such procedures may be discontinued at any time       we obtained the information in this section concerning dtc clearstream and euroclear and their respective bookentry systems from sources that we believe to be reliable but we take no responsibility for its accuracy definitive securities       notes or certificates that are initially cleared through dtc will be issued in definitive fully registered certificated form to investors or their respective nominees rather than to dtc or its nominee only if     the administrator for any issuer advises the related indenture trustee or the related trustee or managing member as applicable in writing that dtc is no longer willing or able to discharge properly its responsibilities as depository with respect to such securities and the administrator is unable to locate a qualified successor       the administrator for any issuer at its option advises the indenture trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the bookentry system through dtc or       after the occurrence of an event of default or a servicer default with respect to a series of securities securityholders representing at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the notes or the certificates as the case may be in that series advise the applicable trustee or managing member as applicable through dtc in writing that the continuation of a bookentry system through dtc or a successor thereto with respect to the notes or certificates is no longer in the best interest of their holders       if any of these events occur the applicable indenture trustee will be required to notify all holders of the securities in the affected series through clearing organization participants of the availability of definitive securities

permitted to remit collections once a month the issuer will be permitted to make that deposit net of distributions to be made to the servicer with respect to the same calendar month servicing compensation       with respect to each issuer the servicer will be entitled to receive a servicing fee for each calendar month in an amount equal to a percentage per annum specified in the related prospectus supplement of the aggregate loan value of the issuers receivables as of the first day of the applicable calendar month the servicing fee will be paid solely from the sources and at the priority specified in the related prospectus supplement including but not limited to late fees prepayment charges modification fees and other ancillary amounts any fees agreed to between the servicer and the subservicer shall be paid solely by the servicer servicing advances       the servicer may but shall have no obligation to make a servicer advance in the manner and to the extent provided in the servicing agreement but only to the extent the servicer in its sole discretion expects to be reimbursed for such advance if the servicer elects to make a servicer advance prior to the close of business on each determination date the servicer will determine the amount of the advance that it has elected to make on the related transfer date the servicer shall include information as to such determination in the servicers certificate furnished by it and will transfer to the collection account on the transfer date in next day funds the amounts applicable to such determinations appearing in such servicers certificate the servicer shall be reimbursed for outstanding servicer advances as provided in your prospectus supplement and interest will accrue on such advance as provided in your prospectus supplement evidence as to compliance       each servicing agreement will require that a firm of independent public accountants furnish to the issuer and indenture trustee annually a statement as to compliance by the servicer during the preceding twelve months or in the case of the first such certificate from the applicable closing date with specified standards relating to the servicing of the applicable receivables the servicers accounting records and computer files and certain other matters       each servicing agreement will also require that an officer of the servicer deliver to the related issuer substantially simultaneously with the delivery of the accountants statement a certificate stating that the servicer has fulfilled its obligations under the servicing agreement throughout the preceding twelve months or in the case of the first such certificate from the closing date or if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation describing each such default the indenture will require the issuer to deliver a copy of such accountants statement to the indenture trustee          securityholders may obtain copies of such statements and certificates by written request addressed to the owner trustee or managing member as applicable appointment of subservicers       the servicer may at any time appoint a subservicer to perform all or any portion of its obligations as servicer the servicer shall remain obligated and be liable to the issuer for the servicing of the receivables in accordance with the applicable servicing agreement without diminution of those obligations and liabilities by virtue of the appointment of any subservicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the servicer itself were servicing and administering the receivables the fees and expenses of each subservicer shall be as agreed between the servicer and its subservicer from time to time and the issuer shall not have any responsibility therefor resignation liability and successors of the servicer       the servicer will not be permitted to resign from its obligations and duties as servicer for any issuer except as provided under the relevant servicing agreement no resignation will become effective until a successor servicer has assumed such servicers servicing obligations and duties       neither the servicer nor any of its directors officers employees and agents will be under any liability to any issuer for taking any action or for refraining from taking any action under the applicable servicing agreement or for errors in judgment however the servicer will not be protected against any liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith or negligence in the performance of the servicers duties thereunder or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties thereunder in addition the servicer will not be under any obligation to appear in prosecute or defend any legal action that is not incidental to the servicers servicing responsibilities under the related servicing agreement and that in its opinion may cause it to incur any expense or liability       upon compliance with procedural requirements specified in the related servicing agreement any of the following will be the successor of the servicer under that servicing agreement     any entity into which the servicer may be merged or consolidated or any entity resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the servicer is a party       any entity succeeding to the business of the servicer or       any corporation  or more of the voting stock of which is owned directly or indirectly by general electric capital services inc which assumes the obligations of the servicer servicer default       the following events will constitute servicer defaults under each servicing agreement unless otherwise provided in your prospectus supplement     the servicer fails to make required deposits or to direct the indenture trustee to make required distributions subject to a three business day cure period after discovery or notice       the servicer breaches its obligations under the servicing agreement subject to materiality limitations and a  day cure period after notice and       bankruptcy or insolvency of the servicer rights upon servicer default       if a default under a servicing agreement occurs and remains unremedied with respect to a servicer default the indenture provides that the related issuer will promptly exercise its rights to terminate the servicer with respect to certain servicer defaults set forth in your prospectus supplement and if any other servicer default occurs under the servicing agreement prior to terminating the servicer the indenture requires the issuer to obtain the consent of holders of notes of the related series evidencing at least  in outstanding    principal amount of such notes or of one or more particular classes of such notes if specified in the related prospectus supplement in that event a successor servicer appointed by the issuer will succeed to all the responsibilities duties and liabilities of the servicer under the servicing agreement and will be entitled to similar compensation arrangements       if a successor servicer has not been appointed and accepted its appointment at the time when the servicer ceases to act as servicer the indenture trustee will automatically be appointed as the successor servicer if the indenture trustee is unwilling or unable to act as successor servicer it may resign after which the issuer will appoint a successor with a net worth of at least  and whose regular business includes the servicing of aircraft or aircraft related equipment receivables waiver of past defaults       with respect to each issuer unless otherwise provided in the related prospectus supplement such issuer may upon obtaining the consent of the holders of notes of such series evidencing at least  in outstanding principal amount of such notes waive any default by the servicer in the performance of its obligations under the related servicing agreement and its consequences except a default in making any required deposits to or payments from any of the trust accounts therefore the issuer with the consent of the requisite noteholders has the ability to waive defaults by the servicer which could materially adversely affect the certificateholders none of these waivers will impair the issuers rights with respect to subsequent defaults amendment       unless otherwise provided in the related prospectus supplement each of an issuers transaction agreements may be amended by the parties to the agreement without the consent of the related noteholders or certificateholders upon prior written notice to the rating agencies in addition unless otherwise provided in the related prospectus supplement each of an issuers transaction agreements may be amended by the parties to the agreement without the consent of the related noteholders or certificateholders to substitute or add credit enhancement for any class of securities so long as the applicable rating agencies confirm in writing that such substitution or addition will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the rating of any class of securities in the related series       unless otherwise specified in the related prospectus supplement each of an issuers transaction agreements may be amended by the parties to the agreement with the consent of the indenture trustee the holders of notes evidencing at least a majority in principal amount of then outstanding notes of the related series and the holders of certificates of such series evidencing at least a majority of the invested amount of the certificates however no such amendment may a increase or reduce in any manner the amount of or accelerate or delay the timing of collections of payments on the related receivables or distributions that are required to be made for the benefit of such noteholders or certificateholders or b reduce the required percentage of the notes or certificates that are required to consent to any such amendment without the consent of the holders of all the outstanding notes or certificates as the case may be of such series termination       with respect to each issuer our obligations and the obligations of the servicer the related owner trustee or managing member as applicable and the related indenture trustee pursuant to the issuers transaction agreements will terminate upon a the maturity or other liquidation of the last related receivables and the disposition of any amounts received upon liquidation of any such remaining receivables and b the payment to noteholders and certificateholders of the related series of all amounts required to be paid to them pursuant to the transaction agreements the servicer will provide notice of any termination of such obligations to the owner trustee or managing member as applicable following receipt of notice from the servicer the owner trustee or managing member as applicable will mail notice of such termination to the certificateholders the issuer will mail notice of any such termination to the indenture trustee and the noteholders    administration agreement       ge capital or any other finance company will enter into an administration agreement with each issuer under which such finance company will act as administrator for the issuer the administrator will perform on behalf of the issuer administrative obligations required by the related indenture swap agreements       if specified in your prospectus supplement the related issuer will on or prior to closing date enter into one or more swap agreements with one or more swap counterparties for purposes of managing the issuers interest rate risk exposure relating to differences in the basis upon which interest accrues on the aircraft loans and the basis upon which interest accrues on the notes and distributions on the invested amount which are made on any certificates credit and cash flow enhancement       we will describe the amounts and types of credit enhancement arrangements and the provider of the credit enhancements if applicable with respect to each class of securities of a given series in the related prospectus supplement credit enhancement may be in the form of subordination of one or more classes of securities spread accounts overcollateralization demand notes letters of credit credit or liquidity facilities surety bonds guaranteed investment contracts swaps or other interest rate protection agreements repurchase obligations other agreements with respect to third party payments or other support cash deposits or such other arrangements as may be described in the related prospectus supplement or any combination of two or more of the foregoing credit enhancement for a class of securities may cover one or more other classes of securities of the same series and credit enhancement for a series of securities may cover one or more other series of securities any credit enhancement that constitutes a guarantee of the applicable securities will be separately registered under the securities act unless exempt from such registration       the presence of a spread account and other forms of credit enhancement for the benefit of any class or series of securities is intended to enhance the likelihood of receipt by the securityholders of the full amount of payments on the notes or distributions in respect of certificates and to decrease the likelihood that the securityholders will experience losses the credit enhancement for a class or series of securities generally will not provide protection against all risks of loss and will not guarantee repayment of the entire principal balance with interest on the notes or all distributions on certificate invested amounts and distributions of certificate invested amounts if losses occur which exceed the amount covered by any credit enhancement or which are not covered by any credit enhancement securityholders of any class or series will bear their allocable share of deficiencies as described in the related prospectus supplement in addition if a form of credit enhancement covers more than one class or series of securities securityholders of any one class or series will be subject to the risk that the credit enhancement will be exhausted by the claims of securityholders of other classes or series       the issuer may replace the credit enhancement for any class of securities with another form of credit enhancement without the consent of securityholders if the applicable rating agencies confirm in writing that the substitution will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of their rating of any class of securities of the related series       spread account if so provided in the related prospectus supplement the issuer will establish for a series or class of securities a spread account the issuer may initially fund any spread account by a deposit on the applicable closing date in an amount set forth in the related prospectus supplement as further described in the related prospectus supplement the amount on deposit in the spread account may be increased on each payment date up to a balance specified in the related prospectus supplement by the deposit of collections on the related receivables remaining after all higher priority payments on that payment date we will describe in the related prospectus supplement the circumstances and manner under which distributions may be made out of the spread account to holders of securities to the issuer or to any of the issuers transferees or assignees          to the extent permitted by the applicable rating agencies funds in an issuer spread account may be invested in securities that will not mature prior to the next payment date as a result the amount of cash in a spread account at any time may be less than the balance of the spread account if the amount required to be withdrawn from any spread account to cover shortfalls in collections on the related receivables as provided in the related prospectus supplement exceeds the amount of cash in the spread account a temporary shortfall in the amounts paid or distributed to the related noteholders or certificateholders could result which could in turn increase the average life of the related securities       the issuer may at any time without consent of the securityholders sell or otherwise transfer its rights to any spread account if a the applicable rating agencies confirm in writing that doing so will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the rating of any class of securities b the issuer provides to the owner trustee or managing member as applicable and the indenture trustee a written opinion from independent counsel to the effect that the transfer will not cause the issuer to be treated as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes and c the transferee or assignee agrees in writing to take positions for tax purposes consistent with the tax positions agreed to be taken by the issuer legal aspects of the receivables bankruptcy considerations relating to the finance companies       we and the finance companies will take steps in structuring the transactions described in this prospectus that are intended to ensure that the voluntary or involuntary application for relief by any of the finance companies under the united states bankruptcy code or other insolvency laws will not result in consolidation of our assets and liabilities or the assets and liabilities of the issuer with those of ge capital or any other finance company these steps include the creation of the issuer as a separate limitedpurpose subsidiary pursuant to an operating agreement or trust agreement containing restrictions on the nature of the issuers business our operating agreement also contains such restrictions as well as a restriction on our ability to commence a voluntary case or proceeding under any insolvency law without the unanimous affirmative vote of all our directors however there can be no assurance that our activities would not result in a court concluding that our assets and liabilities or the issuers assets and liabilities should be consolidated with those of ge capital or any other finance company in a proceeding under any insolvency law       each finance company that sells receivables to us will warrant that each sale of receivables by it to us is a valid sale if a finance company were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case and a creditor or trusteeinbankruptcy or the debtor itself were to take the position that either or both of the transfers of receivables should instead be treated as a pledge of receivables to secure a borrowing then delays in payments of collections of receivables to the issuer and in payments on the notes and distributions on the certificates could occur if the court ruled in favor of the creditor owner trustee or managing member as applicable or a finance company reductions in the amount of such payments could result       if any transfer of receivables referred to above or any of our transfers of receivables to the issuer were treated as a pledge instead of a sale a tax or government lien on the property of the transferor arising before the sale of the receivable may have priority over the issuers interest in the receivable if those transfers are treated as sales the receivables would not be part of the transferors bankruptcy estate and would not be available to the transferors creditors except under limited circumstances in addition cash collections on the receivables may under some circumstances be commingled with the funds of the servicer and in the event of the bankruptcy of the servicer an issuer may not have a perfected interest in those collections perfection and priority with respect to receivables       a purchaser of aircraft loans who gives new value and takes possession of the chattel paper or obtains control of the chattel paper that evidences the aircraft loans in good faith in the ordinary course of the purchasers business and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of an issuer as secured party may have priority over the interest of the related issuer in the aircraft loans any sale by a finance company    of aircraft loans that had been sold to an issuer would be a violation of the finance companies contractual obligations security interests in financed equipment       in some states receivables like the ones that may be included in your issuer evidence the credit sale of aircraft and aircraft related equipment in those states the receivables also constitute personal property security agreements and include grants of security interests in the aircraft or aircraft related receivables under the applicable uniform commercial code perfection of security interests in aircraft related equipment such as engines propellers or spares is generally governed by the uniform commercial code however perfection of security interests in aircraft registered in the united states of america is governed by title  of the united states code  usc§§       each of the finance companies takes appropriate action under the laws of each state in which the obligor is located to perfect its security interest in the aircraft with respect to the aircraft related equipment that may be perfected by the filing of financing statements under the applicable uniform commercial code each of the finance companies will make the appropriate filings with the federal aviation administration in the case of the aircraft       although recordation with the federal aviation administration serves to notify third parties of conveyances and security interests state law governs other legal issues compliance with recordation requirements does not validate a contract which is otherwise lacking in validity such as a mortgage or conveyance obtained by fraud or without consideration or executed by an incompetent party in addition the validity of title documents affecting aircraft actual notice good faith purchaser status and similar issues is determined by state rather than federal law       although federal recordation is required to perfect a security interest before that security interest can obtain priority state law determines the order of such priorities for example section a of revised article  of the uniform commercial code governs whether the holder of a duly perfected security interest in an aircraft takes priority over a lien creditor with respect to such aircraft whereas proper federal recordation merely enables such holder to perfect its security interest       as liquidated damages upon request of the issuer we are required to purchase from each issuer any aircraft loan as to which necessary perfection actions have not been taken prior to the time of sale to the issuer if the failure to take those actions will materially adversely affect the interest of the issuer in the receivable and the failure is not cured within a specified grace period similarly upon our request each finance company that sells receivables to us is required to purchase any such receivable if the failure occurred prior to its transfer of the receivable to us in addition the servicer is required to take appropriate steps to maintain perfection of security interests in the financed equipment       in addition under the laws of most states liens for repairs performed on the aircraft and liens for unpaid taxes take priority over even a perfected security interest in equipment we will represent to each issuer that as of the date the related receivable is sold to such issuer each security interest in financed aircraft or aircraft related equipment is or will be prior to all other present liens on and security interests in the financed equipment however liens and other charges giving rise to similar rights of detention are likely to arise in the normal course of operation of an aircraft for items such as airport taxes customs duties storage air navigation charges landing charges fuel crew wages repairers charges or salvage also error fraud or forgery by the aircraft owner or the servicer or administrative error by state or local agencies could impair an issuers security interest neither we nor the servicer must repurchase a receivable if any of the occurrences described above other than any action by the servicer result in the issuers losing the priority of its security interest or its security interest in the financed aircraft or aircraft related equipment after the date the security interest was assigned to the issuer    security interests in leased equipment       when we sell leases to an issuer we also assign to the issuer any security or ownership interest that we hold in the leased equipment each lease will be a lease intended for security often referred to as a finance lease rather than a true lease true lease  the lessor  ie  the originating dealer and its assigns is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the leased equipment finance lease not a true lease  the lessee is deemed to be the beneficial owner and the lessor or its assignee is deemed to hold a security interest in the leased equipment       all leases that will be transferred to an issuer will have either bargain purchase options or be conditional sale contracts which under applicable state law standards should be deemed to be finance leases each of the finance companies will obtain a first priority perfected security interest in the leased equipment as a result of these actions for the finance leases the applicable finance company and its assigns will have a very similar position to the one described above with respect to loans and the same repurchase obligations apply if there is no first priority perfected security interest       in the event that a finance company were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case a bankruptcy trustee might attempt to characterize the finance leases as true leases and if successful would have the ability to reject such leases resulting in cancellation of the remaining scheduled payments under the leases       state laws differ as to whether anyone suffering injury to person or property involving leased aircraft or other related aircraft equipment may bring an action upon which relief may be granted against the owner of the aircraft or aircraft related equipment by virtue of that ownership to the extent the leases are deemed to be true leases and the issuer is deemed to be the owner of such equipment the applicable state law may permit such an action and if such action is successful the related issuer and its assets may be subject to liability to the injured party if vicarious liability were imposed on an issuer as owner of leased equipment and the coverage provided by any available insurance is insufficient to cover the loss you could incur a loss on your investment       title  of the united states code provides for a statutory limitation of liability for owners lessors and secured parties of aircraft who are not in the actual possession or control of such aircraft       under title  of the united states code a lessor owner or secured party is liable for personal injury death or property loss or damage only when a civil aircraft aircraft engine or propeller is in the actual possession or control of the lessor owner or secured party and the personal injury death or property loss or damage occurs because of  the aircraft engine or propeller or  the flight of or an object falling from the aircraft engine or propeller       although neither we nor the issuer operate or control any aircraft both the issuer and ourselves may be named as a defendant in a lawsuit resulting from any incident involving an obligors aircraft and be required to bear any consequences costs and expenses repossession       upon a default by an aircraft or aircraft related equipment purchaser the holder of an aircraft loan that is treated as a personal property security interest has all the remedies of a secured party under the uniform commercial code except where specifically limited by other state laws under those remedies the secured party may perform selfhelp repossession unless it would constitute a breach of the peace selfhelp is accomplished simply by retaking possession of the financed or leased equipment some jurisdictions require that the obligor be notified of the default and be given time to cure the default prior to repossession generally the right of reinstatement may be exercised on a limited number of occasions in any oneyear period in cases where the obligor objects or raises a defense to repossession or if otherwise required by applicable state law a court order must be obtained from the appropriate state court and the aircraft or aircraft related equipment must then be repossessed in accordance with that order although self help is an available remedy it is rarely used in most cases a notice of default is sent to the obligor and legal counsel is instructed to commence legal proceedings to recover the equipment    notice of sale redemption rights       the uniform commercial code and other state laws require a secured party to provide an obligor with reasonable notice of the date time and place of any public sale andor the date after which any private sale of collateral may be held the obligor has the right to redeem the collateral prior to actual sale by paying the secured party the unpaid principal balance of the obligation plus reasonable expenses for repossessing holding and preparing the collateral for disposition and arranging for its sale plus in some jurisdictions reasonable attorneys fees or in some states by payment of delinquent installments or the unpaid balance uniform commercial code considerations       many states have adopted a version of article a of the uniform commercial code that purports to codify many provisions of existing common law although there is little precedent regarding how article a will be interpreted it may among other things limit the enforceability of any unconscionable lease or unconscionable provision in a lease provide a lessee with remedies including the right to cancel the lease for certain lessor breaches or defaults and leases where the lessee is a merchant lessee however each finance company that sells a lease will represent that to the best of their knowledge each lessee has accepted the aircraft or aircraft related equipmentleased to it and after reasonable opportunity to inspect and test has not notified the applicable finance company of any defects article a does however recognize typical commercial lease hell or high water rental payment clauses and validates reasonable liquidated damages provisions in the event of lessor or lessee defaults article a also recognizes the concept of freedom of contract and permits the parties in a commercial context a wide degree of latitude to vary provisions of the law deficiency judgments and excess proceeds other limitations       the proceeds of resale of aircraft or aircraft related equipment generally will be applied first to the expenses of resale and repossession and then to the satisfaction of the indebtedness some states impose prohibitions or limitations on deficiency judgments if the net proceeds from resale do not cover the full amount of the indebtedness in other states a deficiency judgment against the debtor can be sought for the shortfall however because a defaulting obligor may have very little capital or sources of income available following repossession in many cases it may not be useful to seek a deficiency judgment if one is obtained it may be uncollectible or settled at a significant discount       occasionally after resale of the aircraft or aircraft related equipment and payment of all expenses and all indebtedness there is a surplus of funds in that case the uniform commercial code requires the creditor to remit the surplus to any holder of a lien on the aircraft or aircraft related equipment or if no such lienholder exists to the former owner of the equipment       courts have applied general equitable principles to secured parties pursuing repossession and litigation involving deficiency balances these equitable principles may have the effect of relieving an obligor from some or all of the legal consequences of a default       in several cases obligors have asserted that the selfhelp remedies of secured parties under the uniform commercial code and related laws violate the due process protections provided under the th amendment to the constitution of the united states courts have generally upheld the notice provisions of the uniform commercial code and related laws as reasonable or have found that the repossession and resale by the creditor do not involve sufficient state action to afford constitutional protection to borrowers as to leases some jurisdictions require that a lessee be notified of a default and given a time period within which to cure the default prior to repossession of leased equipment       in addition to the laws limiting or prohibiting deficiency judgments numerous other statutory provisions including federal bankruptcy laws and related state laws may interfere with or affect the ability of a secured party to realize upon collateral or to enforce a deficiency judgment for example in a chapter   or  proceeding under the federal bankruptcy law a court may prevent a creditor from repossessing equipment and as part of the rehabilitation plan reduce the amount of the secured indebtedness to the market value of    the aircraft or aircraft related equipment at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the court leaving the creditor as a general unsecured creditor for the remainder of the indebtedness a bankruptcy court may also reduce the monthly payments due under a contract or change the rate of interest and time of repayment of the indebtedness us federal income tax consequences       the following is a summary of the material us federal income tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the notes and certificates this summary is based upon current provisions of the internal revenue code of  called the code  proposed temporary and final treasury regulations thereunder and published rulings and court decisions currently in effect the current tax laws and the current regulations rulings and court decisions may be changed possibly retroactively the portions of this summary which relate to matters of law or legal conclusions represent the opinion of mayer brown rowe  maw special federal tax counsel for each issuer as qualified in this summary mayer brown rowe  maw have prepared or reviewed the statements in this prospectus under the heading us federal income tax consequences and are of the opinion that they are correct in all material respects       the following summary does not furnish information in the level of detail or with the attention to an investors specific tax circumstances that would be provided by an investors own tax advisor for example it does not discuss the tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the notes and certificates by investors that are subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws including banks and thrifts insurance companies regulated investment companies dealers in securities holders that will hold the notes or certificates as a position in a straddle for tax purposes or as a part of a synthetic security or conversion transaction or other integrated investment comprised of the notes or certificates and one or more other investments trusts and estates and passthrough issuers the equity holders of which are any of these specified investors in addition the discussion regarding the notes and certificates is limited to the federal income tax consequences of the initial investors and not a purchaser in the secondary market and to investors who have purchased notes and who hold those notes as capital assets within the meaning of section  of the code       each issuer will be provided with an opinion of mayer brown rowe  maw regarding certain federal income tax matters discussed below an opinion of mayer brown rowe  maw however is not binding on the internal revenue service called the irs or the courts moreover there are no cases or irs rulings on similar transactions involving both debt and equity interests issued by an issuer with terms similar to those of the notes and the certificates as a result the irs may disagree with all or a part of the discussion below no ruling on any of the issues discussed below will be sought from the irs for purposes of the following summary references to the issuer the notes the certificates and related terms parties and documents refer unless otherwise specified to each issuer and the notes certificates and related terms parties and documents applicable to that issuer tax characterization of the issuer       mayer brown rowe  maw is of the opinion that the issuer will not be an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes this opinion is based on the assumption of compliance by all parties with the terms of the issuer agreement and related documents       if the issuer were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes the issuer would be subject to corporate income tax on its taxable income the issuers taxable income would include all its income on the receivables possibly reduced by its interest expense on the notes any corporate income tax imposed on the issuer could materially reduce cash available to make payments on the notes and distributions on the certificates and certificateholders could be liable for any tax that is unpaid by the issuer    tax consequences to holders of the notes       treatment of the notes as indebtedness the issuer will agree and if you purchase notes you will agree by your purchase of the notes to treat the notes as debt for federal state and local income and franchise tax purposes mayer brown rowe  maw is of the opinion that the notes will be classified as debt for federal income tax purposes the discussion below assumes the notes are classified as debt for federal income tax purposes       oid indexed securities etc the discussion below assumes that all payments on the notes are denominated in us dollars and that the notes are not indexed securities or strip notes additionally the discussion assumes that the interest formula for the notes meets the requirements for qualified stated interest under treasury regulations called the oid regulations relating to original issue discount or oid this discussion assumes that any oid on the notes is a de minimis amount within the meaning of the oid regulations under the oid regulations the notes will have oid to the extent the principal amount of the notes exceeds their issue price further if the notes have any oid it will be de minimis if it is less than   of the principal amount of the notes multiplied by the number of full years included in their term if these conditions are not satisfied for any given series of notes and as a result the notes are treated as issued with oid additional tax considerations for these notes will be disclosed in the applicable prospectus supplement       interest income on the notes based on the above assumptions except as discussed below the notes will not be considered issued with oid if you buy notes you will be required to report as ordinary interest income the stated interest on the notes when received or accrued in accordance with your method of tax accounting under the oid regulations if you hold a note issued with a de minimis amount of oid you must include this oid in income on a pro rata basis as principal payments are made on the note if you purchase a note in the secondary market for more or less than its principal amount you will generally be subject respectively to the premium amortization or market discount rules of the code       if you have purchased a note that has a fixed maturity date of not more than one year from the issue date of the note called a shortterm note  you may be subject to special rules under the oid regulations all stated interest on a shortterm note will be treated as oid if you are an accrual basis holder of a shortterm note or a cash basis holder specified in section  of the code including regulated investment companies you will generally be required to report interest income as oid accrues on a straightline basis over the term of each interest period if you are a cash basis holder of a shortterm note other than those specified in section  you will in general be required to report interest income as interest is paid or if earlier upon the taxable disposition of the shortterm note however if you are a cash basis holder of a shortterm note reporting interest income as it is paid you may be required to defer a portion of any interest expense otherwise deductible on indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry the shortterm note this interest expense would be deferred until the taxable disposition of the shortterm note if you are a cash basis taxpayer you may elect under section  of the code to accrue interest income on all nongovernment debt obligations with a term of one year or less if you have so elected you would include oid on the shortterm note in income as it accrues but you would not be subject to the interest expense deferral rule special rules not discussed in this summary apply to a shortterm note purchased for more or less than its principal amount       sale or other disposition if you sell a note you will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and your adjusted tax basis in the note the adjusted tax basis of a note will equal your cost for the note increased by any market discount oid and gain previously included in your income with respect to the note and decreased by the amount of premium if any previously amortized and by the amount of principal payments you have previously received on the note any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss except for gain representing accrued interest and accrued market discount not previously included in income capital losses generally may be used by a corporate taxpayer only to offset capital gains and by an individual taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains plus  of other income in the case of an individual taxpayer any capital gain on the sale of a note will be taxed at the taxpayers ordinary income tax rate if the note is held for not more than  months and at a maximum rate of  if the note is held for more than  months          foreign holders if you are a nonresident alien foreign corporation or other nonunited states person called a foreign person  any interest paid to or accrued by you including oid generally will be considered

on in the united states and       i you do not actually or constructively own  or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of us or of a profits or capital interest in the issuer if characterized as a partnership       ii you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us or the issuer if treated as a partnership through stock ownership       iii you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on a note is described in section ca of the code and       iv the interest is not contingent interest described in section h of the code       to qualify for this exemption from taxation you or a financial institution holding the note on your behalf must provide in accordance with specified procedures a paying agent of the issuer with a statement to the effect that you are not a us person currently these requirements will be met if you provide your name and address and certify under penalties of perjury that you are not a us person which certification may be made on an irs form wben or if a financial institution holding the note on your behalf certifies under penalties of perjury that the required statement has been received by it and furnishes a paying agent with a copy of the statement       if you are a foreign person and interest paid or accrued to you is not portfolio interest then it will be subject to a  withholding tax unless you provide the issuer or its paying agent as the case may be with a properly executed     irs form wben claiming an exemption from withholding tax or a reduction in withholding tax under the benefit of a tax treaty or       irs form weci stating that interest paid on the note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states       if you are a foreign person engaged in a trade or business in the united states and interest on the note is effectively connected with the conduct of the trade or business although you will be exempt from the withholding tax discussed above you will be subject to united states federal income tax on your interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if you were a united states person in addition if you are a foreign corporation you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to  or lower treaty rate of your effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year subject to adjustments       if you are a foreign person any capital gain realized by you on the sale redemption retirement or other taxable disposition of a note by you will be exempt from united states federal income and withholding tax provided that     the gain is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states by you and       if you are an individual foreign person you have not been present in the united states for  days or more in the taxable year       backup withholding if you are not an exempt holder including a corporation taxexempt organization qualified pension and profitsharing issuer individual retirement account or nonresident alien who provides certification as to status as a nonresident you will be required to provide under penalties of perjury a certificate containing your name address correct federal taxpayer identification number and a statement that you are not subject to backup withholding if you are not an exempt holder and you fail to provide the required certification the issuer will be required to withhold a percentage of the amount otherwise payable to you and remit the withheld amount to the irs as a credit against your federal income tax liability pursuant to the    economic growth and tax reconciliation act of  a backup withholding rate of  is in effect for the taxable years  and  is reduced to  for the taxable years  and  and is further reduced to  for the taxable years  and thereafter under current law the backup withholding rate will be increased to  for payments made after the taxable year  information returns will be sent annually to the irs and to each note holder setting forth the amount of interest paid on the notes owned by that note holder and the amount of tax withheld on those payments       possible alternative treatments of the notes if contrary to the opinion of mayer brown rowe  maw the irs successfully asserted that one or more of the notes did not represent debt for federal income tax purposes the notes might be treated as equity interests in the issuer in this case the issuer would be treated as a partnership this partnership would not however be treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation because it would meet certain qualifying income tests nonetheless treatment of the notes as equity interests in a partnership could have adverse tax consequences to you for example if you are a foreign person income to you might be subject to us tax and us tax return filing and withholding requirements and if you are an individual holder you might be subject to certain limitations on your ability to deduct your share of issuer expenses tax consequences to holders of the certificates       the following discussion applies only to the extent certificates are offered in a related prospectus supplement until that time because the certificates will be held solely by us or one of our affiliates under current treasury regulations an issuer of certificates will be disregarded as an entity separate from us or one of our affiliates for federal income tax purposes       treatment of the issuer as a partnership we will agree and you will agree by your purchase of certificates to treat the issuer as a partnership for purposes of federal and state income tax franchise tax and any other tax measured in whole or in part by income the assets of the partnership will be the assets held by the issuer the partners of the partnership will be the certificateholders including us in our capacity as recipient of distributions from any account specified in the related prospectus supplement in which we have an interest and the notes will be debt of the partnership however the proper characterization of the arrangement involving the issuer the certificates the notes and us is not clear because there is no authority on transactions closely comparable to this arrangement       a variety of alternative characterizations are possible for example because the certificates have certain features characteristic of debt the certificates might be considered our debt or debt of the issuer this characterization should not result in materially adverse tax consequences to certificateholders compared to the consequences from treatment of the certificates as equity in a partnership described below the following discussion assumes that the certificates represent equity interests in a partnership       indexed securities etc the following discussion assumes that all payments on the certificates are denominated in us dollars none of the certificates are indexed securities or strip certificates and a series of securities includes a single class of certificates if these conditions are not satisfied with respect to any given series of certificates additional tax considerations for those certificates will be disclosed in the applicable prospectus supplement       partnership taxation as a partnership the issuer will not be subject to federal income tax rather you will be required to separately take into account your accruals of guaranteed payments from the issuer and your allocated share of other income gains losses deductions and credits of the issuer the issuers income will consist primarily of interest and finance charges earned on the receivables including appropriate adjustments as necessary for market discount oid and premium and any gain upon collection or disposition of receivables the issuers deductions will consist primarily of interest accruing on the notes guaranteed payments on the certificates servicing and other fees and losses or deductions upon collection or disposition of receivables       under the trust agreement or limited liability company agreement as applicable interest payments on the certificates including interest on amounts previously due on the certificates but not yet distributed will be    treated as guaranteed payments under section c of the code guaranteed payments are payments to partners for the use of their capital and in the present circumstances are treated as deductible to the issuer and as ordinary income to you the issuer will have a calendar year tax year and will deduct the guaranteed payments under the accrual method of accounting if you use a calendar year tax year you will be required to include the accruals of guaranteed payments in income in your taxable year that corresponds to the year in which the issuer deducts the payments if you use a taxable year other than a calendar year you will be required to include the payments in income in your taxable year that includes the december  of the calendar year in which the issuer deducts the payments it is possible that guaranteed payments will not be treated as interest for all purposes of the code       in addition the trust agreement or limited liability company agreement as applicable will provide in general that you will be allocated taxable income of the issuer for each calendar month equal to the sum of     any issuer income attributable to discount on the receivables that corresponds to any excess of the principal amount of the certificates over their initial issue price       prepayment premium if any payable to you for such month and       any other amounts of income payable to you for the month       this allocation will be reduced by any amortization by the issuer of premium on receivables corresponding to any excess of the issue price of certificates over their principal amount all remaining items of income gain loss and deduction of the issuer will be allocated to us       based upon the economic arrangement of the parties this approach for accruing guaranteed payments and allocating issuer income should be permissible under applicable treasury regulations however no assurance can be given that the irs would not require a greater amount of income to be allocated to you moreover even under the method of allocation described above you may be subject to tax on income equal to the interest rate on the certificates plus the other items described above even though the issuer might not have sufficient cash to make current cash distributions of this amount thus if you are a cash basis taxpayer you will in effect be required to report income from the certificates on the accrual basis and you may become liable for taxes on issuer income even if you have not received cash from the issuer to pay those taxes in addition because tax allocations and tax reporting will be done on a uniform basis for all certificateholders but certificateholders may be purchasing certificates at different times and at different prices you may be required to report on your tax returns taxable income that is greater or less than the amount reported to you by the issuer       most of the guaranteed payments and taxable income allocated to a certificateholder that is a pension profitsharing or employee benefit plan or other taxexempt issuer including an individual retirement account will constitute unrelated debtfinanced income generally taxable to the holder under the code       your share of expenses of the issuer including fees to the servicer but not interest expense would be miscellaneous itemized deductions these deductions might be disallowed to you in whole or in part and as a result you might be taxed on an amount of income that exceeds the amount of cash actually distributed to you over the life of the issuer it is not clear if these rules would apply to a certificateholder who accrues guaranteed payments       the issuer intends to make all tax calculations for income and allocations to certificateholders on an aggregate basis if the irs were to require that these calculations be made separately for each receivable the issuer might be required to incur additional expense but it is believed that there would not be a material adverse effect to you       discount and premium the purchase price paid by the issuer for the receivables may be greater or less than the remaining principal balance of the receivables at the time of purchase if so the receivables will have been acquired at a premium or discount respectively as indicated above the issuer will make this calculation on an aggregate basis but might be required to recompute it on a receivablebyreceivable basis          if the issuer acquires the receivables at a market discount or premium the issuer will elect to include any discount in income currently as it accrues over the life of the receivables or to offset any premium against interest income on the receivables as indicated above a portion of any market discount income or premium deduction may be allocated to you       section  termination under section  of the code the issuer will be deemed to terminate for federal income tax purposes if  or more of the capital and profits interests in the issuer are sold or exchanged within a month period under current treasury regulations if a termination occurs the issuer will be considered to have contributed the assets of the issuer constituting the old partnership to a new partnership in exchange for interests in the new partnership such interest would be deemed distributed to the partners of the old partnership in liquidation thereof the issuer will not comply with certain technical requirements that might apply if a constructive termination occurs as a result the issuer may be subject to certain tax penalties and may incur additional expenses if it is required to comply with those requirements furthermore the issuer might not be able to comply due to lack of data       disposition of certificates generally you will recognize capital gain or loss on a sale of certificates in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in the certificates sold your tax basis in a certificate will generally equal your cost for the certificate increased by your share of issuer income and accruals of guaranteed payments includible in income and decreased by any distributions received by you with respect to the certificate in addition both the tax basis in the certificates and the amount realized on a sale of a certificate would include your share of the notes and other liabilities of the issuer if you acquire certificates at different prices you may be required to maintain a single aggregate adjusted tax basis in the certificates and upon sale or other disposition of some of the certificates allocate a pro rata portion of the aggregate tax basis to the certificates sold rather than maintaining a separate tax basis in each certificate for purposes of computing gain or loss on a sale of that certificate       any gain on the sale of a certificate attributable to your share of unrecognized accrued market discount on the receivables would generally be treated as ordinary income to you and would give rise to special tax reporting requirements the issuer does not expect to have any other assets that would give rise to these special reporting requirements thus to avoid those special reporting requirements the issuer will elect to include market discount in income as it accrues       if you are required to recognize an aggregate amount of income not including income attributable to disallowed itemized deductions described above over the life of the certificates that exceeds the aggregate cash distributions paid to you on the certificates this excess will generally give rise to a capital loss upon the retirement of the certificates       allocations between transferors and transferees in general the issuers taxable income and losses will be determined monthly and the tax items and accruals of guaranteed payments for a particular calendar month will be apportioned among the certificateholders in proportion to the principal amount of certificates owned by them as of the close of the last day of the month as a result you may be allocated tax items and accruals of guaranteed payments which will affect your tax liability and tax basis attributable to periods before you purchased your certificates       the use of a monthly convention may not be permitted by existing regulations if a monthly convention is not allowed or only applies to transfers of less than all of the partners interest taxable income or losses and accruals of guaranteed payments of the issuer might be reallocated among the certificateholders we are authorized to revise the issuers method of allocation between transferors and transferees to conform to a method permitted by future treasury regulations       section  election if a certificateholder sells its certificates at a profit loss the purchasing certificateholder will have a higher lower basis in the certificates than the selling certificateholder had the tax basis of the issuers assets will not be adjusted to reflect that higher or lower basis unless the issuer were to file an election under section  of the code in order to avoid the administrative complexities that would be involved in keeping accurate accounting records as well as potentially onerous information reporting    requirements the issuer will not make this election as a result you might be allocated a greater or lesser amount of issuer income than would be appropriate based upon your own purchase price for certificates       administrative matters the trustee or managing member as applicable is required to keep or have kept complete and accurate books of the issuer these books will be maintained for financial reporting and tax purposes on an accrual basis and the fiscal year of the issuer will be the calendar year the trustee or managing member as applicable will file a partnership information return on irs form  with the irs for each taxable year of the issuer and will report each certificateholders accruals of guaranteed payments and allocable share of items of issuer income and expense to certificateholders and the irs on schedule k the issuer will provide the schedule k information to nominees that fail to provide the issuer with the information statement described below and these nominees will be required to forward such information to the beneficial owners of the certificates generally you must file tax returns that are consistent with the information return filed by the issuer or be subject to penalties unless you notify the irs of all inconsistencies       under section  of the code any person that holds certificates as a nominee at any time during a calendar year is required to furnish the issuer with a statement containing certain information on the nominee the beneficial owners and the certificates so held this information includes the name address and taxpayer identification number of the nominee and as to each beneficial owner     the name address and taxpayer identification number of that person       whether that person is a united states person a taxexempt entity or a foreign government an international organization or any whollyowned agency or instrumentality of a foreign government or an international organization and       certain information on certificates that were held bought or sold on behalf of that person throughout the year       in addition brokers and financial institutions that hold certificates through a nominee are required to furnish directly to the issuer information regarding themselves and their ownership of certificates a clearing agency registered under section a of the securities exchange act is not required to furnish this information statement to the issuer the information referred to above for any calendar year must be furnished to the issuer on or before the following january  nominees brokers and financial institutions that fail to provide the issuer with the information described above may be subject to penalties       we will be designated as the tax matters partner in the trust agreement or limited liability company agreement as applicable and therefore will be responsible for representing you in any dispute with the irs the code provides for administrative examination of a partnership as if the partnership were a separate and distinct taxpayer generally the statute of limitations for partnership items does not expire before three years after the date on which the partnership information return is filed any adverse determination following an audit of the return of the issuer by the appropriate taxing authorities could result in an adjustment of your tax returns and under certain circumstances you may be precluded from separately litigating a proposed adjustment to the items of the issuer an adjustment could also result in an audit of your tax returns and adjustments of items not related to the income and losses of the issuer       tax consequences to foreign certificateholders it is not clear whether the issuer would be considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states for purposes of federal withholding taxes on nonus persons because there is no clear authority dealing with this issue under facts substantially similar to ours although it is not expected that the issuer would be engaged in a trade or business in the united states for these purposes the issuer will withhold as if it were so engaged in order to protect the issuer from possible adverse consequences of a failure to withhold the issuer expects to withhold pursuant to section  of the code on the portion of its taxable income allocable to foreign certificateholders as if this income were effectively connected to a us trade or business at the taxpayers ordinary income tax rate subsequent adoption of treasury regulations or the issuance of other administrative pronouncements may require the issuer to change its withholding procedures in determining a certificateholders nonforeign status the issuer may rely on irs form wben irs form w or the certificateholders certification of nonforeign status signed under penalties of perjury          each foreign certificateholder might be required to file a us individual or corporate income tax return and pay us income tax on the amount computed therein including in the case of a corporation the branch profits tax on its share of accruals of guaranteed payments and the issuers income each foreign certificateholder must obtain a taxpayer identification number from the irs and submit that number to the issuer on form wben in order to assure appropriate crediting of the taxes withheld a foreign certificateholder generally would be entitled to file with the irs a claim for refund for taxes withheld by the issuer taking the position that no taxes were due because the issuer was not engaged in a us trade or business however the irs may assert that additional taxes are due and no assurance can be given as to the appropriate amount of tax liability       backup withholding distributions made on the certificates and proceeds from the sale of the certificates will be subject to a backup withholding tax at a current rate of  if as discussed above in connection with the notes you fail to comply with certain identification procedures unless you are an exempt recipient under applicable provisions of the code see tax consequences to holders of the notes  backup withholding state tax consequences       the above discussion does not address the tax consequences of the purchase ownership or disposition of the notes or certificates under any state or local tax law we suggest that you consult your own tax advisors regarding the state and local tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the notes and certificates erisa considerations       section  of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended  erisa  and section  of the code prohibit a pension profitsharing or other employee benefit plan as well as individual retirement accounts and specified types of keogh plans and collective investment funds or insurance company general or separate accounts in which these plans and accounts are invested we refer to each of these as a benefit plan  from engaging in specified transactions with persons that are parties in interest under erisa or disqualified persons under the code with respect to that benefit plan a violation of these prohibited transaction rules may result in an excise tax or other penalties and liabilities under erisa and the code for these persons the acquisition or holding of securities by a benefit plan could be considered to give rise to a prohibited transaction if the issuer the seller the originator the servicer the subservicer the underwriters the trustee the managing member or the indenture trustee or any of their respective affiliates is or becomes a party in interest or a disqualified person with respect to that benefit plan       in addition transactions involving the issuer might be deemed to constitute prohibited transactions under erisa and the code with respect to a benefit plan that purchased securities if assets of the issuer were deemed to be assets of the benefit plan under a regulation issued by the us department of labor the assets of the issuer would be treated as plan assets of a benefit plan for the purposes of erisa and the code only if the benefit plan acquired an equity interest in the issuer and none of the exceptions contained in the plan assets regulation applied an equity interest is defined under the plan assets regulation as an interest other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features it is likely that the certificates will be treated as an equity interest for these purposes for additional information regarding the equity or debt treatment of notes see erisa considerations in the prospectus supplement       without regard to whether the notes are treated as an equity interest for these purposes the acquisition or holding of notes by or on behalf of a benefit plan could be considered to give rise to a prohibited transaction if the servicer the seller the issuer the subservicer the underwriters the owner trustee or the managing member as applicable the transferor the indenture trustee or any of their respective affiliates is or becomes a party in interest or a disqualified person with respect to that benefit plan exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could apply to the purchase and holding of the notes by a benefit plan depending on the type    and circumstances of the plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire the notes these exemptions include prohibited transaction class exemption  ptce   regarding transactions effected by inhouse asset managers ptce  regarding investments by insurance company general accounts ptce  regarding investments by bank collective investment funds ptce  regarding investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts and ptce  regarding transactions effected by qualified professional asset managers each purchaser of debt securities will be deemed to represent that either a it is not acquiring the securities with the assets of a benefit plan or b the acquisition and holding of the securities will not give rise to a nonexempt prohibited transaction under section a of erisa or section  of the code       employee benefit plans that are governmental plans as defined in section  of erisa and specified church plans as defined in section  of erisa are not subject to the erisa requirements discussed above however governmental plans may be subject to comparable state law restrictions       we suggest that a fiduciary considering the purchase of securities on behalf of a benefit plan consult with its erisa advisors and refer to the prospectus supplement regarding
