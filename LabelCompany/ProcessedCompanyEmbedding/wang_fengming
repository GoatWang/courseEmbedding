everyone our q  revenue was  million representing an increase of  over the  million of revenue in the same period in the prior year for the full fiscal year  our revenue was  million representing a  increase over the  million in the prior fiscal year during the quarter we continue to see strong sales from professional ip security cameras and automotive aftermarket dash cameras as well as from new markets including flying cameras and home monitoring cameras this revenue growth was largely offset however by a continued decline in the wearable sports camera market ambarella is continuing to successfully diversify its end camera market and during the  consumer electronics show in january ambarella showcased its full range of camera solutions spanning automotive home monitoring wearable virtual reality and flying camera markets beginning with the automotive oem market ambarella demonstrated its new motorvu electronic mirror reference design at the show electronic mirrors utilize cameras and lcd displays to augment optical rearview and sideview mirrors to provide a wider unobstructed field of view ambarellas ase base design feature advanced video processing for excellent visibility even in lowlight and high contrast driving conditions while also reducing led headlight flickering the demonstration was done in collaboration with gentex the worlds leading automotive mirror supplier who provided advanced lcd mirror display also during the show ambarella introduced its motorvu d ° surround view reference design the reference design brings highquality hd video to multicamera parking assistance applications and features a dedicated video engine to combine multiple hd video streams for d scene rendering the ability to both record and stream video for multiple cameras enables new use cases such as  degree video security for cars another major theme of ces this year was drones or as we call them flying cameras during the show ambarella displayed many of the major brands now using ambarella camera socs ranging from lower cost consumer models to professional level models with k video were increasingly seeing interest from flying camera makers to run the fly control software on our chips in lower cost design while higher end model continue to split the fly control and camera software across separate microcontroller and camera socs at the show ambarella introduced its new h and h camera soc for the next generation of sports virtual reality and flying cameras h targets highend camera models with k ultra hd hevc video at  frames per second and k avc video at  frames per second this high frame rate delivers smooth video during fast action shots and slow motion playback h also includes bit high dynamic range video processing to handle high contrast scenes and supports dslr quality photography h is ambarellas first nanometer soc the new h soc targets mainstream cameras at lower cost points and offers k ultra hd hevc video at  frames per second both socs have extremely low power consumption allowing for the design of small form factor cameras and feature advanced d electronic image stabilization potentially eliminating the need for mechanical gimbals in flying cameras and in january drone market leader dji announced its phantom  k a k wifi edition of the popular easytofly phantom  series with pricing of only  the newest model in djis phantom  flagship series features an integrated axis gimbal stabilized camera based on ambarellas a camera soc with k video and  megapixel stills also during the quarter chinese drone maker ehang launched the ghost  a consumer drone that comes with virtual reality goggles allowing its user to experience flight through the drones abased k camera the vr goggles come with headtracking which allows the user to simply moving their head to tilt the camera in home monitoring market ambarella continued to expand its customer base both from retail brands as well as from service providers offering cloudbased security solutions during the quarter security service provider adt introduced a new hd home monitoring model the pulse a  indoor camera the camera is based on ambarellas al  soc and features hd video wifi connectivity wideangle viewing ir illumination and motion detection also during the quarter hikvision the worlds largest security equipment manufacturer introduced its new ezviz cs camera for home monitoring the new full hd camera supports small room wideview angle and integrates both temperature and moisture sensors it is based on ambarellas hlm camera soc and during the ces show ambarella introduced its video total payout  solution featuring full hd video with degree viewing in the dynamic zoom this solution allows the user to dynamically zoom between a visitors space and any package lateral  door additionally we partnered with acer corporation to provide a person  recognition solution that integrates with our cloud to enable the video doorbell to automatically recognize a person at the door in automotive aftermarket ambarella provides camera soc solutions for video camera recorders or dash cams we are continuing to see strong demand in china with customer increasingly looking for more sophisticated device with wireless connectivity and driver assistance or features during the quarter tencent holdings limited a major chinese company who service including qq messenger and wechat mobile messaging introduced its shen yun  connected dash cam based on ambarellas aa camera soc the new full hd model features lane departure and forward collision warning algorithms as well as an additional driver facing camera to detect and warn when a driver is fatigued or distracted the camera allows quick and convenient upload over building g connection triggered by a dedicated bluetooth remote button that can be placed anywhere in the car users can also remotely monitor the parked vehicle through live streaming of video over g in addition to new product introductions in our existing markets our customers are creating a number of innovative new camera categories based on our hd and ultra hd socs during ces us based giant  demonstrated its professional grade virtual reality camera in ambarella suite the camera integrates  camera modules with custom optics to provide a full  degree viewing with d stereoscopic video capture junk suite

includes ability to pan zoom and cut between multiple live shots the movi camera is based on ambarellas ase camera soc in terms of our technology development we are continuing to invest in technologies necessary to win an expanding number of camera market such as advanced computer vision which is applicable to multiple markets including automotive security and flying cameras additionally were designing the most advanced process nodes as demonstrated by the successful execution our first nanometer soc h and future designs at both nanometers and nanmeters when combined with ambarellas traditional advantages in image and video quality together with lowest power we believe our solution will remain highly differentiated from competitors products in conclusion we are pleased with our results for the full  fiscal year but not satisfied by our nearterm financial outlook which is being impacted by wearable sports camera sales as we look ahead we are confident that our progress in diversifying our end market combined with successful execution of new camera socs will continue to provide opportunities for innovation and growth now i will turn the call over to george for details of our financial results george w laplante  chief financial officer thank you fermi and good afternoon everyone today i will start with the review of the financial highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal  ending on january   then move on to the financial outlook for q of fiscal year  that ends on april   during the call ill discuss nongaap results and ask that you refer to todays press release for a detailed reconciliation of gaap to nongaap results for nongaap reporting for q we have eliminated stockbased competition expense as well as the increase in the tax provision resulting from a onetime write down of a deferred tax asset that may not be usable in the future our q  revenue of  million represents an increase of  over the  million of revenue in the same period in the prior year in the fourth quarter we had solid yearoveryear growth in ip security flying camera and automotive aftermarket revenues sequentially revenues in the consumer portion of these markets did decline due to normal seasonality as we anticipated on our q earnings call in december fourth quarter revenues from the wearable market were down substantially from the previous year the decline was primarily result of the drop in demand from gopro due to their high inventory levels combined with excess chip inventory at their oem partners purchased for gopro consumption in the ip security market total revenues from all geographic region were in line with our expectations in china ip security didnt demonstrate solid yearoveryear revenue growth but was flat sequentially we continue to monitor the china ip security market due to the economic uncertainties especially as we enter the normally seasonally slow q flying camera revenues sustain the strong yearoveryear revenue growth experienced in the previous two quarters but declined sequentially reflecting the normal seasonal trend for consumer products and q automotive aftermarket revenues continued their positive trend with good yearoveryear growth nongaap gross margin for q of fiscal  was  compared to  in the immediately preceding quarter and  in the fourth quarter of the prior year gross margin in the quarter declined as the lower margin china and home ip security markets became a bigger percentage of revenues in the quarter partially offset by the yearoveryear growth in flying camera revenues nongaap operating expenses for the fourth quarter were  million compared to  million for q  and  million for q the prior year this years q opex decreased from the previous quarter due primarily to lower chip development costs incurred as we expensed the development cost including tape out fees over the development period fluctuations occur based on the timing of engineering efforts on the number of chips were working on nongaap net income for q  was  million or  per diluted ordinary share compared with nongaap net income of  million or  per diluted ordinary share for the same period in the previous year the nongaap effective tax rate in q  was a negative  reflecting a lower annual nongaap tax rate of  for nongaap reporting we eliminated stockbased compensation expense and the impact of the onetime writedown of the deferred tax asset discussed above in the fourth quarter the nongaap earnings per diluted ordinary share are based on  million diluted shares as compared to  million diluted shares for q of fiscal year  looking at the full fiscal year  our revenues of  million represented a  increase over the  million in the prior fiscal year nongaap net income increased to  million from  million in the prior year representing an increase of  total head count at the end of q  was  compared to  at the end of the previous quarter with about  of employees dedicated to engineering approximately  of our total head count is located in asia primarily in taiwan and china we ended q with cash and marketable securities of  million adding  million of cash from operations in the quarter for the full year we added  million of cash from operations total accounts receivable at the end of q  were  million or about  days sales outstanding this compares to accounts receivable of  million or  days sales outstanding in the prior quarter net inventory at the end of q was  million or about  days compared to  million or  days at the end of q accounts receivable and inventory remain in line with company targets wt microelectronics our asia logistic supplier represented  of our revenue in the quarter compared to  for the same period in the previous year chicony electronics company a manufacturer of camera products for multiple oem customers as well as for their own distribution represented  of revenue for q of fiscal  compared to  for the same period in the prior year wt and chicony were the companys only  customers i would now like to discuss the outlook for q of fiscal year  we expect revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year  ending on april   to be between  million and  million representing a decrease of between  and  respectively from q of last year in our december earnings call we said that we expected a moderate decline in q yearoveryear revenues due to inventory adjustments at gopro since that time the actual demand from gopro is expected to decline to the low singledigits as a percent of revenue in q with the likelihood that this weakness will continue at similar levels until the launch of any new products with our chip at this time we remain cautious until we have a better picture of end user demand in this market but as a result of expansion of our other wearable camera business our q wearable revenue should remain in the midteens as a percent of total q revenues we expect flying camera and automotive aftermarket revenues to continue in line with our growth expectations in ip security we are anticipating a small yearoveryear decrease in q revenues due to softness in professional security demand from north america end customers combined with flat revenues in china we estimate q nongaap gross margins to be between  and  compared to  in q and  in q of the prior year margins from camera products are expected to decline from q primarily due to an increase in lower margin revenues from the china ip security and north american home security markets as a percent of overall revenue we expect nongaap net income for the first quarter to be between  million and  million we are using an estimated nongaap annualized effective tax rate of  for the net income amounts we estimate our diluted share count for q to be approximately  million shares i would like to thank everyone for joining our call today and now i will turn it back to the operator to manage the qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of kevin cassidy with stifel your line is open kevin cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you thanks for taking my question george last quarter you gave rough guidance for fiscal year  do you want to update that guidance george w laplante  chief financial officer im not going to update it on this call i think as everybody recognizes the headwinds we have in the sports camera market it is going to be a challenge this year but i think at this point id like to see the timing and really when this sort of revenue stream will start coming back so i think once i understand that better i will update the annual numbers kevin cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay understand and it seems what youre doing in automotive and especially with gentex was exciting you showed at ces can you give us a little clearer view on what the revenue stream might look like when youd start recording revenue in the automotive market maybe on an oem basis george w laplante  chief financial officer i think we havent really changed our position it would be towards the end of next calendar year we would expect to be able to announce customer wins kevin cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you ill get back in the queue operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt ramsay with canaccord genuity your line is open matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc thank you very much good afternoon gentlemen obviously a lot of moving parts here theres been quite a bit i guess written about and discussed about the competitive landscape in the ip security camera market particularly in china with two of the big vendors there fermi maybe you could walk us through or discuss a bit the competitive landscape as you see it particularly in that market with huawei and potentially other competitors and how that competitive landscape may change as your nanometer products are introduced how relevant are the new technologies in your nanometer products to that ip security camera market overall thanks fengming wang  chief executive officer thank you first off all id like to say we dont see the competitive landscape changing at all in the last three months and hisilicon continue to be our major competitor in ip security cameras and they have been really focused on hevc solutions and we continue to work on our advanced technology in fact we announced our k hd soc in last year and also our new sl soc in october last year and you noticed that we just announced our nanometer chip which can do kp and i believe that chip can be used in security camera and will be used in security camera so overall i believe that we have a complete roadmap and sustainable  advantages in terms of video quality compression efficiency and power and cpu performance and i also want to add that inside china we see hisilicon as a major competitor outside china we dont see that much and on top of that were still very comfortable with our  to  gross margin target which already included all of the competitive landscape i just mentioned matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc all right thank you thats helpful george maybe as a followup for you obviously the sale at gopro and all the things that have happened there over the last few months has affected your outlook and your visibility i guess a couple of things for the business outside of the wearable space one overall in that business in your guidance how are the growth trends on a yearoveryear basis for sort of the exgopro business overall and secondly one of the other things that you had mentioned that affected the outlook was inventory of chips at your distribution and logistics partners how healthy is the channel as you see it right now across the different end markets of the business thanks george w laplante  chief financial officer yeah first of all i think you noticed in there we did point out that our other wearable customers are growing we still expect wearable to be in the midteens of our revenue in q you have flee cameras you have other sports cameras so those markets are growing theyre off a small base but we feel comfortable that this year that theyll meet our expectations so were thinking in light of the declining gopro some of that will be offset by other customers now the other question was on end markets and inventory other than the gopro channel inventory levels are at normal levels we do see a little excess inventory in north america security on the professional side but on the consumer side those are fine throughout drones are fine so were pretty comfortable with the rest of the inventory levels out there at customers matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc right thanks ill get back in the queue operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jagadish iyer with redstone technology your line is open jagadish iyer  redstone technology research yeah thanks for taking my question two questions george first if i look at the various buckets that you have in your segments between sports camera as well as ip security and so on how should we think about it in terms of fiscal  in terms of the kind of broad strokes in terms of the growth in fiscal  you grew  despite a headwind in your sports camera market how should we be thinking about that as we just broadly look at fiscal  and then i have a follow up george w laplante  chief financial officer well first of all last year we had substantial growth in our sports camera market in fiscal  as we said on the last call were expecting a significant yearoveryear decline in the sports camera market for fiscal  primarily due to this first half headwinds other than that i think were comfortable with growth rates that we talked about in the other markets yearoveryear growth rates in security and drones as well as the automobile aftermarket obviously the mix will change just because of the decline in sports and we would expect security to become a more significant percent of our overall revenue in fiscal  jagadish iyer  redstone technology research okay okay thats good and fermi you talked about an opportunity with regard to this doorbell if i heard it right fengming wang  chief executive officer thats right jagadish iyer  redstone technology research yeah can you talk about more about that opportunity which geography what kind of dollar content should we be thinking about it and so that we can at least estimate in this kind of a new opportunity fengming wang  chief executive officer right first of all the doorbell is a new application and the function is very simple when some people go to your home ring the doorbell in services have a ring in fact you will trigger a camera the camera will capture video using wifi technology streaming the video to your cell phone directly regardless whether youre at home or somewhere else so you can see who is at the door and you can talk to the guy through audio and also decide what to do so thats the technology we bring to our customer and we see a lot of these activities in fact internationally we have a lot of design wins in us lot of design wins in asia we also start seeing europe start doing this similar design so i think this is really the early phase of this market its hard for me to say about this market yet but considering the value add to the consumers and also the response for our customer im very optimistic about opportunity and also we have the technology as you can imagine that there are two challenges in this technology one is really power consumption because the doorbell has to be operated at very very low power and thats our strength the other one is streaming video through very very narrow bandwidth thats another our strength so from both the point of view we have technology advantage for this kind of applications jagadish iyer  redstone technology research and is there any dollar content that you can put to that particular opportunity at least per device or something like that fermi fengming wang  chief executive officer well i would say that its going to be starting with our lowend to midend of ip security camera type of work  asp i will say midtohigh singledigits asp is what were looking at right now operator okay and our next question comes from the line of daniel amir with ladenburg your line is open daniel l amir  ladenburg thalmann  co inc broker yeah thanks a lot couple questions here first of all on your new soc that youre coming out here the development i guess at least in the nanometer and potentially nanometer i guess what is the timing of some of these products or the roadmap and second what is the cost benefits that you expect to see with regards to these socs and then i have one followup thanks fengming wang  chief executive officer okay so our first nanometer chip h is available for sample right now and we expect to see our customer ramping our product lets say very early next year and i think im comfortable with that and so but at the same time we are ramping up multiple designs at nanometers also we start working on the nanometer design which i think our first nanometer tape out will be next year in terms of cost reduction i have to say that based on nano and nano cost structure i dont believe we get any cost reduction from a per millimeter type point of view but the biggest benefit of nanometer and nanometer is providing a lot of power consumption saving so for lower power application thats where were going to focus this technology on for the people who really dont care about power consumption i think they are better off using our a nanometer process which we have quite a few chips available already daniel l amir  ladenburg thalmann  co inc broker okay and just some housekeeping i mean how should we look at opex and stockbased comp here next couple quarters i mean in terms of visibility george w laplante  chief financial officer opex will come up a little bit as we go forward as we talked about before were collecting a few more head count primarily in our computer vision area as well as additional nanometer tape out fees so we would expect we still expect investment in fiscal year  primarily on the rd side stockbased comp will come up a little bit probably flatten out in the first half over what we saw in q daniel l amir  ladenburg thalmann  co inc broker okay thanks operator thank you our next questions comes from the line of ross seymore with deutsche bank your line is open unknown speaker well thanks for taking my questions this is  calling in for ross with regards to the gross margin do you still expect the back half of this year to decline from the q level and what are the puts and takes that you factored into that forecast also understanding there is a wide range of margins by end product or end market curious that do you see much margin compression within each segment especially in drones and autos where you have higher margins or is product mix the primary swing factor george w laplante  chief financial officer i think were still very comfortable with staying within our target gross margin range of  to  it has come down a little bit quicker than we originally anticipated but the mix going forward should not be that far off with q the primary driver is mix the increase in security revenues particularly china and home security as a percent of the overall revenues is what the primary driver to lower those and the upside driver on that is drone so we always have the opportunity that drones outgrows what were forecasting the potential for upside is there but right now we feel the current  to  is pretty solid for the year unknown speaker okay thanks and then my followup question is weve been hearing reports about more competition especially in china i guess this is kind of across different segments what changes have you seen in the competitive dynamics there fengming wang  chief executive officer well this is fermi i think as we have said we have ill call our major competitor in china is hisilicon and starting two quarters ago qualcomm  tried to compete with us on the drone side and since the ipo ive been talking about there are many many chinese and taiwanese semiconductor house tried to compete with on the low end on the price side and that structure hasnt changed in the last three months and while we continue to move forward with the higher and better socs our competitors moved up too so in fact we still come under the high end very very competitive in mainstream and competing on the price on low end that it doesnt change in fact from the last three months we dont see much of hisilicon the competitive stream exchange  with hisilicon and qualcomm and on the lowend side there are many people try to come in but from the lowend product side i think that those guys probably competing more with the hisilicon and core competitors unknown speaker okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of quinn bolton with needham your line is open quinn bolton  needham  co llc hi fermi and george well first off on the gross margins george it sounds like if the mix is going to stay fairly flat over the next couple of quarters the gross margin outlook doesnt change much from what youre guiding in the april quarter i guess my question is to the extent that you do see a recovery in the sports camera business second half of the calendar year is that a positive for gross margin or does that potentially represent pressure for gross margin george w laplante  chief financial officer i would expect the mix just to remain at the high end in that market which then would be in line with our gross margin quinn bolton  needham  co llc so itd be neutral if it comes back george w laplante  chief financial officer yeah and it depends also what region and volumes and price breaks that we have to give to sell those  the lower – lets say the recovery the higher the pricing would be quinn bolton  needham  co llc got it okay and second question back around at the time of ces youd mentioned you were seeing some promotional activity in the china security market that you thought might create sort of a pause in demand in the april quarter if i heard you right it sounds like youre guiding professional security to be approximately flat in april just wondering if you could give us an update on what that promotional activity was and whether you think it has any sort of hangover in the april quarter fengming wang  chief executive officer yes in fact youre right i think the promotion is done i think that also you see the result our q number has a growth on the professional ip security camera and on the china side after chinese new year the updates were still conservative on that our customer is still being conservative on that but it entails that like you said a lot of inventory to sit down so i think while we continue guide the china is flat and shows that i think were neutral on this market and continue to watch whats going to happen in the next several months quinn bolton  needham  co llc okay and then last question for you fermi i know you mentioned that hisilicon is really pushing hevc it sounds like therere still patent issues around hevc and the adoption of hevc so from your perspective are you seeing the security market willing to adopt hevc solutions or are there ipr issues that kind of keep that h market in the near term fengming wang  chief executive officer yes youre right and i think the hevc patent issue is still lingering there and we havent seen much progress recently however i think a lot of our chinese customers are assuming that the royalty issue is a much lesser issue in china for them so they are more willing to take our hevc adoption than people outside of china so i think thats why hevc youll see more momentum in china than anywhere else quinn bolton  needham  co llc yeah thats why hisilicon can push it as aggressively as they are fengming wang  chief executive officer and also we are pushing very aggressively in china also after we announced the sl and slm and also our latest h and we are very competitive and very complete roadmap for hevc also quinn bolton  needham  co llc great thank you fengming wang  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of charlie anderson with dougherty  company your line is open charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc yeah good afternoon thanks for taking my questions i want to ask about ip security i think in the past youve mentioned what percent of security maybe home security was and i wonder if there was any update there it sounds like that may grow a little bit if ip security professionally is more flattish to maybe a little down and then also on that line you mentioned north america down is that just a function of market share in terms of the china competition any color there would be helpful george w laplante  chief financial officer yeah i think on north america first i think that is shifting – in a shifting demand i think actually europe is doing a very good job in north america as well as the chinese competition so those two geographic regions have picked up market share fengming wang  chief executive officer on the consumer ipcam side i think weve been talking about – we have two different market one is retail channel one is service provider channel and we continue to see strong demand from both and we continue – we believe there will be a high growth rate for us in the consumer ipcam in the coming year charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc great george w laplante  chief financial officer we expect that – yeah i was just going to say we expect that to become a bigger percent of our overall ip security revenues in fiscal  charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc great thank you for that and then the followup for me was fermi you talked about computer vision and youre certainly investing there i wonder as we look at your end markets that are most setup for that drones and if you think about auto i wonder what the battle looks like in terms of did the tier s want to do that themselves versus take something from you is this more of a tier  to tier  market for you or is there an opportunity at tier  for computer vision any color on that would be helpful fengming wang  chief executive officer yeah i think all the tier  want to do themselves but it doesnt mean they want to do a chip themselves in fact they all have their computer vision algorithm so our strategy is to provide a chip which is really target computer vision application by optimizing  optimize for the computer vision algorithm then write our own algorithm on top of that as a reference design and giving the reference design to tier  tier  customers that they can put their algorithm on top of that so they can have a differentiate technology thats our strategy so youre right tier  all wants their own algorithm but they dont mean – that doesnt mean they want to build their own chip charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc got it thank you so much for that operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of marc estigarribia with chardan capital markets your line is open marc estigarribia  chardan capital markets llc thank you for taking my call george fermi maybe you can just give us a little bit of an outlook for the drone market the tam and what did you expect this year in terms of that addressable market but also i guess more importantly to ambarella what is your marketing strategy your position strategy to capture those design wins on a mass market scale fengming wang  chief executive officer okay first of all i think last year was the first big year for drone and in fact the majority of the drone shipment with camera in there are using our solutions and we continue to see the momentum of this market and although – because we cannot find any reliable market research on this we cannot provide a number for you i mean how much it will grow how big the market is but i do believe that all our customers expect this year the market is going to continue to grow in a fast pace and also we are seeing more and more people coming to this market we are seeing many people who want to build drones or trying to go to commercial applications so i think this is a very hot area in fact i have to say is overheated you can even say overhyped market but from a growth rate point of view i think it is very healthy in terms of ambarella strategy to continue to compete in this space we have a twofold strategy one is we need to continue to dominant the highend highend is the majority of the market right now  highend is more like dji phantom  or phantom  type of product and in there they need a best video quality best compression efficiency lower power consumption very good video performance that plays to our strength and also those products will require our best chip for example as we expect our h chip will play in that market on the highend side so to provide kp even kp solution thats still what we like to have and at the same time for lower end market we see a huge amount of momentum there trying to build any price – price range of  to  thats called the lower end drones and we introduced our a and h products at a very competitive solution in fact our customer – i fully expect our customer will use our chip a singlechip solution in there and providing a solution that give them  lower k solution but more importantly we will be able to enable them to do electronic images realization instead using a mechanical gimbal that will save a lot of cost on it so from our strategy point of view we are focusing on continued differentiate on the video quality compression efficiency power consumption image stabilization for both highend and lowend but we have differentiated to support two different markets marc estigarribia  chardan capital markets llc great thank you for that and if you can just comment a little bit about the competition growing specifically on the lowend how big is the risk do you think in terms of possibly losing design wins to qualcomm on the gopro sockets fengming wang  chief executive officer okay so in fact we know that the qualcomm are talking to our customer but we dont see them making much progress with camera solutions in fact we still believe that their current ad processor base solution is quite behind video quality compression efficiency power consumption video features and performance and for your information on gopro drone i cannot make comment on that but its a highend drone like a dji phantom  if you look at dji phantom  there are two major components in there one is the camera soc the other one is a microcontroller for fly control and in that particular design we play only on the camera soc side and we notice that qualcomm is trying to replace the  microcontroller with ad  processor for the flight control functions that might be the angle they are working on right now so thats on the highend drone but on the lowend drone side really no strong need everything either not only low cost but also image stabilization power consumption video compression everything i think we are very well positioned we have multiple solutions out there i believe qualcomm will try to come to compete but i think were ready marc estigarribia  chardan capital markets llc great and just one last follow up please thank you for that in terms of the next catalyst for the mass market device or the mass market socket product to deliver do you think were kind of neckandneck in terms of auto oem versus drones what sort of any color that you can give in terms of which we should expect first or sort of whats going on there fengming wang  chief executive officer i think drone is definitely the nearterm growth opportunity for us but however if you look at the potential market size i have to say auto oem is a lot bigger than drones at peak so while we continue trying to compete with the drone with our latest technology and we continue to invest on different technology so that we hope we can play in automotive oem later were talking about two years three years four years five years later so i think that drone will continue to give us a shortterm growth and hopefully we have longterm growth on the auto oems marc estigarribia  chardan capital markets llc great thank you for the color i appreciate it operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of brad erickson with pacific crest securities your line is open brad erickson  pacific crest securities hi guys thanks for taking my questions first on the drones youve talked historically or i guess in fiscal  that it was going to be about or maybe even a bit above  of revenue what are your expectations for drones as a percentage of revenue within your fiscal  plan george w laplante  chief financial officer we would expect it to increase most likely it could get as high as the high teens as a percent of revenue during the year with the decline in the wearable sports camera obviously the other markets will be a larger percentage brad erickson  pacific crest securities got it thats helpful and then i think – sorry i dropped off the call but i think you said that you were not making any adjustment to the full year outlook in terms of the revenue outlook but did comment on some less clear visibility in the near term is that just strictly around sort of the demand environment for gopro or is there something else going on there in terms of like timing around new products george w laplante  chief financial officer well its both i mean we have the historically old products which we probably wont be delivering anymore chips too so depending on the launch cycle like gopro we really determine when we would start ramping the gopro business in addition to that we did mention that were still watching china professional security closely to see how that progresses over the year brad erickson  pacific crest securities got it and then finally can you just update us on the you talked about – no update to the revenue outlook can you talk about the operating margin outlook and just kind of whether the previous comments you made last quarter in terms of the implied opex for the year if those are still generally consistent thank you george w laplante  chief financial officer yeah i have not – i didnt update the  to  growth rate on this call wed like to see how over the next few months how the – lets say the wearable sports camera market the timing of the recovery there and the extent of the recovery once we understand that little better i would probably say update probably on the next call where we think the year will be obviously its a bigger challenge now because we do feel that the gopro situation will extend into q so we will be watching that in the china security business quite closely operator okay and our next question comes from the line of richard shannon with craighallum your line is open richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc well hi guys thank you for taking my questions i guess just a couple of questions from me fermi id like to follow up on one of your replay to the question a few minutes ago regarding seeing more competition from kind of lower end solutions coming from vendors out of china taiwan et cetera as you think about the entire market and you obviously have a number of segments youre dealing with where trends could be different that but to what extent do you see a continued or even more aggressive push towards higher end solutions where you typically do well versus kind of more mainstream ones where the competition is little bit more fierce and are there markets specifically where youre seeing any meaningful changes or still  maybe two quarters ago or something like that fengming wang  chief executive officer right first of all to clarify that what i say about taiwan china low end competition they have been there for a long time its not just happening recently and they have been consistently trying to compete on the low end side and if you partition in the business into the high end the mainstream at low end they only play on low end side our mainstream business is really competing on an ip security cameras competing with hisilicon and on the sports side or drone side they are much less a competition there so i think from a competition point of view we dont see that its – there is anything changing in the last three months and if you ask me who im worried the most i still think the hisilicon is the one that we watch the most that we make sure that we can continue to compete with that especially in this one call we will continue to mention that we are very comfortable with the  to  gross margin that already considered all of the competitiveness situation including hisilicon qualcomm and all the low end guys you mentioned richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc okay fair enough i think just one more question from me regarding the h product that you introduced couple of months ago i missed the answer about when you expect to see first revenues for that product and is that timeframe changed at all since you introduced the product and if so is that due to customer schedules or more internal to ambarella fengming wang  chief executive officer no i think the schedule didnt change i think very early next year you should start seeing the – we always our customers – to answer that question for any other product in the past we always say our customer take it nine months to  months after we give them sample to go to production consider h is our newest highend chip we expect that our customer will take a little more time so  months is probably right time for us so from that point of view since we already gave a sample to the customer we will release sdk to the customer i fully expect that were working closely with the customer hopefully we can tell them to go to  as quickly as possible richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc okay great i appreciate that clarification thats all the questions from me guys thank you operator thank you and our last question comes from the line of kevin cassidy with stifel your line is open kevin cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks thanks for letting me to have a follow up the phantom  was announced yesterday and had collision avoidance from dji is there any hooks or anything in your soc that helps that is that part of a computer vision product strategy fengming wang  chief executive officer well first of all since the dji didnt say anything about how they implement that computer vision things i would like to refer them to answer most of that but one thing i can say that the computer their computer vision algorithm is not running on our chip yet  kevin cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay great and then also just as a follow up there i believe gopro has made some acquisitions around video editing would there be features in your new chips that would augment or help the video editing fengming wang  chief executive officer again that is a new product for gopro so i would let gopro to answer that question kevin cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah okay thank you fengming wang  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and this concludes our qa session for today i would now like to turn the call back over to dr fermi wang for closing remarks fengming wang  chief executive officer and everybody thanks for joining us today and also i want to send a very special thanks to all of our employees for their dedication and the support and thank
