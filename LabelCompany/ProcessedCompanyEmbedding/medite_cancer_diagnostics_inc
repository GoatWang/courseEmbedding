   phone      fax     contact us cancer markers we developed innovative precancerous diagnostic markers which might have the potential to replace hpv testing for cervical cancer in the future these markers are not just saying there is a risk of cancer because of the detection of an hpv virus instead it identifies the small fraction of hpv infections that are likely to progress to cancer please see the following study confirming our research strategy from march   the dna load of six highrisk human papillomavirus types and its association with cervical lesions these results are consistent with those in a number of other recent papers and with some of the things that we have been seeing with our new assay and associated algorithms one of most important of these for our purposes is that cells that contain high levels of high risk hpv are actually relatively low risk for the development of cervical cancer with the specific type of hr hpv being a secondary factor what this says is that even the genotyping hpv tests can be misleading unless morphology is also factored in medite currently is following the necessary regulatory steps to prepare these new products for market entry

of cancerous and precancerous conditions and related diseases depending upon the type of cancer segments within the current target market of approximately  billion are growing at annual rates between  and  the wellestablished brand of medite cancer diagnostics is well received and remains a professional description of the companys business the companys trading symbol is mdit in  we focused on implementation of several growth opportunities including enhanced distribution of core products through focused sales and distribution channels newly developed and patent pending assays new laboratory devices and several marketing projects like the chinese standardization projects for histology and cytology the company is optimistic about recent marketing efforts focusing on larger laboratory chains and other important strategic relationships the company has  employees in four countries a distribution network to about  countries and a wide range of products for anatomic pathology histology and cytology laboratories available for sale the company successfully sold more internally developed and manufactured devices in  compared to  after the successful market entrance into china in  the companys revenues in this market are approximately  in  compared to  million in  the companys delayed financing during  and  has impacted the delivery of sales due to availability of raw materials parts and work in progress inventory and the needed investment in that inventory the company originally anticipated sales in  of approximately  million with the assumption that the timing of the scheduled capital raise would happen earlier in the year due to the delay in the capital raise the company revised its target to  million total sales for the year ended december   were approximately  million compared to  for the same period in  the chinese market is growing quickly and the company expects it will be one of two largest markets for its products by working with its chinese distributor unic medical the company has successfully received china food and drug administration cfda approval for all medite histology laboratory devices at the end of  and for the cytology device in  the unic medical sales team is selling medite products in china with slightly increasing volumes also together with unic we are part of a government supported project to standardize the histology laboratory process in china unic medical is using medite equipment and consumables for processing and launching new assays unic has taken an active role in branding medite cancer diagnostics in china medite is working through certain product rollout issues which have impacted its anticipated increase in sales on may   unic received cfda approval as a class i in vitro diagnostic reagent for medites surethin cell preservation solution as china adopts cytopathology standards across the country the company expects liquid based cytology tests lbc will be used for the majority of pap collections for cervical cancer screening we are prepared to sell the complete surethin product line including the already approved processor to this potential market of  million women between the ages of  and  years of age management anticipates launching the product in china by the third quarter of  and in the us by the fourth quarter of  the companys cytology product line revenue declined in europe nongyn and gyn applications during  related to a competitive threat that management believes has been alleviated the company is in the process of moving forward the submission of an application to the us food and drug administration fda for surethin gyn applications once approved we can compete with some of the dominant suppliers in this  million market and target major strategic lab partners the impact of the gynecology segment surethin solution in the us and china market will drive significant new revenue and gross margin improvement opportunities in   table of contents the developed and us patented selfcollection device softkit is targeting the growing poc  pop point of care or point of people care market growth in this area is due to consumer driven health care requirements and the necessity to support and address incremental patient population needs for screening and ongoing diagnostic tests softkit serves as just such a product addressing this market requirement softkit is planned to be sold through various marketing channels that serve the gynecology physician consumer health and emerging postacute care as the influence of clinical labs are expanded initially the softkit is targeted at the uterine cancerhpv screening market the next phase of testing will include cervical screening management believes that  developments allows us to more fully leverage the excellent products and biomarker solutions from cytocore component of medite the first entry will be the introduction of surecyte fluorogenic instant staining offering tremendous lab efficiencies and enhanced patient care through the use of surecyte surecyte is the first of many new offering under the surecyte brand medites breast cancer risk assessment product is noninvasive easy gentle and highly sensitive enabling young women between  and  years of age to obtain their individual breast cancer risk assessment an automatic and gentle collection device for breast cells together with a newly developed assay is used to determine a womans risk to develop breast cancer knowing the individual breast cancer risk will provide relief to a majority of young women who have no elevated risk of developing breast cancer for those who have a higher risk it enables them to monitor that risk closer for earlier treatment if needed the earlier a precancerous or cancerous situation is detected the greater the chance for reducing the fatality rate for these conditions product development of breastpap continued in  reflecting feedback from doctors test use of prototype units and doctors office feedback to continuously improve the product prior to launching during the third quarter the company initiated a cooperation with leibnitz university of hannover germany on the final design and usability of the breastpap the project is scheduled to begin on february   the delay in market introduction by management is due to additional quality assurance measures being performed by the company as well as insuring that us feedback from providers are considered the companys breastpap product is a risk assessment tool planned to evaluate the breast cancer risk on certain results based on the treatment upon receiving the results women based upon their physicians advice may be candidates for further diagnostic testing the breatpap will undergo further customer testing in the us and eu markets the company brought several other innovative products closer to marketability during  and continued during  as listed above also in early  the german priority patent for a fully automated system used in the histology lab a labinone unit was granted this technology if successfully accepted by the market has the ability to change the competitive landscape within the industry during the first quarter of  the company opened a second german manufacturing facility with approximately  square feet in nussloch this facility is utilizing the local workforce and their experience for the specialized skills required for manufacturing of the newly developed and updated microtome product line and the newly developed cryostat instruments used for sectioning tissue biopsies during  the company manufactured and delivered from order backlog  units the company began manufacturing the new cryostat line during the first quarter of  and anticipates the first pre serial series to be available before the end of the second quarter the company operates in one industry segment for cancer diagnostics instruments and consumables for histology and cytology laboratories definition histology  cancer diagnostics based on the structures of cells in tissues cancers and precancerous conditions are defined in terms of structural abnormalities in cells for this reason cytology is widely used for the detection of such conditions while histology is typically used for the confirmation identification and characterization of the cellular abnormalities detected by cytology other diagnostics methods such as markerbased assays provide additional information that can supplement but which cannot replace cytology and histology the trend towards more personalized treatment of cancer increases the need for cytology histology and assays for identifying and testing the best treatment alternatives we believe that this segment will therefore be increasingly important for future development of strategies to fight the cancer epidemic world health organizationworld cancer report  which expects about a   increase in cancer cases worldwide within the next  years  table of contents this segment sees a trend toward and demand for higher automation for more throughput in bigger laboratories process standardization digitalization of cell and tissue slides and computer aided diagnostic systems while also looking for cost effective solutions in the us the patient protection and affordable care act is a national example for the industry more people have health insurance and therefore can afford early cancer screening while at the same time the payers for health care continue looking for cost reductions medite acts as a onestopshop for histology also known as anatomic pathology laboratories either as part of a hospital as part of a chain of laboratories or individually it is one out of only four companies offering all equipment and consumables for these laboratories worldwide the medite brand stands for innovative and high quality products  most equipment made in germany  and competitive pricing for the cytology market medite offers a wide range of consumable products and equipment in particular for liquidbasedcytology which is an important tool in cancer screening and detection in the field of cervical bladder breast lung and other cancer types it also developed an innovative easy to use standardized staining solutions and a very innovative and effective early cancer detection markerbased assays these new developments are cost effective solutions able to replace more expensive competitive products and therefore are also becoming the first choice for the growing demand in emerging countries all of the companys operations during the reporting period were conducted and managed within this segment with management teams reporting directly to our chief executive office for information on revenues profit or loss and total assets among other financial data attributable to our operations see the consolidated financial statements included herein further during this  period we added key personnel with excellent historical performance in new product commercialization sales development and internal operations improvement outlook due to promising innovative new products for cancer risk assessment and an increasing number of distributions contracts executed in the last years management believes the profitability and cashflow of the business will grow and improve however significant ongoing operating expenditures may be necessary to manufacture and market new and existing products to achieve the accelerated sales growth targets outlined in the companys business plan to realize the planned growth potential management will focus its efforts on  finishing and gaining approval for the products currently under development and currently the companys sales primarily are generated in euro currency while in  the average usdeuro exchange rate was approximately  it has remained steady to  in  a decrease of  however the end of year conversion rate was  medites sales in usd were lower on a year over year basis as approximately  of our sales currently occurs in euros the company is working to lessen the impact of the euros decline versus the dollar by increasing the percentage of overall product sales in the us and other countries such as china whose currency is not pegged to the euro the company believes the combination of medite enterprise inc with cytocore inc will expedite the development and marketability of cytocores cytology products which include collection devices image analysis software special stains and immunoassays currently the recent launch of new products the positive impact from several new initiatives and some recently executed distribution contracts in the us europe and china are some primary positive factors assisting growth  table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates the company believes that the critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements under note  revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts use of estimates and impairments results of operations fiscal year ended december

totaled   of revenue for the year ended december   compared to   of revenue for the year ended december   this mainly resulted from a higher share of sales of own manufactured equipment with slightly higher margins versus merchandise supply goods in  compared to  research and development research and development expenses are an important part of the companys business to keep our existing products competitive and to develop new innovative solutions with interesting market potential that will help us grow future revenues these expenses include research work for cancer marker consumables and developing work including engineering and industrial design for histology and cytology laboratories worldwide major parts of these expenses are payrollrelated costs for inhouse scientific research
