medicare cover hospice hospice is covered by medicare medicaidmedical and most private insurance congress established the medicare hospice benefit in  to provide patients with lifelimiting illnesses compassionate coordinated care to manage the symptoms and consequences of their disease medicares hospice benefit was designed to help terminally ill patients with the often significant expenses incurred at the end of life including prescription and overthecounter drugs medical equipment and supplies hospital copayments and grief support for the family while the benefit offered a lifeline to terminally ill patients covered by medicare later extended to medicaidmedical and to most private insurance plans it enacted a number of requirements that providers must meet in order to be certified as hospices by medicare and qualify for payment from medicare these include the mandate to provide or manage all services needed to manage the terminal illness read more who pays for hospice other features of the medicare hospice benefit include a limit on the proportion of days of care a hospice can provide in an inpatient setting rather than the patient’s home a global cap on total average payment per patient and a requirement that dedicated and trained volunteers must contribute at least  percent of the hospice provider’s services medicare hospice patient eligibility  for medicare hospice coverage a patient must be eligible for medicare part a consent to hospice care and agree that heshe wishes to receive “palliative not curative care” be certified by hisher physician and the hospice medical director as having a “medical prognosis that hisher life expectancy is six months or less if the illness runs its normal course” continue to have a sixmonthsorless prognosis although some individual patients may receive hospice services for longer than six months as long as they continue to have a limited life expectancy throughout that time vitas hospice patients who meet those qualifications will have their hospice care covered by medicare for care unrelated to a patient’s terminal illness medicare and medicaid continue to provide their usual benefits since each private insurance company has its own policies regarding hospice coverage vitas can contact the patient’s insurer to ask about coverage provided however vitas is committed to admitting and caring for
