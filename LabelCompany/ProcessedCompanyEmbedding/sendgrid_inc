cash distri more search results sendgrid inc   news release  distributed by public on   mapping customer lifecycle transitions note this guest post comes from joshua neckes and brian thompson at simon data simon is a tool that transforms your data into clear insights that let you get more out of your marketing connect your data in minutes create customized segments deploy to existing channels and discover what your customers want its a common misconception that lifecycle marketing is about triggers like triggering an associated email text or push notification when someones abandoned their cart at simon data we think that lifecycle marketing is about transitions in the customer journey when customers move from stage to stage as they engage with your brand savvy ecommerce companies build sophisticated lifecycle campaigns around these specific welldefined transitions seeking to move customers from a less valuable cohort to a more valuable cohort optimizing around these critical lifecycle milestones yields meaningful increases in customer lifetime value ltv each business has its own unique dynamics and transition points early on instagram found that once a user uploaded three photos their tendency toward daily app usage increased dramatically accordingly the entire onboarding flow was built and optimized to encourage and incentivize customers to hit that three photo mark at etsy the team found something similar with sellers once theyd listed six items on the platform their ltv increased substantially as a result the team spent a tremendous amount of time devising strategies to encourage sellers to list more whats the friction once a critical lifecycle transition point is found the next step is figuring out how to ensure customers make it through that transition a given point may have a variety of different friction points that inhibit the transition take the instagram example one concern might be availabilitya given user may not have three photos that they want to share for someone else the issue might be privacy and being uncertain about who might see their photo for yet another user the problem could be a confusing process around uploading photos each of these friction points requires a separate remediation to help facilitate the transition from user with less than  photos to user with more than  photos its through creative ideation datadriven testing and crosschannel engagement that companies like instagram and etsy are able to build multifaceted programs that cumulatively account for and address these transition points common transitions and their dynamics while each business has unique transitions and friction points within specific verticals and industries there are observable trends across businesses below we explore some of the more critical and universal transition points for ecommerce businesses  anonymous  activated regardless of brand focus or vertical an essential transition is when a user provides their contact information datadriven brands understand the net value of each new email address by acquisition channel and can deploy a variety of interventions to prevent disengagements and bounces incentives typically lead the way but a strong content strategy can often be enough to prompt an anonymous user to opt in  activated  first purchase once someone has activated and provided their information the next transition is that critical first purchase here ecommerce businesses often combine aggressive retargeting with wellhoned welcome messages push email or both that are purposebuilt for conversion this coupled with activation is the transition point that receives by far the most investment it makes sense of course as a conversion is a favorable metric for measuring growth and future potential engagement however excessive focus on this transition can sometimes be detrimental to other critical life cycle transitions including those below  first purchase  second purchase postpurchase flows are often underdeveloped compared to their firstpurchase counterparts this is typically due to lack of data or capabilities to target users based on first purchase dynamics eg item amount season review content etc its important to be wary of the several potential friction points that arise at this stage a firsttime buyers initial purchase during the holiday season might have been for someone else another customer may have bought on a whim with no real interest in the category another may have a bad first experience which is notoriously challenging to overcome following initial conversion marketers should dedicate more resources to driving a second purchase  second purchase  nth purchase while almost every company we see has some sort of postpurchase flow theres a very uneven engagement landscape following a second purchase and beyond repeat purchasing dynamics are very companyspecific and verticaldependent for example the more diverse a product catalog the more likely downstream retention will be savvier companies can often provide product recommendations but struggle to intersperse content and branded messaging that reinforces the customers emotional connection with the brand and a purely transactional relationship predicated on personalized offers often leads to disengagement and churn in our next post well cover the next  lifecycle transitions

entrepreneurs of  inccom announces the readers choice winner thursday june 6 sendgrid is at its heart a bd or businesstodeveloper company the companys email product is more of a byproduct  after graduating from the university of california riverside with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science in  isaac saldana the companys cofounder encountered his aha moment when he launched a couple of tech startups just out of school he noticed a major problem for software developers it was very difficult to enable apps to send automated emails alerting users to something happening on the network  so saldana decided to build the infrastructure that would better ensure that deliverability along with cofounders tim jenkins  and college buddy jose lopez  saldana formally launched sendgrid after graduating from the techstars accelerator program in  five years and  million in funding later the company employs  and is responsible for delivering approximately  percent of the worlds nonspam email and though email would become the companys main revenue driverclients include uber spotify and pinterestthe heart of the company rests with its core inspiration developers theres sendgrid the product saldana says referring to the companys flagship email deliverability system and theres sendgrid the company sendgrid the company is about making developers lives easier to that end saldana hired former oracle executive jim franklin as sendgrids ceo in  when the company had just  employees though franklin runs the company saldana now president keeps his eye on product development hes a creator and an innovator franklin says he wants to be building the product every day when he was ceo he was still sitting at a computer building stuff without the businesss daytoday to weigh on him saldana has kept his focus on where his passions lie developing and although that means tinkering with the sendgrid product it also means finding new product avenues for the company  saldana and franklin agree the companys focus on developers gives sendgrid the mandate to create products well outside the realm of email deliverability part of saldanas work today is focused on sendgrid labs the companys innovation studio which releases and sells tools for developers that the company has found helpful in building its own products for example one of its early releases loaderio helps developers test app functionality as traffic scales saldana thinks any tool that helps developers do their job especially in the cloud falls under sendgrids umbrella meaning the email plumbing saldana says hes passionate about is really just one aspect of what could be a much larger system developers dont have all the tools and were on a mission to create them he says since the beginning we were also developers   published on jun
