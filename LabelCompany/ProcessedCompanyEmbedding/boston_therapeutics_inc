oxygen carrier is an injectable rx for prevention of necrosis and treatment of ischemic conditions which may lead to necrosis ipoxyn™ oxygen carriers are in preclinical stage of drug development necrosis and ischemia cell death can occur through two main mechanisms apoptosis and necrosis apoptosis is a tightly regulated process in the body and many of the intracellular proteins and enzymes involved are well characterized necrosis has been viewed in the past as an accidental pathological mode of cell death recently evidence has indicated that some forms of necrotic cell death could be related to intrinsic cellular mechanisms necrosis is always the outcome of severe and acute injury it is involved in many pathological conditions such as heart attack brain injuries and stroke neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s disease dementia and lou gherig’s disease septic shock liver cirrhosis chronic hepatitis pancreatitis muscle necrosis diabetes mellitus acute or critical limb ischemia gangrene chronic pressure ulcers and many others necrosis occurs following ischemia shortage of oxygen supply to the tissue due to restriction in blood supply the only treatment available at present for necrosis is providing oxygen by a high pressure facility thus there is a crucial need to develop drugs for prevention and treatment of this pathology limb ischemia is a chronic condition of severe obstruction of the peripheral circulation that results in severe pain in the extremities due to the constriction of blood vessels especially capillaries red blood cells are unable to flow through them and this disruption in the microcirculation leads to the deprivation of oxygen or ischemia complications include gangrenous sores and wounds that won’t heal typically in the legs and feet if left untreated these lesions can result in amputation of the affected limb lower limb ischemia is a lifethreatening complication for patients with poorlycontrolled diabetes and affects  of the diabetic population brem harold tomiccanic marjana  cellular and molecular basis of wound healing in diabetes jci   – doijci pmc  pmid  httpwwwpubmedcentralnihgovarticlerenderfcgitoolpmcentrezartid for decades oxygen carriers have been developed for perfusion and oxygenation of ischemic tissue none have yet succeeded these products were either bloodderived elements synthetic perfluorocarbons or red blood cell modifiers several of the hemoglobinbased oxygen carriers hboc contained nonfunctional methemoglobin impurities these products failed to secure fda approval based upon either poor outcomes in clinical trials or poorly formulated product new approach our approach to treatment of ischemic tissue and prevention of necrosis is fundamentally different boston therapeutics’ injectable drug ipoxyn™ is a new chemical entity nce and not a biologic blood substitute ipoxyn™ is a modified heme chemical structure a significant improvement over hbocs ipoxyn™ prevents methemoglobin formation associated with the adverse effects of vasoconstriction and myocardial infarction furthermore because of ipoxyn™’s extremely small molecular size roughly th the size of a red blood cell ipoxyn™ is able to perfuse constricted ischemic capillaries which are inaccessible to red blood cells this small molecular size has particular significance in treating vascular complications of diabetes since red blood cells may already be enlarged and lower limb vasculature may be compromised recent news jun   boston therapeutics

btheotc boston therapeutics inc is focused on developing products that address the diabetes and inflammatory disease markets employing novel complex carbohydrate chemistry ccc technologythe company’s portfolio includes two developmentstage candidates—bti and ipoxyn and veterinary analog oxyfex—and a marketed overthecounter otc dietary supplement called sugardown® the company is positioned to benefit from two simultaneous paths to market—otc and pharmaceutical drug development bti is a nonsystemic tablet for the postmeal reduction of the elevation of blood glucose the compound is designed to be taken before meals to inhibit the carbohydratehydrolyzing enzymes that release glucose from carbohydrates during digestion bti has demonstrated a favorable safety profile with minimal side effects in large part because it is a nonsystemic method for treating diabetes the company is preparing documents for an ind submission with the fda for a phase iii study bti addresses an unmet medical need for people to manage their blood sugar especially in those who are prediabetic and for people with type  diabetes lower blood glucose is believed to slow the onset and progression of diabetes and its complications the compound’s api holds generally recognized as safe gras classification the company’s strategy of combining proven compounds with novel delivery methods and pharmaceutical compositions seeks to reduce development time and costs and lower regulatory risks while delivering valuable products in areas of unmet need to the marketplace a phase iia trial conducted at dartmouth medical center in lebanon new hampshire showed that bti was well tolerated in patients taking various antidiabetic agents including metformin phase iib is ongoing and has completed patient enrollment trial results are expected in late  boston therapeutics’ marketed product sugardown® is an otc nonsystemic chewable dietary supplement taken prior to meals in order to reduce postmeal elevation in glucose the product works in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce the spikes in blood sugar associated with eating high carbohydrate foods also in development is ipoxyn a glycoproteinbased injectable therapeutic agent that may prove successful in reversing an inadequate supply of oxygen and support various metabolic functions in the body in a manner and with effects similar to those resulting from the infusion of rbcs—without the limitations of compatibility availability short shelf life volume and logistical challenges commonly associated with whole blood transfusions the initial indication for ipoxyn could be lowerlimb ischemia associated with diabetes ipoxyn is being targeted to both the human and animal market—where tissues and organ systems are deprived of oxygen and are in need of metabolic support boston therapeutics’ management is highly experienced with its ceo david platt phd a pioneer in designing therapeutic drugs made from carbohydrates for the past two decades he is also the inventor or coinventor on a number of patents and been significantly involved in the approval process for several drugs the company is the third startup founded by dr platt—the first two were international gene group whose core technology gcs was acquired by prospect therapeutics and is now known as lajolla pharmaceuticals and propharmaceuticals which is now galectin therapeutics core technologies of both of these companies were either developed or codeveloped by dr platt boston therapeutics’ product candidates are welldifferentiated formulations that address significant unmet medical needs the company is working to secure a robust intellectual property portfolio composed of patents patent applications and trademarks  the technology and products are currently protected by two patent applications filed under the international patent cooperation treaty pct and their related nationalstage applications one provisional patent application in the us and several trademarks boston therapeutics’ patent portfolio covers three main areas  mannans  hemoglobin composition and methods of use and  taste masking in

restructured operations activity in a two part session covering the last five months as well as a look forward to anticipated milestones as an innovator in designing compounds using complex carbohydrate chemistry the company has initiated the deployment of some of its investigative formulations in a sequenced product pipeline it is focused on developing commercializing and partnering as well as exploring global merger opportunities to leverage therapeutic molecules and therapeutic protein combinations that address prediabetes diabetes and inflammatory diseases including bti the first nonsystemic chewable therapeutic agent designed to reduce hbac indirectly through active reduction of the amount of free sugar that can be absorbed in the gut this is a significant step for a potentially safe and effective nonhypoglycemia inducing material that could reduce the risks for many who are experiencing poor outcomes from diabetes and the associated metabolic disease related insultscurrent state of affairsthe prevalence of prediabetes and impaired glucose tolerance is believed to becoming a global epidemic as evidenced by the rapidly increasing incidence of high blood glucose levels and obesity throughout the world the hallmark of prediabetes  chronically impaired blood glucose response  is a significant risk factor for the development of type  diabetes mellitus tdm as well as the manifestation of metabolic syndromes including obesity hypertension nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases hypertriglyceridemia cardiovascular diseases and stroke a growing body of evidence suggests that postprandial hyperglycemia and glycemic variability are independent risk factors for increasing the mortality and accelerating the development of tdm dietary control to restore normal postprandial glycemic response ppgr is emerging to be critically important in the prevention of tmd and related metabolic syndromes to date no effective dietary method can readily or accurately predict ppgr associated with food type where the current gold standard estimates ppgr through carbohydrate content or glycemic index as guided reference glycemic variability often limits the applicability of the two methods in a reallife patient management situation as such personalized diets with glycemic variability taken into consideration require special focus for intervention to control ppgr and modify its subsequent metabolic consequences new portable wearable continuous glucose monitoring devices dexcom inc us medtronics ireland etc open a new important selfmanagement technique for better healthcare management and for the accurate and clinically relevant effect that a compound can have on postprandial blood sugar spikes boston therapeutics is working with these advanced technologies sensors and wearable devices to employ mobile apps that have the potential to offer patient access to clinically significant data monitoring for realtime development of the bti investigative drug materials this complements existing data and will provide a more complete view of safety and significant efficacy for the management and even delay and risk reduction of these metabolic disease related illnesses this effect will be supported by the hallmark reductions of hbacrecent clinical confirmation the investigative material from boston therapeutics bti has been in development for the past several years and with operational licensing partners in asia we have progressed what is believed to be a new and patented effective investigative material for the benefit of safe blood glucose management in a proof of concept trial protocol code sg conducted at the chinese university of hong kong cuhk positive effect of bti on postprandial hyperglycemia in a highrisk prediabetic chinese population was demonstrated an abbreviated description of this clinical trial innovation was presented at the seminar for frontier technologies with impact in public health in the chinese university of hong kong sponsored by the hong kong jockey club school of public health and primary care in september  this group continues to be a key collaborator in this and future trials announcement of basic data sets was reported on clinicaltrialsgov httpsclinicaltrialsgovctshownct in january  data analyses and manuscripts are currently under embargo pending potential presentation

clinical trial nct clinicaltrialsgov with   overall compliance across study groups the phase ii proof of concept trial protocol code sg demonstrated that both low dose g and high dose g bti are safe and effective in significantly reducing various continuous glucose monitor cgms parameters when compared against placebo the relevant glycemic variability presented in preliminary analyses as a positive confirmation of reducing blood sugar spikes demonstrated no change in fructosamine a measure of short halflife glycated plasma proteins from the baseline to week  of the observation period no anticipated change is expected due to sufficient glycemic control in this prediabetic population further confirmation of control bti can be reported to be effective in inhibiting and lowering postprandial glucose excursions and reflects greater reduction in many of the cgms parameters when compared to placebo from baseline to week  of the study period mbg mean blood glucose auc area under

diabetes management and care in the prevention of igt and other prediabetic conditions to account for the glycemic variability among individual subjects on a daytoday basis supplementary cgms analyses with variability adjusted were performed to appropriately reflect the drug effects of bti on an individual level with no group data pooled the validated supplementary analyses were carefully designed to explore the sugar spike reduction effect of low dose g and high dose g of bti against placebo via cgms parameters in a controlled setting since bti was previously demonstrated to significantly reduce postprandial glucose and insulin response in a controlled glycemic loading study at the sydney university glycemic index research services sugirs among a normal volunteer population overweight but otherwise healthy subjects it was hypothesized that both low and high dose of bti were also effective in reducing some cgms parameters among the high risk prediabetic asian population full data to be presented in june  manuscript in process planned milestonesin october  the company and advance pharmaceutical company limited apcl announced collaborative advancement in the clinical development of bti and apcl will be receiving up to us from the hong kong innovation and technology commission itc for advance screening by proprietary automated retinal image analysis aria the device is an noninvasive screening tool that will be used in a randomized controlled cross over dose study to compare the effect of bti in subjects n at high risks for diabetes and stroke the objective of the study will be evaluation on the effect of bti at dose with control on i calculated year probability of stroke and ii glycated hemoglobin hbac and fructosamine in prediabetic subjects the goal will be to obtain a proof of concept for inclusion of bti as adjunctive therapy in the consideration of an atrisk aging population where the identification and early life style change can have a significant
