 cik  we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by the holders competitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position leading to a possible loss of customers or a decrease in prices either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits our competitors are numerous ranging from large multinational corporations which have significantly greater capital resources than us to relatively small and specialized firms we also compete with the major manufacturers our business could be adversely affected because of increased competition from these athletic apparel companies  the fitness apparel industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control including the timely development and introduction of our fitness clothing and its enhancements its functionality performance reliability customer service and support and marketing efforts due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the textiles market we expect additional competition from other emerging companies many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources as a result they may be able to respond more quickly to fashion changes and have greater resources for the development and promotion of their products there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition company description we were incorporated in the state of utah on december   to engage in the development and sale of womens fitness clothing  our operations to date have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities which include i formation of the company ii development of our business plan iii development of our water and radiowave resistant sports bra pocket croenest and other fitness apparel iv development of our brand v and marketing and sales of croe hats and jewelry we have not completed development of our croenest and apparel and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing the development we are developing a pocket or croenest to hold your phone while you are exercising or going about your daily activities this is the hallmark product of our company the croenest has been developed with a radiation repellent material that blocks the  of the radiation and radiowave we have found skin compatible fabrics for radio frequency shielding cellphones and cell tower radiation cordless phones wifi radar microwave oven leakage tv broadcast etc extremely thin silver coated copper wires are spun with cotton or polyester yarns then woven into washable comfortable and durable fabrics with the look and feel of normal fabric the fabrics we are testing materials to use for the croenest have the following characteristics · ecological cotton fabric without chemicals · contain no harmful substances · independently tested for shielding performance · nonconductive surface · no grounding needed · translucent · unbleached ecological cotton fabric · extremely wide format  feet wide · washable easy to iron cut and sew technical data · raw materials  cotton  copper  silver · attenuation  db at  ghz · color ecruwhite · weight  gm² · dimension stability   we have also found a light weight water resistant material to add to our croenest to keep your phone dry while you sweatthe finalization of the croenest does not require any more capital to develop it will require additional capital to incorporate the croenest into the design of our sports bras and other products we have developed six different prototypes of sportsbras with the croenest we have tested our sports bras by having friends and family wear the bras while exercising three times a week washing the bras after every use testing the durability of the croenest material with a radio sensor device and getting feedback the feedback has included comfort level accessibility of the cell phone while workingout water resistant satisfaction and durability we are satisfied with the croenest exactly as we have developed it we are still trying to find the proper materials and manufacturer for the other parts of our sportsbras shorts and yoga pants we plan to develop our croe brand to be functional and protective our team plans to develop a product that every runner cyclist and active person may want our plan for bringing this product to the national and international retail distribution market is fivefold · acquire investment capital to design and manufacture our fitness apparel · create a systematic duplicable process within our business for inventory management and order fulfillment · utilize an aggressive marketing platform including sales team social media trade shows athletic events and sponsored events to drive a product demand as well as any publicity resulting from our philanthropic endeavors · penetrate the us market · penetrate the international market beginning with canada australia and the uk once established in these markets we have goals to expand into europe south america south africa and southeast asia consistent with croe’s philosophy of encouraging individuals to pursue their passions the company is dedicated to supporting and promoting causes in the areas of health education and athletics with the resources acquired through business expansion

marketing team and strategic partners to develop and further the business insisting upon evolving with the everchanging trends of the marketplace our goal is to always utilize the necessary assets for brand growth and sustainability we aim to capitalize on the same opportunities that enable our competitors to thrive and to surpass them through the universal appeal of our philosophy and vision our
