investing in mbs entails various risks including credit risks inherent in the underlying collateral the risk that the servicer fails to perform its duties liquidity risks interest rate risks structure risks and geographical concentration riskscredit risk debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due  investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis

also increase a fund’s liquidity risk as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limitslimited term risk it is anticipated that the fund will terminate and liquidate its assets and return the proceeds to its shareholders on or before a specific date although it could terminate sooner or later under certain conditions  the fund may be

there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful  derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount investedmbs prepayment risk mbs represent an interest in a pool of mortgages these mortgages typically permit borrowers to prepay amounts owing often with no penalty  in periods of falling interest rates the rate of prepayments tends to increase forcing a fund to reinvest in loweryielding securities  however prepayment risk for a mbs may not be the same as call risk for a
