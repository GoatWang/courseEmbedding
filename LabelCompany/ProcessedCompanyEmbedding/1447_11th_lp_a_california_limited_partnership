corporations partnerships limited partnerships limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships the partnerships that limit personal liability for business debts by peri pakroo share on google plus share on facebook limited partnerships lps and limited liability partnerships llps are both businesses with more than one owner but unlike general partnerships limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships offer some of their owners limited personal liability for business debts in limited partnerships lps at least one of the owners is considered a general partner who makes business decisions and is personally liable for business debts but lps also have at least one limited partner who invests money in the business but has minimal control over daily business decisions and operations the advantage for these limited partners is that they are not personally liable for business debts the limited liability partnership llp is a similar business structure but it has no general partners all of the owners of an llp have limited personal liability for business debts in order to better understand lps and llps its helpful to compare them to general partnerships what is a general partnership in the business world the word partnership usually refers to general partnerships a general partnership is a business that has more than one owner and that has not filed papers with the state to create a specific entity such as a corporation or limited liability company llc to learn more about general partnerships see nolos partnerships area in a general partnership all partners called general partners are personally liable for all business debts including court judgments each individual partner can be sued for the full amount of any business debt though that partner can in turn sue the other partners for their share of the debt and each partner has agency authority for the partnership  that is each partner can bind the whole business to a contract or business deal how are limited partnerships different a limited partnership has at least one general partner and at least one limited partner the general partner has the same role as in a general partnership controlling the companys daytoday operations and being personally liable for business debts the role of limited partners however differs in a few ways limited partners do not play an active role in the business the limited partners most lps have more than one limited partner contribute financially to the business for example a limited partner might invest  in a real estate partnership but have minimal control over business decisions or operations and normally cannot bind the partnership to business deals limited partners are not personally liable in return for giving up management power limited partners get the benefit of protection from personal liability this means that a limited partner cant be forced to pay off business debts or claims with personal assets a limited partner however can lose his or her financial investment in the business limited partners face slightly different tax rules for income tax purposes limited partnerships generally are treated like general partnerships with all partners individually reporting and paying taxes on their share of the profits each year limited partners as a rule do not have to pay selfemployment taxes because they are not active in the business their share of partnership income is not considered earned income for purposes of the selfemployment tax limited partners need to understand that they can become personally liable if they do not stick to their passive role if a limited partner starts taking an active role in the business that partners liability can become unlimited if a creditor can prove that a limited partner took acts that led the creditor to believe that he or she was a general partner that partner can be held fully and personally liable for the creditors claims some states have carved out exceptions to this active role in the business rule these exceptions usually allow a limited partner to vote on issues that affect the basic structure of the partnership including the removal of general partners terminating the partnership amending the partnership agreement or selling all or most of the assets of the partnership without jeopardizing limited partner status limited liability partnerships another kind of partnership called a limited liability partnership llp or sometimes called a registered limited liability partnership rllp provides all of its owners with limited personal liability llps are particularly wellsuited to professional groups such as lawyers and accountants in fact in some states llps are only available to professionals professionals often prefer llps to general partnerships corporations or llcs because they dont want to be personally liable for another partners problems  particularly those involving malpractice claims an llp protects each partner from debts against the partnership arising from professional malpractice lawsuits against another partner a partner who loses a malpractice suit for his own mistakes however doesnt escape liability forming a corporation to protect personal assets may be too much trouble and some states including california wont allow licensed professionals to form an llc how to create an lp or llp creating a limited partnership or limited liability partnership is done at the state level each state has its own rules but in general you must pay a fee and file papers with the state usually a certificate of limited partnership or certificate of limited liability partnership this document is similar to the articles or certificate filed by a corporation or an llc and includes information about the general and limited partners filing fees for lps and llps are similar to those for corporations and llcs for more information on limited partnerships including how to draft a limited partnership agreement get

devine  company inc “murray devine” collectively “appellants” appeal the district courts order granting plaintiffappellee wr huff asset management co “huff” leave to file the fourth amended complaint   for the reasons set forth below we conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction   accordingly we dismiss the appeali procedural posturehuff is an investment management company   in  huff invested approximately  on behalf of its clients in subordinated notes “notes” issued in connection with the leveraged recapitalization of an alabama grocery chain brunos inc “brunos”  kkr engineered brunos recapitalization   robinson humphrey issued a fairness opinion related to the recapitalization and murray devine issued a solvency opinion in connection with the recapitalization   roughly twoandahalf years later brunos filed for bankruptcy in delaware   on august   huff filed suit in alabama state court for fraudulent transfer breach of fiduciary duty aiding and abetting and conspiracy   kkr removed the case to the bankruptcy court for the northern district of alabama   in october of  brunos bankruptcy examiner released a report prepared for kkr in may of  which cited numerous material accounting flaws in financial statements approved by brunos accountants arthur andersen   as a result on may   huff filed a second amended complaint “second amended complaint” asserting state law claims based on material misrepresentations and omissions in brunos public filings   huff brought the action as an investment advisor and attorneyinfact on behalf of certain beneficial owners of the notes   huffs federal securities fraud claims were already barred by a three year statute of repose   see  usc § rcthereafter the alabama bankruptcy court returned the action to alabama state court   appellants removed the case to federal court on the grounds that huffs state law claims were precluded by the securities litigation uniform standards act of  “slusa”  two weeks later in an explicit attempt to avoid slusa preclusion huff filed a third amended complaint “third amended complaint” asserting only claims for misrepresentations made after brunos stock was delisted from the nasdaq   huff also dropped defendants murray devine and robinson humphrey because they were involved only in misrepresentations made prior to delisting   the district court did not rule on the third amended complaint for three years and three monthsin the interim in light of developments in a related proceeding huff moved for leave to file a fourth amended complaint “fourth amended complaint”   again huff acknowledged that the fourth amended complaint was an attempt to avoid slusa preclusion   slusa provides for the removal of “covered class actions”   usc § pc  the term “covered class action” includes “any single lawsuit” involving “a covered security” in which “one or more named parties seek to recover damages on a representative basis on behalf of themselves and other unnamed parties similarly situated”  id §§ pc f  however slusa only governs actions filed by fifty or more individually named plaintiffs   usc § pfaii   thus huff sought to substitute as plaintiffs fortysix individual note holders   the fourth amended complaint also relisted murray devine and robinson humphrey as defendantson february   the district court denied leave to file the fourth amended complaint and dismissed the case with prejudice   the district court stated that the proposed amendment   violated a prior judicial order   was untimely   was unduly burdensome on kkr  and  was a waste of judicial resources   on appeal a prior panel of this court vacated and remanded   the panel rejected the reasoning of the district court but explicitly reserved judgment on whether there were alternate legitimate reasons to deny leave to amend   on june   after remand the district court issued an order granting leave to file the fourth amended complaint under the liberal amendment provision in federal rule of civil procedure a   immediately thereafter the district court observed that slusa was the only asserted basis for federal jurisdiction and slusa being inapplicable to the fourth amended complaint the district court remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction   appellants filed the instant appealin this appeal appellants challenge the district courts ruling granting leave to file the fourth amended complaint   the amendment permitted a substitution of plaintiffs eliminating huff in his representative capacity and substituting therefor fortysix individual plaintiffs   the amendment also relisted murray devine and robinson humphrey as defendants thus abandoning the attempt in the third amended complaint to drop these two defendants   appellants raise several issues including inter alia   whether huff is the sole real party in interest   whether huff is an indispensable party   whether the district court erred in allowing the addition of two defendants after huff deliberately dropped them in the proposed third amended complaint   whether the statute of limitations prevents the relisting of these defendants  and  whether the district court erred in allowing the amendment because it constituted a circumvention of slusa   the foregoing will be referred to in this opinion as the “merits issues”   however we must first determine whether we have appellate jurisdiction to entertain these merits issuesii appellate jurisdiction“an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise”   usc § d  “the policy of congress opposes interruption of the litigation of the merits of a removed cause by prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed”  kircher v putnam funds trust  us    sct    ledd    “for over a century now statutes have accordingly limited the power of federal appellate courts to review orders remanding cases removed by defendants from state to federal court”  id  the supreme court has “relentlessly repeated that any remand order issued on the grounds specified in § c is immunized from all forms of appellate review whether or not that order might be deemed erroneous by an appellate court”  kircher  us at   sct at  notwithstanding the force of the § d bar the case law has staked out limited exceptions   thus we may review orders “that lead to but are separate from orders of remand and have a conclusive effect upon the ensuing state court action”  aquamar sa v del monte fresh produce na inc  fd   th cir   this doctrine flows from the supreme courts decision in city of waco v united states fidelity  guaranty co  us   sct   led     in waco the defendant impleaded a thirdparty and removed the case to district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction   the district court concluded that the thirdparty was an unnecessary and improper party and dismissed the crosscomplaint  waco  us at   sct at    after the dismissal there was no diversity between the remaining parties and the district court remanded the case to state court for lack of jurisdiction  id  the defendant appealed the dismissal of the crosscomplaint   the supreme court recognized that no appeal lies from an order of remand  waco  us at   sct at    however noting that “the crossaction will be no part of the case which is remanded to the state court” the court concluded that “indisputably the order of dismissal is the subject of an appeal  and if not reversed or set aside is conclusive upon the petitioner”  id in this case we can assume arguendo but need not decide that this appeal would satisfy waco because our case law also requires that the order appealed from be final under  usc §  and because we hold that the district courts order in the instant case is not final   see flohr v mackovjak  fd   th cir addressing a § d issue and after holding that waco was satisfied holding  “we may thus take jurisdiction over mackovjaks appeal provided that the denial of his motion to substitute is a ‘final order’ within the terms of  usc § ”  see also aquamar  fd at  holding that appealability of the district courts order that led to but was separate from the remand order had to satisfy both the waco doctrine and the finality rule collateral order doctrine  accord price v j  h marsh  mclennan inc  fd   d cir  powers v southland corp  fd   d cir “section  of the judicial code generally vests courts of appeals with jurisdiction over appeals from ‘final decisions of the district courts”  cunningham v hamilton county  us    sct    ledd     the general rule is that a district court order is considered final and appealable only if it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment  catlin v united states  us   sct   led     obviously the instant district court order does not end the litigation on the merits   however the supreme court has “interpreted the term ‘final decision’ in §  to permit jurisdiction over appeals from a small category of orders that do not terminate the litigation   that small category includes only decisions  that are conclusive  that resolve important questions separate from the merits and  that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action”   us at   sct at  internal citations and quotations omitted   this three prong test is referred to as the collateral order doctrine   the rule of finality is motivated in large part by considerations similar to those supporting the bar in § d to review of remand ordersthe rule is in accordance with the sensible policy of avoiding the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise from its initiation to entry of judgment   the rule also serves the important purpose of promoting efficient judicial administrationcunningham  us at   sct at  internal quotations omittedthus we examine whether the district court order for which appellants seek review satisfies the collateral order doctrine   our analysis leads to the conclusion that the district courts order is effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment in state court   accordingly the district courts order does not satisfy the third prong of the collateral order doctrine and we have no jurisdiction to review it we begin by noting that an order permitting the substitution of plaintiffs is ordinarily interlocutory and unappealable   see delta coal program v libman  fd   th cir deciding an “interlocutory appeal to challenge the district courts ․ order allowing thirtyfive individual plaintiffs to be substituted for a limited partnership”  see also porter v maule  fd   th cir concluding that an order substituting plaintiffs was “interlocutory and unappealable”   similarly an order permitting or denying joinder of parties is typically interlocutory   see united states v taylor  fd   th cir unit a  citing fowler v merry  fd   th cir “although an order refusing or permitting the filing of an amended complaint joining an additional party is a discretionary action by the trial court and subject to appellate review as part of an ultimate final judgment ․ the order itself is not appealable as such in isolation”  the novel question we must address is whether the district courts order is effectively unreviewable in light of the remandfirst we observe that the supreme court has strongly endorsed the following principle enunciated in the restatement second of judgments § although an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment and the determination is essential to the judgment relitigation of the issue in a subsequent action between the parties is not precluded in the following circumstances the party against whom preclusion is sought could not as a matter of law have obtained review of the judgment in the initial actionsee kircher  us at   sct at   here appellants cannot obtain review in federal court  section d prevents this court from reviewing the remand order itself  section  prevents this court from reviewing the district courts interlocutory order granting leave to amend   this courts prior decision in wr huff asset management co v kohlberg kravis roberts  fedappx   n  th cir did not address any of the merits issues currently before us and we do not reach the merits of those claims today  accordingly we discern no basis for the application of collateral estoppel in state court which therefore cannot be deemed to make the order effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment in state courtsecond in light of the lack of collateral estoppel we join the decisions of several of our sister circuits in finding no reason why the state appellate courts cannot review the propriety vel non of the district courts order on appeal from a final judgment  in powers the plaintiff filed an action in state court and the defendant removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction   fd at    the plaintiff then sought leave to amend the complaint to add an additional defendant under a relation back theory   the district court granted the motion  id  the amendment destroyed the courts diversity jurisdiction and the case was remanded to state court  id at    the third circuit statedbecause we are aware of no doctrine that would bar the state appellate court from reviewing the federal district courts interlocutory decision to allow the relation back amendment and because we do not believe that there is a right at stake the value of which effectively will be lost if the order is not immediately appealable we conclude that the third prong of the collateral order doctrine has not been metid at in price v j  h marsh  mclennan inc the second circuit reached a similar conclusion   fd  d cir   the plaintiff filed an action in state court and the defendant removed on the basis of diversity of citizenship  id at    several years after the initial removal the plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to add an additional plaintiff  id  the district court granted the motion concluded that joinder destroyed diversity and remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction  id at    defendants appealed   the second circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction  id at    the court concluded that the order allowing joinder was not final under the collateral order doctrine stating “we see no reason why the state appellate court cannot review the joinder decision on an appeal from a final judgment ․  nor can we discern any reason to excuse marsh from the usual requirement that it await appellate review of a final judgment to appeal the joinder ruling”  idwe see no reason on the facts before us why appellants cannot raise in the state appellate court all the merits issues they seek to present to us in this appeal   state courts “possess the authority absent a provision for exclusive federal jurisdiction to render binding judicial decisions that rest on their own interpretations of federal law”  asarco inc v kadish  us    sct    ledd     with respect to the merits issuewhether allowance of the amendment constituted a circumvention of slusathe supreme courts kircher opinion indicates that state courts are entirely competent to interpret and apply slusa   us at   sct at    with respect to the other merits issuesat least some of which turned in the district court on an application of the federal rules of civil procedurewe note that the collateral order doctrine asks only whether an order is “effectively unreviewable”   the federal rules of civil procedure and the alabama rules of civil procedure are “virtually identical”  ex parte maple chase co  sod   ala  in fact “a presumption arises in alabama state court that cases construing the federal rules are authority for construction of the alabama rules”  idappellants assert that while the remand itself is not reviewable it nonetheless provides a “final judgment” sufficient to render prior orders of the district court reviewable   in quackenbush v allstate insurance co  us    sct    ledd   the supreme court held that an order remanding on grounds of burford abstention is appealable under §   “when a district court remands a case to a state court the district court disassociates itself from the case entirely retaining nothing of the matter on the federal courts docket”   quackenbush  us at   sct at   see also fla polk county v prison health serv inc  fd   th cir “the district courts remand orders are final in the sense that they terminated the controversy in federal court”   assuming that the remand order itself is final appellants argument is nonetheless unavailing   the only issue on which the remand order is “final” is the remand itself   as noted above the merits issues can be reviewed in state court on appeal from final judgment   the policy of congress as expressed in § d and explicitly endorsed and “relentlessly” enforced by the supreme court is that litigation proceed to the merits under these circumstances  kircher  us at   sct at    therefore in light of the fact that review of the district courts order granting leave to amend is available in state court the order of remand cannot transform an otherwise interlocutory order into an appealable final order   see doleac ex rel doleac v michalson  fd   th cir “because we do not think congress intended the bar in § d to turn an otherwise noncollateral unreviewable interlocutory order into a collateral appealable order we conclude that this amendment does not meet the requirements of the third prong of the collateral order exception” appellants also point to the line of cases deriving from the supreme courts decision in waco which hold that the dismissal of a defendant and all the claims against it are appealable because they are no part of the case remanded to state court and if not set aside are conclusive upon the petitioner   see eg armstrong v ala power co  fd   th cir   however these cases are readily distinguishable  “a partial remand of a removed action constitutes in effect a severance of the part that is remanded from that which is retained  and orders entered as to the part of the action retained should be subject to the usual principles of appellate review”    moores federal practice  civil § app  see also powers  fd at    here no severable part of the action has been dismissed   all claims against the defendants were remanded to state court   the substituted plaintiffs and all the defendants are before the state court   the state courts have the competence and authority to determine if the fourth amended complaint was properly allowed at oral argument appellants expressed concern over a possible pingpong of the case between federal and state court   if the state court reverses the substitution order appellants claim they will again remove the action to federal court under  usc § pc  if the federal court persists in permitting substitution the case will again be remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction   appellants assert that such a vicious circle of litigation makes the substitution order effectively unreviewable   we disagreefor nothing in slusa gives the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over preclusion decisions   a covered action is removable if it is precluded and a defendant can enlist the federal judiciary to decide preclusion but a defendant can elect to leave a case where the plaintiff filed it and trust the state court an equally competent body see missouri pacific r co v fitzgerald  us    sct   led   to make the preclusion determinationkircher  us at   sct at    appellants have received an opportunity to litigate in a federal forum   the policy of congress is that appellants now utilize the “equally competent” state courts to resolve the claims against them  id  if the state courts determine that substitution was improper appellants may ask the state court to dismiss the action under slusaiii conclusionin sum we conclude that the remand order based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction is unreviewable under  usc § d  the district courts order granting leave to amend to substitute as plaintiffs fortysix individual note holders and relist robinson humphrey and murray devine as defendants is an unappealable interlocutory order   appellants may seek review of all the merits issues before us in the state courts   accordingly the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdictiondismissed footnotes   “the preclusion provision is often called a preemption provision  slusa however does not itself displace state law with federal law but makes some statelaw claims nonactionable through the class action device in federal as well as state court   see merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc v dabit  us    sct    ledd   ‘slusa does not deny any individual plaintiff or indeed any group of fewer than  plaintiffs the right to enforce any statelaw cause of action that may exist’”  kircher v putnam funds trust  us    sct    ledd     slusa states  “no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security  or  that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security”   usc § pb   in thermtron products inc v hermansdorfer the supreme court held that § d applies only to remand orders made on grounds authorized in  usc § c   us    sct    ledd   abrogated on other grounds by quackenbush v allstate ins co  us    sct    ledd     two grounds for removal are listed in § c   lack of subject matter jurisdiction  and  a defect in the removal process   see snapper inc v redan  fd   th cir   after huff substituted fortysix individual note holders as plaintiffs the district court concluded there was no basis under slusa for the preclusion of huffs state law claims   accordingly the court remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction   as a result § d bars appellate review of the remand order in this case   before the adoption of the federal rules of civil procedure in  “where an order adjudicated a separate and distinct claim ․ the judgment was final and could ‘be reviewed without awaiting the determination of the separate matter affecting only the parties to such particular controversy’ ”    james wm moore et al moores federal practice § app d ed quoting united states v river rouge co  us    sct    led    see also powers v southland corp  fd   n  d cir   flohr went on to hold that the appeal satisfied the finality rule because the proposed substitution of the united states for the federal employee would render the employee immune and an order denying immunity qualifies as a collateral order satisfying the finality rule   fd at    in bonner v city of prichard  fd  th cir this court adopted as binding precedent decisions of the fifth circuit including unit a panel decisions of that circuit handed down prior to october     see united states v todd  fd   th cir   accordingly both porter and taylor are binding precedent   “few problems are encountered in determining the appealability of orders dealing with party joinder   ordinarily orders granting or denying joinder or substitution are not final”  b wright miller  cooper federal practice and procedure  jurisdiction d §    for purposes of clarity we will refer to this type of preclusion as collateral estoppel in order to avoid confusion with the preclusion of certain state law claims under slusa   alabama state courts have also relied on the restatement second of judgments to establish principles of collateral estoppel   see eg lloyd noland found inc v healthsouth corp  sod   ala relying on restatement second of judgments §§    davis v hanson aggregates se inc  sod   ala relying on restatement second of judgments §    during the prior appeal this court considered the district courts denial of leave to amend on the grounds that the amendment   violated a prior judicial order   was untimely   was unduly burdensome on kkr  and  was a waste of judicial resources   we read our prior opinion as rejecting these and only these grounds for denying leave to amend  wr huff asset mgmt co v kohlberg kravis roberts  fedappx   n  th cir   because we are addressing the question whether the district courts merits rulings are effectively reviewable on appeal from the final judgment we need not and we do not express an opinion on the ability of the state trial court to consider the merits issues decided by the federal district court   but see kircher  us at   sct at    under the present circumstances both ala r civ p a and fedrcivp a state that amendment should be allowed “when justice so requires”  rules c a and  are virtually identical under both the alabama and federal rules of civil procedure   both quackenbush and florida polk county are distinguishable in that in each case the remand order was not based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction   in quackenbush the district courts “abstentionbased remand order did not fall into either category of remand order described in § c”  us at   sct at  and thus § d was inapplicable   in florida polk county the remand order was based on a forum selection clause and did not implicate § c or d   fd at    thus § c and d were simply inapplicable and the policy of congress expressed through § d was not operative in those cases   in contrast in armstrong the state court on remand lacked the competence to review the district courts dismissal of the united states and all the claims against it   this was so because such review would involve the interpretation of the suits in admiralty act but that act provided for exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts   we also have no jurisdiction to rule on appellants motion for judicial

represented by alexander william trautman  fulbright  jaworski llp  william j leone  fulbright  jaworski llp order r brooke jackson district judge this matter is before the court on plaintiffs motion to remand ecf no  the motion was filed on july   and is ripe for review as the defendants failed to file a response the court finds that the defendants failed to meet their burden to remove the case and that the case as pled was not properly removable the court therefore remands this case to state court procedural posture the plaintiffs filed their original complaint in the district court of denver on march   ecf no  the complaint included eight causes of action all of which arise solely under state law each of the entity defendants was served with process on or about april   the sole individual defendant mr baugues was served with process on may   the case was removed on june   within thirty  days of mr baugues having been served according to the removal notice the case was removed pursuant to diversity jurisdiction under  usc § a analysis the right to remove is contingent upon the existence of original jurisdiction in federal court see  usc § a federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and as such must have a statutory basis to exercise jurisdiction montoya v chao  fd   th cir  the party asserting jurisdiction has the burden of establishing its existence id citing kokkonen v guardian life ins co of am  us    as the defendants are invoking the courts jurisdiction in this case they bear the burden of establishing that the requirements for the exercise of diversity jurisdiction are present martin v franklin capital corp  fd   th cir  further defendants right to remove and plaintiffs right to choose his forum are not on equal footing for example unlike the rules applied when a plaintiff has filed suit in federal court with a claim that on its face satisfies the jurisdictional amount removal statutes are construed narrowly where plaintiff and defendant clash about jurisdiction uncertainties are resolved in favor of remand id at  quoting burns v windsor ins co  fd   th cir  diversity jurisdiction exists where there is complete diversity between the parties and the amount in controversy exceeds   usc § a none of the parties dispute that the amount in controversy far exceeds  in this case the question is whether the defendants have carried their burden of proof that there is complete diversity between the parties i find that they have not the notice of removal begins by asserting that there is complete diversity of citizenship notice of removal ecf no  at part ii in particular mr baugues states that all of the defendants are citizens of tennessee and that upon information and belief the plaintiffs are most likely citizens of the state of colorado id at ¶¶   emphasis added mr baugues bases this hypothesis on the fact that enserco energy llc and enserco midstream llc have offices located in denver colorado however a limited liability company is a citizen of the states of which its members are citizens    hale v mastersoft intl pty ltd  fsuppd   d colo  collecting cases only a corporation is deemed a citizen of the state in which it has its principal place of business see  usc § c mr baugues also acknowledges that it is possible that either or both of the plaintiffs is a citizen of the state of texas notice of removal ecf no  at ¶  mr baugues once again incorrectly bases his theory of the plaintiffs citizenship on the location of a limited liability companys principal place of business in particular mr baugues notes that that enserco energy is a subsidiary of twin eagle resource management llc which has its principal office in houston texas id notably mr baugues fails to discuss the citizenship of the members of the plaintiff limited liability companies at any point in the notice of removal the court therefore has no information whatsoever with which to determine the citizenship of the plaintiffs moving along mr baugues states that in the case of the four limited partnership defendants several of the limited partners are believed to be citizens of texas id at ¶  emphasis added mr baugues postulates the citizenship of the limited partners based on tax returns and other records affidavit of john p baugues jr ecf no  ¶¶     however there are a number of problems with this method for determining citizenship first it is unclear whether these addresses indicate individual residences or business addresses second even if the addresses were residential residence and citizenship are not coterminous see sun printing  publg assn v edwards  us    simply being a resident of a state does not render an individual a citizen of it instead to become a citizen of a state an individual must both set up a domicile in that state and intend to stay there id at  either without the other is insufficient id in this case no information has been provided nor a declaration made that these limited partners not only reside in texas but also intend to remain in texas furthermore there has been no discussion of the citizenship of the other limited partners though addresses for them have also been provided in exhibit a to mr baugues affidavit ecf no  ay  as such the court has no information whatsoever with which to determine the citizenship of the limited partners of the limited partnership defendants each of the four limited partnership defendants also has one general partner a limited liability company of which mr baugues is the sole member affidavit of john p baugues jr ecf no  at ¶¶     though mr baugues has not asserted that he is a citizen of any state he has declared that he resides primarily within tennessee and that he resides parttime in montana see id at ¶¶  because residence and citizenship are not coterminous the court can only assume without deciding that mr baugues is likely a citizen of tennessee or montana however without more information the court cannot determine mr baugues state of citizenship finally the three limited liability company defendants—dorchester land company llc dorchester mining company llc and dorchester coal processing llc—are all wholly owned subsidiaries of dorchester coal company lp affidavit of john p baugues jr ecf no  at ¶  at no point does mr baugues discuss the members of these limited liability companies or their citizenship instead he only notes that for each of them their principal office is located in knoxville tennessee as discussed earlier this information is irrelevant to the courts citizenship analysis once again the court has no information whatsoever with which to determine the citizenship of the members of the limited liability company defendants it is troubling to say the least that mr baugues did not fully investigate the citizenship of the partners of the limited partnership defendants and also completely failed to investigate the citizenship of the members of the limited liability company parties before filing this notice of removal even more confusing is his failure to declare his own citizenship the court cannot assert diversity jurisdiction over an action based on mere presumptions of citizenship further the complaint itself is of no assistance it does not list the citizenship of the members and partners of any of the entity parties or of mr baugues see complaint ecf no  at ¶¶  of course the pleading is perfectly sufficient without this information as the plaintiffs did not file this lawsuit in federal court and as such did not assert diversity jurisdiction over the action suffice to say the defendants have far from carried their burden in filing this notice of removal from what has been filed including the complaint the court has absolutely no information with which to determine the citizenship of any of the parties to this action and therefore must remand the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the plaintiffs ask this court to award them their costs and expenses including attorneys fees incurred in responding to the defendants notice of removal under  usc § c an order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses including attorney fees incurred as a result of the removal in deciding whether to award costs the court must ask whether there was an objectively reasonable basis for removal see martin v franklin capital corp  us    the court finds that there was no objectively reasonable basis for removal on the face of the notice the defendants appear to have been quite aware that there might not be diversity at the time of removal even going so far as to ask the court to dismiss four of the nonessential defendants in order to manufacture diversity see notice of removal ecf no  at ¶¶  more importantly the defendants conducted no investigation into the citizenship of any of the parties to the action before filing their notice of removal as such the plaintiffs request for costs and expenses including attorneys fees is granted the parties are to confer in good faith as to the reasonable costs and expenses should the parties be unable to come to an agreement as to the amount owed the determination of the reasonableness of the costs and fees will be reserved to the state court see hodach v caremark rx inc  fsuppd   nd ga  exercising its discretion in holding that the determination as to reasonableness of cost and fees would be reserved to the state court because litigating this case on dual tracks—the substantive issues in the superior court and the ancillary costs and expenses issue in this court—would be inefficient and would further delay the processing of the case order for the foregoing reasons plaintiffs motion to remand ecf no  is granted this case is hereby remanded to the state court the plaintiffs shall be awarded their just costs and actual expenses including attorneys fees pursuant to  usc § c footnotes  mr baugues serves as president of all of the entity defendants he is also the sole member of the limited liability companies that serve as the sole general partners of the four limited liability partnerships affidavit of john p baugues jr ecf no  at ¶¶      according to the plaintiffs these facts inevitably lead to the conclusion that mr baugues was aware of the pending action and had received constructive receipt of it through service on the entity defendants plaintiffs motion to remand ecf no  at  the plaintiffs argue that this constructive receipt renders removal untimely because the court decides this motion on other grounds it does not reach the merits of this argument  for purposes of diversity citizenship the court must look to the citizenship of all of a limited partnerships members including both the limited and general partners see carden v arkoma associates  us     when an entity consists of multiple tiers of ownership and control the entire structure must be considered for diversity purposes in other words when an entity is composed of multiple layers of constituent entities the citizenship determination requires an exploration of the citizenship of the constituent entities as far down as necessary to unravel fully the citizenship of the entity before the court burge v sunrise med us llc no cvpabmeh  wl  at  d colo dec   comment your name your email comments  characters remaining

difference between ltd partnership  llc by joe stone related articles comparison of ltd to llc is a  required for an llc how do i create an llc subsidiary a limited partnership and limited liability company are both types of business entities formed under state law they are similar in structure due to the fact that limited liability companies or llcs are designed to combine the benefits of both partnerships and corporations however there are important differences between the two business entities ready to start your llc start an llc online now personal liability protection an important reason why business owners form an llc or limited partnership is to protect their personal assets from businessrelated liabilities for an llc all the owners  called members  receive this liability protection however the owners of a limited partnership are not treated the same in this regard a limited partnership is required to have at least one general partner and one limited partner although the limited partner receives liability protection the general partner does not  he will be personally liable for the partnership’s obligations participation in business activity the owners of an llc can choose to have each member participate in the management of the business or designate the management responsibilities to one manager or managers in either case each member receives the same liability protection regardless of his level of participation in the llcs business activities this is not the case with a limited partnership in order to maintain liability protection a limited partner cannot participate in the partnerships business activity if such activity occurs the limited partner may become exposed to personal liability for the partnerships obligations tax treatment the benefit of forming a limited partnership is for the passthrough tax treatment that is the partnership is not taxed and the profits and losses of the partnership are shared among the partners and taxed only once an llc is similar in that it is often formed by business owners for the same tax benefit however for federal tax purposes an llc is treated as a disregarded entity this means that unlike a limited partnership the members of the llc can be choose to be taxed as a corporation rather than a partnership if that better suits the needs of the business case law differences limited partnerships have a much longer legal history than llcs with most state llc statutes having only been enacted since the early s this creates a significant difference between the case law that has developed regarding the judicial interpretation of limited partnership law versus the development of llc case law some uncertainty still exists regarding the extent to which principles of corporate law may be applied to llcs that could impact important aspects such as the member’s expectation of liability protection for llc members such issues will not be settled until there is sufficient case law
