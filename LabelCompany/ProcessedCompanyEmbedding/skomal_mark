bestbym ton may  format paperbackverified purchasei am a big fan of the for dummies series while i got some information out of this book i felt as of it was a bit outdated and the information wasnt sufficient enough i would recommend it to someone who is very new to the hobby but i wouldnt use it as your only source i would also recommend you read the book by a computer so you can look up the fish and equipment discussed since the book doesnt provide very good visualsread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starseasy read with a great balance of readability and technical information should be in any new marine aquarists librarybyroger a grimeson november  format paperbackverified purchaseim a new aquarist i bought  marine aquarium books from amazon i consider this one of the top books of the group and easily the easiest to read with a nice balance of information versus technical discussion not perfect but definitely the one that i ended up making up my list of things i still needed to do not overly technical as many of the books are easy read author is as good at writing as he is at being a marine biologist not perfect but close could use some updating on lights and other areas where the author either doesnt discuss the newest better technology or just barely covers it i wish marine life discussions included color photos instead of black and white drawings and more pictures of different marine life im already a big fan of the dummies books and i always buy one when im trying to learn something new this book is an excellent example of why everyone interested in new subject should by a dummies book as part of their knowledge investigationread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review
