military matters made him a very popular figure with both american political parties many democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters while many republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past republican administrations put forth as a potential democratic vice presidential nominee in the  us presidential election or even potentially replacing vice president dan quayle as the republican vice presidential nominee powell eventually declared himself a republican and began to campaign for republican candidates in  he was touted as a possible opponent of bill clinton in the  us presidential election possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in iowa and even leading new hampshire polls for the gop nomination but powell declined

secretary of state in  years  on september   powell was in lima peru meeting with president alejandro toledo and us ambassador john hamilton and attending the special session of the oas general assembly that subsequently adopted the interamerican democratic charter after the september  attacks powells job became of critical importance in managing americas relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the war on terrorism powell came under fire for his role in building the case for the  invasion of iraq in a press statement on february   he had said that sanctions against iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by saddam hussein as was the case in the days leading up to the persian gulf war powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of saddam preferring to continue a policy of containment however powell eventually agreed to go along with the bush administrations determination to remove saddam he had often clashed with others in the administration who were reportedly planning an iraq invasion even before the september  attacks an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar richard clarke in front of the  commission the main concession powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the iraq war was the involvement of the international community in the invasion as opposed to a unilateral approach he was also successful in persuading bush to take the case of iraq to the united nations and in moderating other initiatives powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign computergenerated image of an alleged mobile production facility for biological weapons presented by powell at the un security council on may   us and uk experts examined the trailers and declared they had nothing to do with biological weapons powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving a presentation to the united nations security council in february  powells chief role was to garner international support for a multinational coalition to mount the invasion to this end powell addressed a plenary session of the united nations security council on february   to argue in favor of military action citing numerous anonymous iraqi defectors powell asserted that there can be no doubt that saddam hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more powell also stated that there was no doubt in my mind that saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons most observers praised powells oratorical skills however britains channel  news reported soon afterwards that a uk intelligence dossier that powell had referred to as a fine paper during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by american graduate student ibrahim almarashi a  report by the iraq survey group concluded that the evidence that powell offered to support the allegation that the iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction wmds was inaccurate in an interview with charlie rose powell contended that prior to his un presentation he had merely four days to review the data concerning wmd in iraq a senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in powells speech state department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech some of the claims were taken out but others were left in such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery the administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence particularly what was singlesourced to the informant known as curveball powell later recounted how vice president dick cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech telling him youve got high poll ratings you can afford to lose a few points powells longtime aidedecamp and chief of staff from – colonel lawrence wilkerson later characterized cheneys view of powells mission as to go up there and sell it and well have moved forward a peg or two fall on your damn sword and kill yourself and ill be happy too in september  powell was asked about the speech during an interview with barbara walters and responded that it was a blot on his record he went on to say it will always be a part of my record it was painful its painful now wilkerson said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the american people in preparing powells erroneous testimony before the united nations security council because powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion such as donald rumsfeld and paul wolfowitz at times infighting among the powellled state department the rumsfeldled defense department and cheneys office had the effect of polarizing the administration on crucial issues such as what actions to take regarding iran and north korea secretary powell with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer after saddam hussein had been deposed powells new role was to once again establish a working international coalition this time to assist in the rebuilding of postwar iraq on september   powell testified before the senate governmental affairs committee acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his february  un presentation were wrong and that it was unlikely that any stockpiles of wmds would be found claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that what one person knew everyone else knew additionally powell has been critical of other instances of us foreign policy in the past such as its support for the  chilean coup détat from two separate interviews in  powell stated in one about the  event i cant justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time it was a different time there was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world it was a threat to the united states in another interview however he also simply stated with respect to your earlier comment about chile in the s and what happened with mr allende it is not a part of american history that were proud of powell announced his resignation as secretary of state on november   according to the washington post he had been asked to resign by the presidents chief of staff andrew card powell announced that he would stay on until the end of bushs first term or until his replacements confirmation by congress the following day bush nominated national security advisor condoleezza rice as powells successor news of powells leaving the administration spurred mixed reactions from politicians around the world — some upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the bush administration but others hoping for powells successor to wield more influence within the cabinet in midnovember powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that iran was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system the accusation came at the same time as the settlement of an agreement between iran the

expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of john r bolton as ambassador to the united nations but refrained from advising the senators to oppose bolton powell had clashed with bolton during bushs first term the decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to boltons chances of confirmation bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the senate powell with ban kimoon  on april   an opinion piece in the guardian by sidney blumenthal a former top aide to president bill clinton claimed that powell was in fact conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british blumenthal added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisors and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic

the first us war in iraq and us invasion of afghanistan the overthrow of the taliban regime in afghanistan following the september  attacks the hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation and the use of overwhelming military force powell was the subject of controversy in  when in a conversation with british foreign secretary jack straw he reportedly referred to

you can be a republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration and improving our education system and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country i don’t think theres anything inconsistent with this  views on the iraq war while powell was wary of a military solution he supported the decision to invade iraq after the bush administration concluded that diplomatic efforts had failed after his departure from the state department powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for american involvement in the iraq war at the  aspen ideas festival in colorado powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to president bush the consequences of going into an arab country and becoming the occupiers during this discussion he insisted that the us appeal to the united nations first but if diplomacy failed he would support the invasion i also had to say to him that you are the president you will have to make the ultimate judgment and if the judgment is this isnt working and we dont think it is going to solve the problem then if military action is undertaken im with you i support you in a  interview on cnn powell reiterated his support for the  decision to invade iraq in the context of his endorsement of barack obama stating my role has been very very straightforward i wanted to avoid a war the president bush agreed with me we tried to do that we couldnt get it through the un and when the president made the decision i supported that decision and ive never blinked from that ive never said i didnt support a decision to go to war powells position on the iraq war troop surge of  has been less consistent in december  he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the us military had enough troops to carry it out successfully he stated i am not persuaded that another surge of troops into baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence this civil war will work following his endorsement of barack obama in october  however powell praised general david petraeus and us troops as well as the iraqi government concluding that its starting to turn around by mid he had concluded a surge of us forces in iraq should have come sooner perhaps in late  throughout this period powell consistently argued that iraqi political progress was essential not just military force role in presidential election of  powell donated the maximum allowable amount to john mccains campaign in the summer of  and in early  his name was listed as a possible running mate for republican nominee mccains bid during the  us presidential election however on october   powell announced his endorsement of barack obama during a meet the press interview citing his ability to inspire because of the inclusive nature of his campaign because he is reaching out all across america because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities in addition to his style and substance he additionally referred to obama as a transformational figure powell further questioned mccains judgment in appointing sarah palin as the vice presidential candidate stating that despite the fact that she is admired now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks i dont believe shes ready to be president of the united states which is the job of the vice president he said that obamas choice for vicepresident joe biden was ready to be president he also added that he was troubled by the false intimations that obama was muslim powell stated that obama is a christian—hes always been a christian but the really right answer is what if he is is there something wrong with being a muslim in this country the answers no thats not america powell then mentioned kareem rashad sultan khan a muslim american soldier in the us army who served and died in the iraq war he later stated over the last seven weeks the approach of the republican party has become narrower and narrower  i look at these kind of approaches to the campaign and they trouble me powell concluded his sunday morning talk show comments it isnt easy for me to disappoint sen mccain in the way that i have this morning and i regret that  i think we need a transformational figure i think we need a president who is a generational change and thats why im supporting barack obama not out of any lack of respect or admiration for sen john mccain later in a december   cnn interview with fareed zakaria powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign palin pushed the republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it views on the obama administration in a july  cnn interview with john king powell expressed concern over president obama growing the size of the federal government and the size of the federal budget deficit in september  he criticized the obama administration for not focusing like a razor blade on the economy and job creation powell reiterated that

military matters made him a very popular figure with both american political parties many democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters while many republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past republican administrations put forth as a potential democratic vice presidential nominee in the  us presidential election or even potentially replacing vice president dan quayle as the republican vice presidential nominee powell eventually declared himself a republican and began to campaign for republican candidates in  he was touted as a possible opponent of bill clinton in the  us presidential election possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in iowa and even leading new hampshire polls for the gop nomination but powell declined

secretary of state in  years  on september   powell was in lima peru meeting with president alejandro toledo and us ambassador john hamilton and attending the special session of the oas general assembly that subsequently adopted the interamerican democratic charter after the september  attacks powells job became of critical importance in managing americas relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the war on terrorism powell came under fire for his role in building the case for the  invasion of iraq in a press statement on february   he had said that sanctions against iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by saddam hussein as was the case in the days leading up to the persian gulf war powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of saddam preferring to continue a policy of containment however powell eventually agreed to go along with the bush administrations determination to remove saddam he had often clashed with others in the administration who were reportedly planning an iraq invasion even before the september  attacks an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar richard clarke in front of the  commission the main concession powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the iraq war was the involvement of the international community in the invasion as opposed to a unilateral approach he was also successful in persuading bush to take the case of iraq to the united nations and in moderating other initiatives powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign computergenerated image of an alleged mobile production facility for biological weapons presented by powell at the un security council on may   us and uk experts examined the trailers and declared they had nothing to do with biological weapons powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving a presentation to the united nations security council in february  powells chief role was to garner international support for a multinational coalition to mount the invasion to this end powell addressed a plenary session of the united nations security council on february   to argue in favor of military action citing numerous anonymous iraqi defectors powell asserted that there can be no doubt that saddam hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more powell also stated that there was no doubt in my mind that saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons most observers praised powells oratorical skills however britains channel  news reported soon afterwards that a uk intelligence dossier that powell had referred to as a fine paper during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by american graduate student ibrahim almarashi a  report by the iraq survey group concluded that the evidence that powell offered to support the allegation that the iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction wmds was inaccurate in an interview with charlie rose powell contended that prior to his un presentation he had merely four days to review the data concerning wmd in iraq a senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in powells speech state department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech some of the claims were taken out but others were left in such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery the administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence particularly what was singlesourced to the informant known as curveball powell later recounted how vice president dick cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech telling him youve got high poll ratings you can afford to lose a few points powells longtime aidedecamp and chief of staff from – colonel lawrence wilkerson later characterized cheneys view of powells mission as to go up there and sell it and well have moved forward a peg or two fall on your damn sword and kill yourself and ill be happy too in september  powell was asked about the speech during an interview with barbara walters and responded that it was a blot on his record he went on to say it will always be a part of my record it was painful its painful now wilkerson said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the american people in preparing powells erroneous testimony before the united nations security council because powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion such as donald rumsfeld and paul wolfowitz at times infighting among the powellled state department the rumsfeldled defense department and cheneys office had the effect of polarizing the administration on crucial issues such as what actions to take regarding iran and north korea secretary powell with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer after saddam hussein had been deposed powells new role was to once again establish a working international coalition this time to assist in the rebuilding of postwar iraq on september   powell testified before the senate governmental affairs committee acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his february  un presentation were wrong and that it was unlikely that any stockpiles of wmds would be found claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that what one person knew everyone else knew additionally powell has been critical of other instances of us foreign policy in the past such as its support for the  chilean coup détat from two separate interviews in  powell stated in one about the  event i cant justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time it was a different time there was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world it was a threat to the united states in another interview however he also simply stated with respect to your earlier comment about chile in the s and what happened with mr allende it is not a part of american history that were proud of powell announced his resignation as secretary of state on november   according to the washington post he had been asked to resign by the presidents chief of staff andrew card powell announced that he would stay on until the end of bushs first term or until his replacements confirmation by congress the following day bush nominated national security advisor condoleezza rice as powells successor news of powells leaving the administration spurred mixed reactions from politicians around the world — some upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the bush administration but others hoping for powells successor to wield more influence within the cabinet in midnovember powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that iran was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system the accusation came at the same time as the settlement of an agreement between iran the

expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of john r bolton as ambassador to the united nations but refrained from advising the senators to oppose bolton powell had clashed with bolton during bushs first term the decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to boltons chances of confirmation bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the senate powell with ban kimoon  on april   an opinion piece in the guardian by sidney blumenthal a former top aide to president bill clinton claimed that powell was in fact conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british blumenthal added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisors and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic

military force these views are described in detail in the autobiography my american journey the powell doctrine as the views became known was a central component of us policy in the persian gulf war the first us war in iraq and us invasion of afghanistan the overthrow of the taliban regime in afghanistan following the september  attacks the hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation and the use of overwhelming military force powell was the subject of controversy in  when in a conversation with british foreign secretary jack straw he reportedly referred to neoconservatives within the bush administration as fucking crazies in addition to being reported in the press although the expletive was generally censored in the us press the quotation was used by

you can be a republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration and improving our education system and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country i don’t think theres anything inconsistent with this  views on the iraq war while powell was wary of a military solution he supported the decision to invade iraq after the bush administration concluded that diplomatic efforts had failed after his departure from the state department powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for american involvement in the iraq war at the  aspen ideas festival in colorado powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to president bush the consequences of going into an arab country and becoming the occupiers during this discussion he insisted that the us appeal to the united nations first but if diplomacy failed he would support the invasion i also had to say to him that you are the president you will have to make the ultimate judgment and if the judgment is this isnt working and we dont think it is going to solve the problem then if military action is undertaken im with you i support you in a  interview on cnn powell reiterated his support for the  decision to invade iraq in the context of his endorsement of barack obama stating my role has been very very straightforward i wanted to avoid a war the president bush agreed with me we tried to do that we couldnt get it through the un and when the president made the decision i supported that decision and ive never blinked from that ive never said i didnt support a decision to go to war powells position on the iraq war troop surge of  has been less consistent in december  he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the us military had enough troops to carry it out successfully he stated i am not persuaded that another surge of troops into baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence this civil war will work following his endorsement of barack obama in october  however powell praised general david petraeus and us troops as well as the iraqi government concluding that its starting to turn around by mid he had concluded a surge of us forces in iraq should have come sooner perhaps in late  throughout this period powell consistently argued that iraqi political progress was essential not just military force role in presidential election of  powell donated the maximum allowable amount to john mccains campaign in the summer of  and in early  his name was listed as a possible running mate for republican nominee mccains bid during the  us presidential election however on october   powell announced his endorsement of barack obama during a meet the press interview citing his ability to inspire because of the inclusive nature of his campaign because he is reaching out all across america because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities in addition to his style and substance he additionally referred to obama as a transformational figure powell further questioned mccains judgment in appointing sarah palin as the vice presidential candidate stating that despite the fact that she is admired now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks i dont believe shes ready to be president of the united states which is the job of the vice president he said that obamas choice for vicepresident joe biden was ready to be president he also added that he was troubled by the false intimations that obama was muslim powell stated that obama is a christian—hes always been a christian but the really right answer is what if he is is there something wrong with being a muslim in this country the answers no thats not america powell then mentioned kareem rashad sultan khan a muslim american soldier in the us army who served and died in the iraq war he later stated over the last seven weeks the approach of the republican party has become narrower and narrower  i look at these kind of approaches to the campaign and they trouble me powell concluded his sunday morning talk show comments it isnt easy for me to disappoint sen mccain in the way that i have this morning and i regret that  i think we need a transformational figure i think we need a president who is a generational change and thats why im supporting barack obama not out of any lack of respect or admiration for sen john mccain later in a december   cnn interview with fareed zakaria powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign palin pushed the republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it views on the obama administration in a july  cnn interview with john king powell expressed concern over president obama growing the size of the federal government and the size of the federal budget deficit in september  he criticized the obama administration for not focusing like a razor blade on the economy and job creation powell reiterated that

vice president joe biden next month as additional reason for his endorsement powell cited the changing positions and perceived lack of thoughtfulness of mitt romney on foreign affairs and a concern

matters while many republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past republican administrations put forth as a potential democratic vice presidential nominee in the  us presidential election or even potentially replacing vice president dan quayle as the republican vice presidential nominee powell eventually declared himself a republican and began to campaign for republican candidates in  he was touted as a possible opponent of bill clinton in the  us presidential election possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in iowa and even leading new hampshire polls for the gop nomination but powell declined citing a lack of passion for politics powell defeated clinton – in a hypothetical matchup proposed to voters in the exit polls conducted on

special session of the oas general assembly that subsequently adopted the interamerican democratic charter after the september  attacks powells job became of critical importance in managing americas relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the war on terrorism powell came under fire for his role in building the case for the  invasion of iraq in a press statement on february   he had said that sanctions against iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by saddam hussein as was the case in the days leading up to the persian gulf war powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of saddam preferring to continue a policy of containment however powell eventually agreed to go along with the bush administrations determination to remove saddam he had often clashed with others in the administration who were reportedly planning an iraq invasion even before the september  attacks an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar richard clarke in front of the  commission the main concession powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the iraq war was the involvement of the international community in the invasion as opposed to a unilateral approach he was also successful in persuading bush to take the case of iraq to the united nations and in moderating other initiatives powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign computergenerated image of an alleged mobile production facility for biological weapons presented by powell at the un security council on may   us and uk experts examined the trailers and declared they had nothing to do with biological weapons powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving a presentation to the united nations security council in february  powells chief role was to garner international support for a multinational coalition to mount the invasion to this end powell addressed a plenary session of the united nations security council on february   to argue in favor of military action citing numerous anonymous iraqi defectors powell asserted that there can be no doubt that saddam hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more powell also stated that there was no doubt in my mind that saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons most observers praised powells oratorical skills however britains channel  news reported soon afterwards that a uk intelligence dossier that powell had referred to as a fine paper during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by american graduate student ibrahim almarashi a  report by the iraq survey group concluded that the evidence that powell offered to support the allegation that the iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction wmds was inaccurate in an interview with charlie rose powell contended that prior to his un presentation he had merely four days to review the data concerning wmd in iraq a senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in powells speech state department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech some of the claims were taken out but others were left in such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery the administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence particularly what was singlesourced to the informant known as curveball powell later recounted how vice president dick cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech telling him youve got high poll ratings you can afford to lose a few points powells longtime aidedecamp and chief of staff from – colonel lawrence wilkerson later characterized cheneys view of powells mission as to go up there and sell it and well have moved forward a peg or two fall on your damn sword and kill yourself and ill be happy too in september  powell was asked about the speech during an interview with barbara walters and responded that it was a blot on his record he went on to say it will always be a part of my record it was painful its painful now wilkerson said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the american people in preparing powells erroneous testimony before the united nations security council because powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion such as donald rumsfeld and paul wolfowitz at times infighting among the powellled state department the rumsfeldled defense department and cheneys office had the effect of polarizing the administration on crucial issues such as what actions to take regarding iran and north korea secretary powell with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer after saddam hussein had been deposed powells new role was to once again establish a working international coalition this time to assist in the rebuilding of postwar iraq on september   powell testified before the senate governmental affairs committee acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his february  un presentation were wrong and that it was unlikely that any stockpiles of wmds would be found claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that what one person knew everyone else knew additionally powell has been critical of other instances of us foreign policy in the past such as its support for the  chilean coup détat from two separate interviews in  powell stated in one about the  event i cant justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time it was a different time there was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world it was a threat to the united states in another interview however he also simply stated with respect to your earlier comment about chile in the s and what happened with mr allende it is not a part of american history that were proud of powell announced his resignation as secretary of state on

to oppose bolton powell had clashed with bolton during bushs first term the decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to boltons chances of confirmation bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the senate powell with ban kimoon  on april   an opinion piece in the guardian by sidney blumenthal a former top aide to president bill clinton claimed that powell was in fact conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british blumenthal added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a

central component of us policy in the persian gulf war the first us war in iraq and us invasion of afghanistan the overthrow of the taliban regime in afghanistan following the september  attacks the

party needs me more than the democratic party needs me and you can be a republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration and improving our education system and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country i don’t think theres anything inconsistent with this  views on the iraq war while powell was wary of a military solution he

action is undertaken im with you i support you in a  interview on cnn powell reiterated his support for the  decision to invade iraq in the context of his endorsement of barack obama stating my role has been very very straightforward i wanted to avoid a war the president bush agreed with me we tried to do that we couldnt get it through the un and when the president made the decision i supported that decision and ive never blinked from that ive never said i didnt support a decision to go to war powells position on the iraq war troop surge of  has been less consistent in december  he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the us military had enough troops to carry it out successfully he stated i am not persuaded that another surge of troops into baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence this civil war will work following his endorsement of barack obama in october  however powell praised general david petraeus and us troops as well

to disappoint sen mccain in the way that i have this morning and i regret that  i think we need a transformational figure i think we need a president who is a generational change and thats why im supporting barack obama not out of any lack of respect or admiration for sen john mccain later in a december   cnn interview with fareed zakaria powell reiterated his belief that during the last few

potential presidential candidate powells experience in military matters made him a very popular figure with both american political parties many democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters while many republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past republican administrations put forth as a potential democratic vice presidential nominee in the  us presidential election or even potentially replacing vice president dan quayle as the republican vice presidential nominee powell eventually declared himself a republican and began to campaign for republican candidates in  he was touted as a possible opponent of bill clinton in the  us presidential election possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in iowa and even leading new hampshire polls for the gop nomination but powell declined citing a lack of passion for politics powell defeated clinton – in a hypothetical matchup proposed to voters in the exit polls conducted on election day despite not standing in the race powell won the republican new hampshire vicepresidential primary on writein votes in  powell founded americas promise with the objective of helping

the republican nomination powell endorsed him for president and spoke at the  republican national convention bush eventually won and powell was appointed secretary of state in the electoral college vote count of  powell received three votes from faithless electors from washington secretary of state powell national security advisor condoleezza rice and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld listen to president george w bush speak as secretary of state in the bush administration powell was perceived as moderate powell was unanimously confirmed by the united states senate over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other us secretary of state in  years  on september   powell was in lima peru meeting with president alejandro toledo and us ambassador john hamilton and attending the special session of the oas general assembly that subsequently adopted the interamerican democratic charter after the september  attacks powells job became of critical importance in managing americas relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the war on terrorism powell came under fire for his role in building the case for the  invasion of iraq in a press statement on february   he had said that sanctions against iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by saddam hussein as was the case in the days leading up to the persian gulf war powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of saddam preferring to continue a policy of containment however powell eventually agreed to go along with the bush administrations determination to remove saddam he had often clashed with others in the administration who were reportedly planning an iraq invasion even before the september  attacks an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar richard clarke in front of the  commission the main concession powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the iraq war was the involvement of the international community in the invasion as opposed to a unilateral approach he was also successful in persuading bush to take the case of iraq to the united nations and in moderating other initiatives powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign computergenerated image of an alleged mobile production facility for biological weapons presented by powell at the un security council on may   us and uk experts examined the trailers and declared they had nothing to do with biological weapons powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving a presentation to the united nations security council in february  powells chief role was to garner international support for a multinational coalition to mount the invasion to this end powell addressed a plenary session of the united nations security council on february   to argue in favor of military action citing numerous anonymous iraqi defectors powell asserted that there can be no doubt that saddam hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more powell also stated that there was no doubt in my mind that saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons most observers praised powells oratorical skills however britains channel  news reported soon afterwards that a uk intelligence dossier that powell had referred to as a fine paper during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by american graduate student ibrahim almarashi a  report by the iraq survey group concluded that the evidence that powell offered to support the allegation that the iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction wmds was inaccurate in an interview with charlie rose powell contended that prior to his un presentation he had merely four days to review the data concerning wmd in iraq a senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in powells speech state department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech some of the claims were taken out but others were left in such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery the administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence particularly what was singlesourced to the informant known as curveball powell later recounted how vice president dick cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech telling him youve got high poll ratings you can afford to lose a few points powells longtime aidedecamp and chief of staff from – colonel lawrence wilkerson later characterized cheneys view of powells mission as to go up there and sell it and well have moved forward a peg or two fall on your damn sword and kill yourself and ill be happy too in september  powell was asked about the speech during an interview with barbara walters and responded that it was a blot on his record he went on to say it will always be a part of my record it was painful its painful now wilkerson said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the american people in preparing powells erroneous testimony before the united nations security council because powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion such as donald rumsfeld and paul wolfowitz at times infighting among the powellled state department the rumsfeldled defense department and cheneys office had the effect of polarizing the administration on crucial issues such as what actions to take regarding iran and north korea secretary powell with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer after saddam hussein had been deposed powells new role was to once again establish a working international coalition this time to assist in the rebuilding of postwar iraq on september   powell testified before the senate governmental affairs committee acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his february  un presentation were wrong and that it was unlikely that any stockpiles of wmds would be found claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that what one person knew everyone else knew additionally powell has been critical of other instances of us foreign policy in the past such as its support for the  chilean coup détat from two separate interviews in  powell stated in one about the  event i cant justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time it was a different time there was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world it was a threat to the united states in another interview however he also simply stated with respect to your earlier comment about chile in the s and what happened with mr allende it is not a part of american history that were proud of powell announced his resignation as secretary of state on november   according to the washington post he had been asked to resign by the presidents chief of staff andrew card powell announced that he would stay on until the end of bushs first term or until his replacements confirmation by congress the following day bush nominated national security advisor condoleezza rice as powells successor news of powells leaving the administration spurred mixed reactions from politicians around the world — some upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the bush administration but others hoping for powells successor to wield more influence within the cabinet in midnovember powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that iran was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system the accusation came at the same time as the settlement of an agreement between iran the iaea and the european union on december   powell rang in the new year by pressing a button in times square with new york city mayor michael bloomberg to initiate the ball drop and  second countdown ushering in the year  he appeared on the networks that were broadcasting new years eve specials and talked about this honor as well as being a native of new york city life after diplomatic service after retiring from the role of secretary of state powell returned to private life in april  he was privately telephoned by republican senators lincoln chafee and chuck hagel at which time powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of john r bolton as ambassador to the united nations but refrained from advising the senators to oppose bolton powell had clashed with bolton during bushs first term the decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to boltons chances of confirmation bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the senate powell with ban kimoon  on april   an opinion piece in the guardian by sidney blumenthal a former top aide to president bill clinton claimed that powell was in fact conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british blumenthal added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisors and other

by robert gates and admiral mike mullen in january  saying circumstances had changed external video booknotes interview with powell on my american journey january   cspan the vietnam war had a profound effect on powells views of the proper use of military force these views are described in detail in the autobiography my american journey the powell doctrine as the views became known was a central component of us policy in the persian gulf war the first us war in iraq and us invasion of afghanistan the overthrow of the taliban regime in afghanistan following the september  attacks the hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation and the use of overwhelming military force powell was the subject of controversy in  when in a conversation with british foreign secretary jack straw he reportedly referred to neoconservatives within the bush administration as fucking crazies in addition to being reported in the press although the expletive was generally censored in the us press the quotation was used by james naughtie in his book the accidental american tony blair and the presidency and by chris patten in his book cousins and strangers america

of our fight against terrorism powell endorsed president obama in  and again in  when asked why he is still a republican on meet the press he said i’m still a republican and i think the republican party needs me more than the democratic party needs me and you can be a republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration and improving our education system and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country i don’t think theres anything inconsistent with this  views on the iraq war while powell was wary of a military solution he supported the decision to invade iraq after the bush administration concluded that diplomatic efforts had failed after his departure from the state department powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for american involvement in the iraq war at the  aspen ideas festival in colorado powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to president bush the consequences of going into an arab country and becoming the occupiers during this discussion he insisted that the us appeal to the united nations first but if diplomacy failed he would support the invasion i also had to say to him that you are the president you will have to make the ultimate judgment and if the judgment is this isnt working and we dont think it is going to solve the problem then if military action is undertaken im with you i support you in a  interview on cnn powell reiterated his support for the  decision to invade iraq in the context of his endorsement of barack obama stating my role has been very very straightforward i wanted to avoid a war the president bush agreed with me we tried to do that we couldnt get it through the un and when the president made the decision i supported that decision and ive never blinked from that ive never said i didnt support a decision to go to war powells position on the iraq war troop surge of  has been less consistent in december  he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the us military had enough troops to carry it out successfully he stated i am not persuaded that another surge of troops into baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence this civil war will work following his endorsement of barack obama in october  however powell praised general david petraeus and us troops as well as the iraqi government concluding that its starting to turn around by mid he had concluded a surge of us forces in iraq should have come sooner perhaps in late  throughout this period powell consistently argued that iraqi political progress was essential not just military force role in presidential election of  powell donated the maximum allowable amount to john mccains campaign in the summer of  and in early  his name was listed as a possible running mate for republican nominee mccains bid during the  us presidential election however on october   powell announced his endorsement of barack obama during a meet the press interview citing his ability to inspire because of the inclusive nature of his campaign because he is reaching out all across america because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities in addition to his style and substance he additionally referred to obama as a transformational figure powell further questioned mccains judgment in appointing sarah palin as the vice presidential candidate stating that despite the fact that she is admired now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks i dont believe shes ready to be president of the united states which is the job of the vice president he said that obamas choice for vicepresident joe biden was ready to be president he also added that he was troubled by the false intimations that obama was muslim powell stated that obama is a christian—hes always been a christian but the really right answer is what if he is is there something wrong with being a muslim in this country the answers no thats not america powell then mentioned kareem rashad sultan khan a muslim american soldier in the us army who served and died in the iraq war he later stated over the last seven weeks the approach of the republican party has become narrower and narrower  i look at these kind of approaches to the campaign and they trouble me powell concluded his sunday morning talk show comments it isnt easy for me to disappoint sen mccain in the way that i have this morning and i regret that  i think we need a transformational figure i think we need a president who is a generational change and thats why im supporting barack obama not out of any lack of respect or admiration for sen john mccain later in a december   cnn interview with fareed zakaria powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign palin pushed the republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it views on the obama administration in a july  cnn interview with john king powell

a razor blade on the economy and job creation powell reiterated that obama was a transformational figure in a video that aired on cnncom in november  colin powell said in reference to barack obama

matters while many republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past republican administrations put forth as a potential democratic vice presidential nominee in the  us presidential election or even potentially replacing vice president dan quayle as the republican vice presidential nominee powell eventually declared himself a republican and began to campaign for

tenure he traveled less than any other us secretary of state in  years  on september   powell was in lima peru meeting with president alejandro toledo and us ambassador john hamilton and attending the special session of the oas general assembly that subsequently adopted the interamerican democratic charter after the september  attacks powells job became of critical importance in managing americas relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the war on terrorism powell came under fire for his role in building the case for the  invasion of iraq in a press statement on february   he had said that sanctions against iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by saddam hussein as was the case in the days leading up to the persian gulf war powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of saddam preferring to continue a policy of containment however powell eventually agreed to go along with the bush administrations determination to remove saddam he had often clashed with others in the administration who were reportedly planning an iraq invasion even before the september  attacks an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar richard clarke in front of the  commission the main concession powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the iraq war was the involvement of the international community in the invasion as opposed to a unilateral approach he was also successful in persuading bush to take the case of iraq to the united nations and in moderating other initiatives powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign computergenerated image of an alleged mobile production facility for biological weapons presented by powell at the un security council on may   us and uk experts examined the trailers and declared they had nothing to do with biological weapons powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving a presentation to the united nations security council in february  powells chief role was to garner international support for a multinational coalition to mount the invasion to this end powell addressed a plenary session of the united nations security council on february   to argue in favor of military action citing numerous anonymous iraqi defectors powell asserted that there can be no doubt that saddam hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more powell also stated that there was no doubt in my mind that saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons most observers praised powells oratorical skills however britains channel  news reported soon afterwards that a uk intelligence dossier that powell had referred to as a fine paper during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by american graduate student ibrahim almarashi a  report by the iraq survey group concluded that the evidence that powell offered to support the allegation that the iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction wmds was inaccurate in an interview with charlie rose powell contended that prior to his un presentation he had merely four days to review the data concerning wmd in iraq a senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in powells speech state department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech some of the claims were taken out but others were left in such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery the administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence particularly what was singlesourced to the informant known as curveball powell later recounted how vice president dick cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech telling him youve got high poll ratings you can afford to lose a few points powells longtime aidedecamp and chief of staff from – colonel lawrence wilkerson later characterized cheneys view of powells mission as to go up there and sell it and well have moved forward a peg or two fall on your damn sword and kill yourself and ill be happy too in september  powell was asked about the speech during an interview with barbara walters and responded that it was a blot on his record he went on to say it will always be a part of my record it was painful its painful now wilkerson said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the american people in preparing powells erroneous testimony before the united nations security council because powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion such as donald rumsfeld and paul wolfowitz at times infighting among the powellled state department the rumsfeldled defense department and cheneys office had the effect of polarizing the administration on crucial issues such as what actions to take regarding iran and north korea secretary powell with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer after saddam hussein had been deposed powells new role was to once again establish a working international coalition this time to assist in the rebuilding of postwar iraq on september   powell testified before the senate governmental affairs committee acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his february  un presentation were wrong and that it was unlikely that any stockpiles of wmds would be found claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that what one person knew everyone else knew additionally powell has been critical of other instances of us foreign policy in the past such as its support for the  chilean coup détat from two separate interviews in  powell stated in one about the  event i cant justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time it was a different time there was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world it was a threat to the united states in another interview however he also simply stated with respect to your earlier comment about chile in the s and what happened with mr allende it is not a part of american history that were proud of powell announced his resignation as secretary of state on

reactions from politicians around the world — some upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the bush administration but others hoping for powells successor to wield more influence within the cabinet in midnovember powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that iran was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system the accusation came at the same time as

chafee and chuck hagel at which time powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of john r bolton as ambassador to the united nations but refrained from advising the senators to oppose bolton powell had clashed with bolton during bushs first term the decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to boltons chances of confirmation bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the senate powell with ban kimoon  on april   an opinion piece in the guardian by sidney blumenthal a former top aide to president bill clinton claimed that powell was in fact conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british blumenthal added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisors and other

profound effect on powells views of the proper use of military force these views are described in detail in the autobiography my american journey the powell doctrine as the views became known was a central component of us policy in the persian gulf war the first us war in iraq and us invasion of afghanistan the overthrow of the taliban regime in afghanistan following the september  attacks the hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation and the use of overwhelming military force powell was the subject of controversy in  when in a conversation with british foreign secretary jack straw he reportedly referred to neoconservatives within the bush administration as fucking crazies in addition to being reported in the press although the expletive was generally

party needs me more than the democratic party needs me and you can be a republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration and improving our education system and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country i don’t think theres anything inconsistent with this  views on the iraq war while powell was wary of a military solution he supported the decision to invade iraq after the bush administration concluded that diplomatic efforts had failed after his departure from the state department powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for american involvement in the iraq war at the  aspen ideas festival in colorado powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to president bush the consequences of going into an arab country and becoming the occupiers during this discussion he insisted that the us appeal to the united nations first but if diplomacy failed he would support the invasion i also had to say to him that you are the president you will have to make the ultimate judgment and if the judgment is this isnt working and we dont think it is going to solve the problem then if military action is undertaken im with you i support you in a  interview on cnn powell reiterated his support for the  decision to invade iraq in the context of his endorsement of barack obama stating my role has been very very straightforward i wanted to avoid a war the president bush agreed with me we tried to do that we couldnt get it through the un and when the president made the decision i supported that decision and ive never blinked from that ive never said i didnt support a decision to go to war powells position on the iraq war troop surge of  has been less consistent in december  he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the us military had enough troops to carry it out successfully he stated i am not persuaded that another surge of troops into baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence this civil war will work following his endorsement of barack obama in october  however powell praised general david petraeus and us troops as well as the iraqi government concluding that its starting to turn around by mid he had concluded a surge of us forces in iraq should have come sooner perhaps in late  throughout this period powell consistently argued that iraqi political progress was essential not just military force role in presidential election of  powell donated the maximum allowable amount to john mccains campaign in the

barack obama during a meet the press interview citing his ability to inspire because of the inclusive nature of his campaign because he is reaching out all across america because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities in addition to his style and substance he additionally referred to obama as a transformational figure powell further questioned mccains judgment in appointing sarah palin as the vice presidential candidate stating that despite the fact that she is admired now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks i dont believe shes ready to be president of the united states which is the job of the vice president he said that obamas choice for vicepresident joe biden was ready to be president he also added that he was troubled by the false intimations that obama was muslim powell stated that obama is a christian—hes always been a christian but the really right answer is what if he is is there something wrong with being a muslim in this country the answers no thats not america powell then mentioned kareem rashad sultan khan a muslim american soldier in the us army who served and died in the iraq war he later stated over the last seven weeks the approach of the republican party has become narrower and narrower  i look at these kind of approaches to the campaign and they trouble me powell concluded his sunday morning talk show comments it isnt easy for me to disappoint sen mccain in the way that i have this morning and i regret that  i think we need a transformational figure i think we need a president who is a generational change and thats why im supporting barack obama not out of any lack of respect or admiration for sen john mccain later in a december   cnn interview with fareed zakaria powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign palin pushed the republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it views on the obama administration in a july  cnn interview with john king powell

potential presidential candidate powells experience in military matters made him a very popular figure with both american political parties many democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters while many republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past republican administrations put forth as a potential democratic vice presidential nominee in the  us presidential election or even potentially replacing vice president dan quayle as the republican vice presidential nominee powell eventually declared himself a republican and began to campaign for republican candidates in  he was touted as a possible opponent of bill clinton in the  us presidential election possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in iowa and even leading new hampshire polls for the gop nomination but powell declined citing a lack of passion for politics powell defeated clinton – in a hypothetical matchup proposed to voters in the exit polls conducted on election day despite not standing in the race powell won the republican new hampshire vicepresidential primary on writein votes in  powell founded americas promise with the objective of helping children from all socioeconomic sectors that same year saw the establishment of the colin l powell center for leadership and service the mission of the center is to prepare new generations of publicly engaged leaders from populations previously underrepresented in public service and policy circles to build a strong culture of civic engagement at city college and to mobilize campus resources to meet pressing community needs and serve the public good  powell was mentioned as a potential candidate in the  us presidential election but decided against running once texas governor george w bush secured the republican nomination powell endorsed him for president and spoke at the  republican national convention bush eventually won and powell was appointed secretary of state in the electoral college vote count of  powell received three votes from faithless electors from washington secretary of state powell national security advisor condoleezza rice and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld listen to president george w bush speak as secretary of state in the bush administration powell was perceived as moderate powell was unanimously confirmed by the united states senate over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other us secretary of state in  years  on september   powell was in lima peru meeting with president alejandro toledo and us ambassador john hamilton and attending the special session of the oas general assembly that subsequently adopted the interamerican democratic charter after the september  attacks powells job became of critical importance in managing americas relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the war on terrorism powell came under fire for his role in building the case for the  invasion of iraq in a press statement on february   he had said that sanctions against iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by saddam hussein as was the case in the days leading up to the persian gulf war powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of saddam preferring to continue a policy of containment however powell eventually agreed to go along with the bush administrations determination to remove saddam he had often clashed with others in the administration who were reportedly planning an iraq invasion even before the september  attacks an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar richard clarke in front of the  commission the main concession powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the iraq war was the involvement of the international community in the invasion as opposed to a unilateral approach he was also successful in persuading bush to take the case of iraq to the united nations and in moderating other initiatives powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign computergenerated image of an alleged mobile production facility for biological weapons presented by powell at the un security council on may   us and uk experts examined the trailers and declared they had nothing to do with biological weapons powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving a presentation to the united nations security council in february  powells chief role was to garner international support for a multinational coalition to mount the invasion to this end powell addressed a plenary session of the united nations security council on february   to argue in favor of military action citing numerous anonymous iraqi defectors powell asserted that there can be no doubt that saddam hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more powell also stated that there was no doubt in my mind that saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons most observers praised powells oratorical skills however britains channel  news reported soon afterwards that a uk intelligence dossier that powell had referred to as a fine paper during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by american graduate student ibrahim almarashi a  report by the iraq survey group concluded that the evidence that powell offered to support the allegation that the iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction wmds was inaccurate in an interview with charlie rose powell contended that prior to his un presentation he had merely four days to review the data concerning wmd in iraq a senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in powells speech state department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech some of the claims were taken out but others were left in such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery the administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence particularly what was singlesourced to the informant known as curveball powell later recounted how vice president dick cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech telling him youve got high poll ratings you can afford to lose a few points powells longtime aidedecamp and chief of staff from – colonel lawrence wilkerson later characterized cheneys view of powells mission as to go up there and sell it and well have moved forward a peg or two fall on your damn sword and kill yourself and ill be happy too in september

profound effect on powells views of the proper use of military force these views are described in detail in the autobiography my american journey the powell doctrine as the views became known was a central component of us policy in the persian gulf war the first us war in iraq and us invasion of afghanistan the overthrow of the taliban regime in afghanistan following the september  attacks the hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation and the use of overwhelming military force powell was the subject of controversy in  when in a conversation with british foreign

party needs me more than the democratic party needs me and you can be a republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration and improving our education system and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country i don’t think theres anything inconsistent with this  views on the iraq war while powell was wary of a military solution he supported the decision to invade iraq after the bush administration concluded that diplomatic efforts had failed after his departure from the state department powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for american involvement in the iraq war at the  aspen ideas festival in colorado powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to president bush the consequences of going into an arab country and becoming the occupiers during this discussion he insisted that the us appeal to the united nations first but if diplomacy failed he would support the invasion i also had to say to him that you are the president you will have to make the ultimate judgment and if the judgment is this isnt working and we dont think it is going to solve the problem then if military action is undertaken im with you i support you in a  interview on cnn powell reiterated his support for the  decision to invade iraq in the context of his endorsement of barack obama stating my role has been very very straightforward i wanted to avoid a war the president bush agreed with me we tried to do that we couldnt get it through the un and when the president made the decision i supported that decision and ive never blinked from that ive never said i didnt support a decision to go to war powells position on the iraq war troop surge of  has been less consistent in december  he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the us military had enough troops to carry it out successfully he stated i am not persuaded that another surge of troops into baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence this civil war will work following his endorsement of barack obama in october  however powell praised general david petraeus and us troops as well as the iraqi government concluding that its starting to turn around by mid he had concluded a surge of us forces in iraq should have come sooner perhaps in late  throughout this period powell

rhetorical abilities in addition to his style and substance he additionally referred to obama as a transformational figure powell further questioned mccains judgment in appointing sarah palin as the vice presidential candidate stating that despite the fact that she is admired now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks i dont believe shes ready to be president of the united states which is the job of the vice president he said that obamas choice for vicepresident joe biden was ready to be president he also added that he was troubled by the false intimations that obama was muslim powell stated that obama is a christian—hes always been a christian but the really right answer is what if he is is there something wrong with being a muslim in this country the answers no thats not america powell then mentioned kareem rashad sultan khan a muslim american soldier in the us army who served and died in the iraq war he later stated over the last seven weeks the approach of the republican party has become narrower and narrower  i look at these kind of approaches to the campaign and they trouble me powell concluded his sunday morning talk show comments it isnt easy for me to disappoint sen mccain in the way that i have this morning and i regret that  i think we need a transformational figure i think we need a president who is a generational change and thats why im supporting barack obama not out of any lack of respect or admiration for sen john mccain later in a december   cnn interview with fareed zakaria powell reiterated his belief that during the last few

potential presidential candidate powells experience in military matters made him a very popular figure with both american political parties many democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters while many republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past republican administrations put forth as a potential democratic vice presidential nominee in the  us presidential election or even potentially replacing vice president dan quayle as the republican vice presidential nominee powell eventually declared himself a republican and began to campaign for republican candidates in  he was touted as a possible opponent of bill clinton in the  us presidential election possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in iowa and even leading new hampshire polls for the gop nomination but powell declined citing a lack of passion for politics powell defeated clinton – in a hypothetical matchup proposed to voters in the exit polls conducted on election day despite not standing in the race powell won the republican new hampshire vicepresidential primary on writein votes in  powell founded americas promise with the objective of helping children from all socioeconomic sectors that same year saw the establishment of the colin l powell center for leadership and service the mission of the center is to prepare new generations of publicly engaged leaders from populations previously underrepresented in public service and policy circles to build a strong culture of civic engagement at city college and to mobilize campus resources to meet pressing community needs and serve the public good  powell was mentioned as a potential candidate in the  us presidential election but decided against running once texas governor george w bush secured the republican nomination powell endorsed him for president and spoke at the  republican national convention bush eventually won and powell was appointed secretary of state in the electoral college vote count of  powell received three votes from faithless electors from washington secretary of state powell national security advisor condoleezza rice and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld listen to president george w bush speak as secretary of state in the bush administration powell was perceived as moderate powell was unanimously confirmed by the united states senate over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other us secretary of state in  years  on september   powell was in lima peru meeting with president alejandro toledo and us ambassador john hamilton and attending the special session of the oas general assembly that subsequently adopted the interamerican democratic charter after the september  attacks powells job became of critical importance in managing americas relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the war on terrorism powell came under fire for his role in building the case for the  invasion of iraq in a press statement on february   he had said that sanctions against iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by saddam hussein as was the case in the days leading up to the persian gulf war powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of saddam preferring to continue a policy of containment however powell eventually agreed to go along with the bush administrations determination to remove saddam he had often clashed with others in the administration who were reportedly planning an iraq invasion even before the september  attacks an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar richard clarke in front of the  commission the main concession powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the iraq war was the involvement of the international community in the invasion as opposed to a unilateral approach he was also successful in persuading bush to take the case of iraq to the united nations and in moderating other initiatives powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign computergenerated image of an alleged mobile production facility for biological weapons presented by powell at the un security council on may   us and uk experts examined the trailers and declared they had nothing to do with biological weapons powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving a presentation to the united nations security council in february  powells chief role was to garner international support for a multinational coalition to mount the invasion to this end powell addressed a plenary session of the united nations security council on february   to argue in favor of military action citing numerous anonymous iraqi defectors powell asserted that there can be no doubt that saddam hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more powell also stated that there was no doubt in my mind that saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons most observers praised powells oratorical skills however britains channel  news reported soon afterwards that a uk intelligence dossier that powell had referred to as a fine paper during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by american graduate student ibrahim almarashi a  report by the iraq survey group concluded that the evidence that powell offered to support the allegation that the iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction wmds was inaccurate in an interview with charlie rose powell contended that prior to his un presentation he had merely four days to review the data concerning wmd in iraq a senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in powells speech state department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech some of the claims were taken out but others were left in such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery the administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence particularly what was singlesourced to the informant known as curveball powell later recounted how vice president dick cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech telling him youve got high poll ratings you can afford to lose a few points powells longtime aidedecamp and chief of staff from – colonel lawrence wilkerson later characterized cheneys view of powells mission as to go up there and sell it and well have moved forward a peg or two fall on your damn sword and kill yourself and ill be happy too in september  powell was asked about the speech during an interview with barbara walters and responded that it was a blot on his record he went on to say it will always be a part of my record it was painful its painful now wilkerson said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the american people in preparing powells erroneous testimony before the united nations security council because powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion such as donald rumsfeld and paul

profound effect on powells views of the proper use of military force these views are described in detail in the autobiography my american journey the powell doctrine as the views became known was a central component of us policy in the persian gulf war the first us war in iraq and us invasion of afghanistan the overthrow of the taliban regime in afghanistan following the september  attacks the hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation and the use of overwhelming military force powell was the subject of controversy in  when in a conversation with british foreign

party needs me more than the democratic party needs me and you can be a republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration and improving our education system and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country i don’t think theres anything inconsistent with this  views on the iraq war while powell was wary of a military solution he

continued support for american involvement in the iraq war at the  aspen ideas festival in colorado powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to president bush the consequences of going into an arab country and becoming the occupiers during this discussion he insisted that the us appeal to the united nations first but if diplomacy failed he would support the invasion i also had to say to him that you are the president you will have to make the ultimate judgment and if the judgment is this isnt working and we dont think it is going to solve the problem then if military action is undertaken im with you i support you in a  interview on cnn powell reiterated his support for the  decision to invade iraq in the context of his endorsement of barack obama stating my role has been very very straightforward i wanted to avoid a war the president bush agreed with me we tried to do that we couldnt get it through the un and when the president made the decision i supported that decision and ive never blinked from that ive never said i didnt support a decision to go to war powells position on the iraq war troop surge of  has been less consistent in december  he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the us military had enough troops to carry it out successfully he stated i am not persuaded that another surge of troops into baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence this civil war will work following his endorsement of barack obama in october  however powell praised general david petraeus and us troops as well as the iraqi government concluding that its starting to turn around by mid he had concluded a surge of us forces in iraq should have come sooner perhaps in late  throughout this period powell

rhetorical abilities in addition to his style and substance he additionally referred to obama as a transformational figure powell further questioned mccains judgment in appointing sarah palin as the vice presidential candidate stating that despite the fact that she is admired now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks i dont believe shes ready to be president of the united states which is the job of the vice president he said that obamas choice for vicepresident joe biden was ready to be president he also added that he was troubled by the false intimations that obama was muslim powell stated that obama is a christian—hes always been a christian but the really right answer is what if he is is there something wrong with being a muslim in this country the answers no thats not america powell then mentioned kareem rashad sultan khan a muslim american soldier in the us army who served and died in the iraq war he later stated over the last seven weeks the approach of the republican party has become narrower and narrower  i look at these kind of approaches to the campaign and they trouble me powell concluded his sunday morning talk show comments it isnt easy for me to disappoint sen mccain in the way that i have this morning and i regret that  i think we need a transformational figure i think we need a president who is a generational change and thats why im supporting barack obama not out of any lack of respect or admiration for sen john mccain later in a december   cnn interview with fareed zakaria powell reiterated his belief that during the last few
