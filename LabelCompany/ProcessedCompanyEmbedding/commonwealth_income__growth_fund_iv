securities lawwhite securities law  securities fraud attorneys and finra arbitration lawyers menu may   comments  blog securities fraud recovery of commonwealth income  growth fund investment losses last updated on july   the white law group continues to investigate the sale of commonwealth income  growth funds iviii by brokerdealers including commonwealth capital corp that may have failed to perform adequate due diligence when recommending this investment to clients according to their website commonwealth capital corp is an equipment leasing and financial services company that was founded in  and is located in pennsylvania commonwealth specializes primarily in information technology medical technology and telecommunications equipment and “offers one of the only information technology specialized public alternative investment funds in the us” the trouble with alternative investments like the offerings in commonwealth income  growth funds is that they involve substantial risk and are generally illiquid investments according to the form s filed with the securities and exchange commission commonwealth income  growth fund ii “expects that there will be no public or private market for the units due to this lack of liquidity limited partners must be prepared to hold their units for the life of the partnership and limited partners will be able to sell their units if at all only at a substantial discount” this makes these types of investments ill suited for retired individuals or individuals with limited income that may need access to their money for unexpected medical or living expenses in addition to the high risk and illiquid nature of income  growth funds extremely high sales commissions are associated with these investments for example commonwealth income  growth fund v according to their registration from filed with the securities and exchange commissions “will pay commonwealth capital securities corp as the dealer manager an underwriting commission of up to  of the capital contributions”  unfortunately these high commissions can potentially provide incentive for unscrupulous brokerdealers to down play the risks and push the sale of commonwealth funds onto unsuitable investors to make matters worse according to investment news commonwealth capital securities corp owner and chief executive kimberley springsteenabbott has been accused by the financial industry regulator authority finra of misusing approximately  of investors money between  and  according to the finra complaint ms springsteenabbott “directed the misuse of investor funds to pay for various american express credit card charges that were not related to legitimate business purposes of the funds” the charges included  for a family vacation to florida and a  for  board of directors meetings brokerdealers have a legal obligation to act in the best interest of their clients and have to demonstrate adequate due diligence on an investment before recommending the investment to a client furthermore recommendations should be consistent with an individual’s age risk tolerance financial objectives and investment knowledge brokerdealers that have not done their fiduciary duty or adequately disclose the risks when selling investments may be held liable for damages lost through finra arbitration claims if you have suffered losses in a commonwealth income  growth
