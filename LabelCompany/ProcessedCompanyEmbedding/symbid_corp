forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including those under risk factors in this form k that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forwardlooking statements the companys actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of several factors the company does not undertake any obligation to update forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report as a result of the share exchange and the change in business and operations of the company from engaging in the business of an ecommerce daily discount marketplace to the business of becoming a global equity based crowdfunding platform a discussion of the past preshare exchange financial results of symbid corp is not pertinent and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of symbid bv the wholly owned operating subsidiary of symbid holding bv and the accounting acquirer prior to the share exchange are considered the historical financial results of the company the following discussion highlights the companys results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein the following discussion and analysis are based on the companys audited financial statements contained in this current report which we have prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles you should read this discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto basis of presentation the audited financial statements for our fiscal years ended december   and  include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below in the opinion of management all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature overview overview  a new product was introduced to the market at the start of  to balance our product portfolio and strengthen the focus on the core activity of matching online entrepreneurs and investors symbid group licenses were being offered to partners wanting their own crowdfunding group on the symbid platform fees are typically lower as compared to fees charged for the white label platforms lowering the barriers for new partners to enter the symbid ecosystem refocusing the product strategy to the core activity is the main reason for the total revenue for  being lower compared to the  period however we feel comfortable by this shift in the product strategy our product portfolio has become more balanced and focused in addition to the group product we developed new corporate partnership products with this product category we are taking first steps in offering crowdfunding services to large corporates a corporate partnership deal consists of several other products being packaged into one deal which over time will result in more efficient sales cycles and a focus on building up a portfolio of partners we can scale up our services with one of those crowdfunding related services is the valuation tool from equidam holding bv where we became a shareholder in august  in september we raised  as symbid bv in equity from one new investor sharpe financial communication and current shareholders of symbid bv the proceeds from this raise have been used as working capital and for pr services overview  during  we have seen a significant increase in the equitybased crowdfunding volume of the business in  we added approximately  new users to our thriving community as of december   we had  users within our community as of december   symbid has facilitated over  million in funding to innovative startups and smes for the financial year  the funding volume alone totaled approximately   million during  a total of  entrepreneurs were successfully funded through our equitybased crowdfunding platform the results of our crowdfunding business in  were facilitated by the launch of a new version of our crowdfunding platform the design look and feel and user interaction of the platform significantly changed by the implemented improvements  has also proved to be the year of preparing new product rollouts for the coming period we acquired fac bv in order to start offering monitoring services to the market also we have been investing in the preparation of the launch of our loan product offering we aim at launching those products and services in the first half year of  however there can be no assurance these goals will be achieved during  we launched one product to the market which relates to the groups product we launched during  in a collaboration with farmersfunding we launched our private placement board within the dutch market the product features are comparable to the group feature we offer on the crowdfunding platform closed group funding through an online platform where within the group functionality only equitybased crowdfunding could be offered within the private placement board all types of product can be offered in the latter symbid is not taking care of the execution of the actual transaction between sme and investors the corporate partnership product has been evolving over the past year into a model where corporates can become a partner in the funding network of symbid first corporate partnerships to be closed in  however there can be no assurance this goal will be achieved going concern the company has suffered recurring losses for  a net loss of  december    as of december   the company had cash on hand of  current liabilities to credit institutions of  and a working capital deficit of  the recurring losses raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the company which in turn is dependent upon the companys ability to raise capital andor generate positive cash flows from operations the financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classifications that might be necessary in the event the company cannot continue in existence additionally our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their report for the years ended december   and  regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating operating cash flow and raising capital sufficient to fund operations we have discussed our strategy and plans relating to these matters elsewhere in this annual report although the consolidated financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties we expect that with the successful closing of the ppo which we commenced in october  we will be able to fund ongoing operations and accelerate our international expansion for the next nine  months our business strategy may not be successful in addressing these issues however and if we cannot continue as a going concern our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us strategy during  we developed a template model for our corporate crowdfunding platform the pillars of this model are standardization economies of scale and the concept think global act local through standardization our core crowdfunding processes have been fully documented and can be easily rolled out in other markets other new crowdfunding related products and services can be incorporated under the same model with the netherlands being our test market and new models can be copied from there to other markets our main revenue stream is based on a transaction based model so in the end we require a certain scale to operate successfully a scale which could best be fueled by making use of network effects the continued exponential growth of our core investment crowdfunding business in  is the foundation on which the funding network is being built this new forwardthinking brand identity is rooted in our positioning at the heart of financial technology and reinforces the introduction of several new products and services starting the first quarter of  february  marks a crucial milestone in our strategic vision to provide the most efficient access to capital service worldwide as we add monitoring and dealmaking tools to our online investment platform during the start of the second quarter we aim at launching a debt based crowdfunding solution to the dutch sme market the funding network aims at giving small businesses direct access to all forms of finance while offering investors full transparency on the potential risks and returns of their portfolio symbid is becoming the goto platform for sme funding connecting new and traditional sources of finance in one integrated network built around cuttingedge technology by expanding our product portfolio market reach and revenue models by adding a monthly recurring revenue stream from monitoring services we intend to reach a breakeven point in our cash flow by the end of  for the international expansion separate funding will be required which does imply we require a significant capital increase to realize this growth path and cover the related expected investments and operational losses with the current ppo we intend to obtain the required capital for our next stage of the international rollout in europe so other countries beyond italy by being quoted as symbid corp on the otc bulletin board and the otc markets qb tier we intend to raise more capital from the markets in order to realize also the future stages of our growth path and start also operations in the united states once the jobsact has been implemented ultimately we intend to become the largest online funding network worldwide however there can be no assurance this goal will be achieved highlights the following is a summary of our financial performance for the financial year   consolidated revenue for the twelve month periods ended december   and  totaled approximately  and  respectively an increase of over   for the twelve months ended december   over  of our total revenues during this period was attributable to core equity based crowdfunding activities  for the twelve month periods ended december   and

more detail note  to the financial statements incorporation of symbid germany gmbh in august  we incorporated in germany our subsidiary symbid germany gmbh we contributed capital of  to this

having switched its business focus to that of the publishing of games gambitious bv requiring capital contributions from its existing owners and gambitious bv no longer constituting a strategic fit with our evolving operations critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate the accounting estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements a complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our audited financial statements in general managements estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ from those estimates made by management we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note  to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition in  we generated substantially all our revenue from administration and success fees from transactions on the crowdfunding platform revenue from these transactions is accounted for at the moment an investment is made or a proposition is successfully funded there is no credit risk since the fees are collected directly at the moment that the transaction takes place on the platform at the start of a funding campaign the entrepreneur signs a contract with symbid pursuant to which he or she agrees to pay symbid a success fee once a successful fund raising campaign for that entrepreneur closes once the funding campaign has closed symbids success fee is transferred by intersolve the third party banking entity that holds all funds in escrow until closing and the net proceeds of the funding are transferred by intersolve to the entrepreneur upon completion of the funding campaign on symbids platform services delivered under the contract with the entrepreneur have been and symbid recognizes its success fee revenues at the time the campaigns proceeds have been simultaneously transferred to the company also because the success fee percentage is stated in the contract with the entrepreneur prior to the start of the funding campaign symbid believes that this amount is fixed and assuming the successful conclusion of the funding campaign collectible from intersolve this revenue recognition policy complies with asc s in that it is based on written agreements with the entrepreneurs contractual services have been completed pricing is fixed and determinable based on agreements with the customer and collectability is reasonably assured as revenues are forwarded directly by intersolve effectively symbid has no refund policy the cash which is collected from investors is held in a third party bank account with intersolve which cannot be used or accessed by symbid with funds in this bank account an investor buys crowdfunding credits which are accounted for in an electronic wallet and allocated by the investor to the investors funding projects of choice allocated funds can only be refunded to an investor from his electronic wallet if a particular project is not fully funded and the funding campaign is terminated in that situation the investor project allocated funds are credited by intersolve back to his electronic wallet from where he can invest again in another project or request a refund of his money from intersolve net of an administration fee of approximately   symbid receives  of this administrative fee at each year end intersolve marks the processed and completed refunds and after this internal process intersolve sends a credit invoice to symbid recognizing the refund administration costs as revenues to be paid out to symbid at the moment symbid receives the credit invoice from intersolve stating the total number of refunds and the refund administration costs to be paid out to symbid we recognize these refunds as revenue as of december   we changed our terms and made the refunds to bank accounts for investors free of any charge however intersolve is currently charging us    for each refund by an investor other revenue is generated by licensing the platform to third parties revenue is accounted for on a monthly basis for the agreed monthly licensed fee there is limited credit risk if the monthly licensed fee is not paid we are entitled to set the platform offline as of the first quarter  we will introduce two new revenue streams an application fee for each entrepreneur registering at the funding network and an ongoing monitoring fee for each entrepreneur successfully funded within the funding network since those revenue streams will be applicable only as of the first quarter  we will not discuss the revenue recognition policies here in more detail we provide a description of the different types of revenue below create process related revenues  application fees   exclusive of vat for every entrepreneur applying for funding on the funding network with part of such fee being utilized to purchase advisory services from credion in its capacity as a preferred supplier matchmaking related revenues public funding  transaction fees  for every payment transaction to a symbid

exceeding   refund fee if an investor requests a refund from the online wallet a fee is charged to the investor in the amount of approximately    of which the company will receive approximately  as of december   the company will be charged  for each refund by an investor while for the investor a refund has become free of any charge  success fee  when reaching a funding target  exclusive of vat of the target capital is charged to the target company private funding  placement fee  when reaching a funding target  exclusive of vat as flat fee is being charged to that target company monitoring related revenues  monitoring fees  the financier will pay us a monthly fee of  exclusive of vat for one monitoring portal access entrepreneurs will be charged a fee of  exclusive vat for a monitoring start package which includes three portal accesses for one year licensing related revenues in addition to sublicensing the crowdfunding platform technology to symbid coöperatie ua symbid intends to sublicense the platform technology in the forms discussed below to others in the netherlands and to country partners as part of its internalization strategy  white label licenses  symbid offers

institutions in the netherlands may from time to time exceed insured limits currently the insured limit amounts to eur    we have not experienced any losses in such accounts accounts receivable customer accounts typically are collected within a short period of time and based on its assessment of current conditions and its experience collecting such receivables management believes it has no significant risk related to its concentration within its accounts receivable components of results of operations revenues we generate our revenues partly from crowdfunding related fees like administration fees and success fees and for the other part from software license fees research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of fees we are being charged for

below overview  to mitigate the conditions that raised substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern management sought out new and current strategic institutional investors however the company was unable to raise additional funds during the first quarter of  to avoid bankruptcy due to the cash flow position of the company management decided to implement a cost reduction program during the second quarter of  the following cost reduction actions have been successfully implemented and have provided a positive impact on the cost structure of the company  during the second half of  the company was still unable to raise additional capital from investors and was forced to enter settlement agreements with its creditors and note holders to restructure the company because of the restructuring the company curtailed certain operations and changed its business focus from the operation of online funding platforms and the provision of software solutions for smes in the alternative financing market to the licensing of available software packages that the company owns and licenses in addition to the measures implemented in the first nine months of  the company also implemented the following cost reductions in connection with the restructuring during the fourth quarter of     as the result of the restructuring the companys crowdfunding platform in the netherlands is now operated through symbid coop the company previously controlled and operated symbid coop through corporate governance but as the result of the restructuring symbid coop has become an

contributed capital of  to this subsidiary which is currently an entity without operations incorporation symbid italia spa on february   symbid italia spa symbid italia an italian corporation created to develop the business of equity crowdfunding in italy was formed by our wholly owned subsidiary symbid holding bv together with banca sella holding spa banca sella and marco bicocchi pichi through symbid italia we intended to create a new online funding platform based on our existing crowdfunding technology in which italian investors and entrepreneurs could connect fund and grow together and to digitalize financial services for italian smes in connection with the formation of symbid italia we paid  for a  ownership interest banca sella held a  ownership interest and mr pichi held a  interest from the date of formation through december   symbid italia incurred operating losses of approximately  based thereon and following an extensive review of the prospects of symbid italia developing profitable operations in the near future and beyond the board of directors and shareholders of symbid italia determined that further investment in symbid italia was not warranted this conclusion was based upon an assessment of the then current and expected medium term italian equity crowdfunding market the view that the current european regulatory framework for equity crowdfunding reflects a country by country market rather than a pan european market which greatly limits expected synergies and economies of scale and because the italian equity crowdfunding regulations restrict the ability to attract nondomestic investors at the direction of the symbid italia board of directors a special symbid italia shareholder meeting was held on april   at which it was determined to liquidate symbid italia and return the residual capital to the symbid italia shareholders on may   symbid italia was liquidated and we received proceeds of  and recognized a loss on derecognition of  the loss

insufficient additional operating expenses of the company necessary to ensure its continuing operation and existence until such time that the company can fund operations independently or until the company completes an acquisition business continuation or similar transaction with an operating entity in a transaction that results in a change of control critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate the accounting estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements a complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our audited financial statements in general managements estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ from those estimates made by management we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note  to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition in  we generated substantially all our revenue from administration and success fees from transactions on the crowdfunding platform revenue from these transactions is accounted for at the moment an investment is made or a proposition is successfully funded until the end of year  there has been no credit risk since the success fees were collected directly at the moment that the transaction takes place on the platform as of january  we had to change the policy for collecting the success fees and there will be a credit risk going forward administration fees have no credit risk since the fees are collected directly at the moment the transaction takes place on the platform at the start of a funding campaign the entrepreneur signs a contract with symbid pursuant to which he or she agrees to pay symbid a success fee once a successful fund raising campaign for that entrepreneur closes once the funding campaign has closed symbids success fee is transferred by intersolve the third party banking entity that holds all funds in escrow until closing and the net proceeds of the funding are transferred by intersolve to the notary or directly to the entrepreneur upon completion of the funding campaign on symbids platform services delivered under the contract with the entrepreneur have been completed and symbid recognizes its success fee revenues at the time the campaign has been closed successfully also because the success fee percentage is stated in the contract with the entrepreneur prior to the start of the funding campaign symbid believes that this amount is fixed and assuming the successful conclusion of the funding campaign collectible from the entrepreneur this revenue recognition policy complies with asc s in that it is based on written agreements with the entrepreneurs contractual services have been completed pricing is fixed and determinable based on agreements with the customer and collectability is reasonably assured as the customers of symbid have just received their new funding effectively symbid has the following refund policy the cash which is collected from investors is held in a third party bank account with intersolve which cannot be used or accessed by symbid with funds in this bank account an investor buys crowdfunding credits which are accounted for in an electronic wallet and allocated by the investor to the investors funding projects of choice allocated funds can only be refunded to an investor from his electronic wallet if a particular project is not fully funded and the funding campaign is terminated in that situation the investor project allocated funds are credited by intersolve back to his electronic wallet from where he can invest again in another project or request a refund of his money from intersolve investors can refund to their bank accounts free of any charge however intersolve is currently charging us   for each refund by an investor other revenue is generated by licensing the platform to third parties revenue is accounted for on a monthly basis for the agreed monthly licensed fee there is limited credit risk if the monthly licensed fee is not paid we are entitled to set the platform offline we provide a description of the different types of revenue below create process related revenues  matchmaking related revenues public funding not applicable after october     private funding  monitoring related revenues  licensing related revenues symbid may sublicense the platform technology in the forms discussed below in the netherlands and to country partners    concentrations of credit risk the company has cash balances at financial institutions located in the netherlands balances at financial institutions in the netherlands may from time to time exceed insured limits currently the insured limit amounts to eur   we have not experienced any losses in such accounts accounts receivable customer accounts typically are collected within a short period of time and based on its assessment of current conditions and its experience collecting such receivables management believes it has a minimal risk related to its concentration within its accounts receivable components of results of operations revenues we generated our revenues partly from crowdfunding related fees like administration fees and success fees and for the other part from revenues from the funding network research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of fees we are being
