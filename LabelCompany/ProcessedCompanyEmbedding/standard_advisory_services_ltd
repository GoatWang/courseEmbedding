only be made after consulting with a financial advisor and with an understanding of the risks associated with any investment in securities including but not limited to market risk currency risk interest rate risk political and credit risks the risk of economic recession and the risk that issuers of securities or general stock market conditions may worsen over time  foreign investing involves certain risks including currency fluctuations and controls restrictions on foreign investments less governmental supervision and regulation less liquidity and the potential for market volatility and political instability as with any investment investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when redeemed an investor’s shares may be worth more or less than their original cost sp global is not a tax advisor a tax advisor should be consulted to evaluate the impact of taxexempt securities on portfolios and the tax consequences of making any particular investment decision risks disclaimers investors should be aware that there are risks in investing in securities and investing in these securities involves risk of loss of an investor’s principal investment and other losses that clients should be prepared to bear additionally models that allocate to the following assets classes are subject but not limited to additional risks emerging markets and international developing equity investing involves greater risks such as economic and political systems that are less developed and likely to be less stable than those of more advanced countries and markets that are characterized by lack of liquidity and price volatility small cap and mid cap companies entail greater risk than investing in larger more established ones large cap companies investment may underperform investment that are primarily focus on stocks of lower quality smaller capitalization companies during periods when the stocks of such companies are in favor real estate investment trusts may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying property the quality of credit extended defaults by borrowers and heavy cash flow dependency high yield bonds are lowerrated fixed income securities that may involve greater risk than investments in higherrated “investment grade” securities commodities are affected by underlying commodity prices which may exhibit high volatility mortgagebacked securities have heightened sensitivity to interest rate risk are subject to prepayment risk and the resulting uncertainty of the timing of cash flow and are subject to the market’s perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer inflationprotected securities are subject to several general risks including interest rate risk credit risk and market risk interest payments on inflationprotected securities will vary as the principal andor interest is adjusted for inflation and may be more volatile than interest paid on ordinary fixedincome securities the price of fixedincome securities will fluctuate with changes in interest rates and in response to changes in the financial condition of the issuer  the value of fixedincome securities generally rises when interest rates fall and fall when interest rates rise  prices of longerterm securities generally increase or decrease more sharply than those of shorterterm securities in response to interest rate changes  an investor could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security or the counterparty to a derivatives contract repurchase agreement or a loan of portfolio securities is unable or unwilling to make timely principal andor interest payments or to otherwise honor its obligations credit ratings may reflect the varying degrees of risk municipal bonds are subject to the risk that litigation legislation or other political events local business or economic conditions or the bankruptcy of the issuer could have a significant effect on an issuer’s ability to make payments of principal andor interest although funds may generally use derivative instruments such as futures contracts and swaps for hedging and risk management funds in the alternative asset class may use them to a greater extent which may result in magnified risks these instruments are subject to certain risks such as unanticipated changes in securities prices and global currency markets and sudden changes in the liquidity of the market for the derivative instrument the use of derivatives may also create leveraging risk which may cause greater volatility index investing risk – the indexing strategy does not attempt to manage volatility use defensive strategies or reduce the effects of any longterm periods of poor stock performance market fluctuations can cause the performance of an index to be significantly influenced by a handful of companies because different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions performance may sometimes be lower than funds that actively invest in stocks that comprise the index as a result of index sampling the securities selected will not provide investment performance matching that of the index managed portfolio risk – as an actively managed portfolio the value of a fund’s investments could decline because the financial condition of an issuer may change due to such factors as management performance reduced demand or overall market changes financial markets may fluctuate or overall prices may decline or the manager’s investment techniques could fail to achieve the fund’s investment objective fixed income risks –investing in fixed income securities and related derivatives involves risks such as interest rate risk credit risk and the possibility that an issuer will default on the payment of interest and principal  an investor could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security or the counterparty to a derivatives contract repurchase agreement or a loan of portfolio securities is unable or unwilling to make timely principal andor interest payments or to otherwise honor its obligations  credit ratings may reflect the varying degrees of risk  model portfolios may be subject but not limited to these additional risks model portfolio returns are also affected by the ability of the underlying fund managers to achieve their investment objectives equity model portfolios and models that may include them tend to be more volatile have higher betas and sector concentration or exclude entire sectors in addition models that use sp global’s fair value methodology are sensitive to earnings estimates and their realizations currency risk – the value of a fund’s foreign investments will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates  the us dollar value of a foreign security decreases when the value of the us dollar rises against the foreign currency in which the security is denominated and increases when the value of the us dollar falls against such currency event risk – there may be risk due to unforeseen events associated with a company market risk – securities may also decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions or particular industries represented in the securities markets such as competitive conditions  in addition the markets may not favor a particular kind of security such as dividendpaying securities and may not favor equities or bonds at all stock market risk – stock market risk refers to the fact that stock prices typically fluctuate more than the values of other types of securities typically in response to changes in the particular company’s financial condition and factors affecting the market in general  over time the stock market tends to move in cycles with periods when stock prices rise and periods when stock prices decline  consequently a broadbased market drop may also cause a stock’s price to fall  bond market risk generally refers to credit risk and interest rate risk fixed income model portfolios’ selection of fixed income securities are subject to shifts in interest rates and credit risks and the risk that an issuer may default on payments of interest and principal  performance disclosures for model allocation portfolios performance disclosures for equity models general country disclaimer information and

financial services  products advisory federal minimum standards for appraisal management companies approved nanci l weissgold morey barnes yost view advisory as pdf just over a year after their proposal late last month six federal regulatory agencies—the office of the comptroller of the currency occ federal reserve board frb federal deposit insurance corporation fdic national credit union administration ncua consumer financial protection bureau cfpb and federal housing finance agency collectively the “agencies”—approved rules creating federal minimum requirements for state registration and supervision of appraisal management companies “minimum standards” the final rule implements section  of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which added section  to the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  firrea to include requirements for appraisal management companies amcs noteworthy is that according to the agencies section  does not compel a state to establish an amc registration and supervision program nor is a penalty imposed on a state that does not establish a regulatory structure for amcs within  months of issuance of this final rule however in a state that has not adopted the amc minimum requirements established by this rule amcs are barred by section  from providing appraisal management services for federally related transactions unless they are owned and controlled by a federally regulated depository institution the final rule will take effect  days after publication in the federal register the date of which is to be determined states will have three years from the rule’s effective date to implement the minimum standards with the possibility of a oneyear extension federally regulated amcs will have  months from the rule’s effective date to comply with applicable requirements what do the minimum standards do set a baseline unchanged from the proposed version of the rules under the minimum standards each state that chooses to participate must have an amc licensing program that meets certain criteria and must impose certain requirements on an amc subject to state registration a state’s amc licensing program must have mechanisms to  review and approve or deny an amc’s application for initial registration  review and renew or deny an amc’s registration periodically  examine the books and records of an amc operating in the state and require such amc to submit reports information and documents  verify that appraisers on the amc’s panel hold valid state certifications or licenses as applicable  conduct investigations of amcs to assess potential violations of applicable appraisalrelated laws regulations or orders  discipline amcs that violate applicable appraisalrelated laws regulations or orders and  report an amc’s violation of applicable appraisalrelated laws regulations or orders as well as disciplinary and enforcement actions and other relevant information about an amc’s operations to the appraisal subcommittee all amcs subject to state registration must satisfy the following minimum standards register with and be subject to supervision by the state appraiser regulator engage only statecertified or statelicensed appraisers for federally related transactions frts establish and comply with processes and controls designed to ensure that an amc only engages an appraiser who has the appropriate education expertise and experience necessary to competently complete a particular appraisal assignment direct the appraiser to perform the assignment in accordance with the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice uspap and establish and comply with processes and controls reasonably designed to ensure that the amc conducts its appraisal management services in accordance with the appraisal independence standards of section ea–i of the truth in lending act tila and regulations adopted thereunder states remain free to impose additional obligations on registered amcs as section  of firrea is not intended to “be construed to prevent states from establishing requirements in addition to” the minimum standards alston  bird observation those who had hoped that the minimum standards would provide some consistency in the 0state regulatory landscape may be disappointed once they meet the baseline states are free to create additional requirements for amcs—which as they exist in current laws may be vastly inconsistent for instance in the final rule the agencies declined to provide guidance on whether and how states may interpret and enforce the “customary and reasonable” fee provision of section e of tila—an issue that has troubled amcs in recent years clarify the entities to which their requirements apply when proposing the minimum standards the agencies sought comment on how to define the terms “appraisal management company” and “appraisal management services” as adopted the agencies’ rules define an amc as a person that  provides appraisal management services to creditors or secondary mortgage market participants including affiliates  provides such services in connection with valuing a consumer’s principal dwelling as security for a consumer credit transaction or incorporating such transactions into securitizations and  within a given month period oversees an appraisal panel of more than  statecertified or statelicensed appraisers in a state or  or more statecertified or statelicensed appraisers in two or more states the definition of amc turns on the term “appraisal management services” which means one or more of the following  recruiting selecting and retaining appraisers  contracting with statecertified or statelicensed appraisers to perform appraisal assignments  managing the process of having an appraisal performed including providing administrative services such as receiving appraisal orders and appraisal reports submitting completed appraisal reports to creditors and secondary market participants collecting fees from creditors and secondary market participants for services provided and paying appraisers for services performed and  reviewing and verifying the work of appraisers alston  bird observation based on the final definitions of “appraisal management company” which as in its proposed form does not include the direct performance of appraisals and of the consideration only of independent contractors when determining panel membership the minimum standards exclude appraisal firms from their scope an issue on which the agencies had requested comment this puts appraisal firms at a competitive advantage as their regulatory compliance burdens will be significantly lower than state regulated amcs and they will have the ability to perform frts in every jurisdiction hybrid entities those utilizing both employee and independent contractor appraisers to perform services will be subject to the minimum standards only “when the entity maintains a panel of appraisers that includes independent contractors meeting the threshold minimum numbers” the agencies declined to treat the definitions of “amc” and “appraisal management services” as a minimum standard as a result although states may not reduce the range of services that would classify an amc they may establish additional requirements in these definitions with regard to portals—entities that provide appraisalrelated services through electronic means—the agencies declined to state that they are not amcs rather the agencies state “the business model an entity uses to provide services should not be determinative of whether the entity is an amc rather if a portal is providing appraisal management services and meets the other elements of the definition then it should be considered an amc under the final rule” identify “federally regulated amcs” to which different of the minimum standards apply a “federally regulated amc” meaning an amc that is owned and controlled by an insured depository institution as defined in  usc §  and regulated by the occ frb or fdic is subject to all of the state requirements discussed above except the requirement to register with a state alston  bird observation despite requests from commenters the agencies did not define or otherwise provide guidance on the term “owned and controlled” as a result the standard for determining which entities will be considered “federally regulated amcs” remains unclear determine the size of an amc’s appraiser panel key to the determination of what entities qualify as an amc as well as to other provisions of the minimum standards are the definition of and rules relating to appraiser panel membership first the agencies define “appraiser panel” as “a network list or roster of licensed or certified appraisers approved by the amc to perform appraisals as independent contractors for the amc” independent contractor is defined according to how the amc treats individuals for federal income taxation purposes second the definition of amc captures an entity that “within a given month period… oversees an appraiser panel of more than  statecertified or statelicensed appraisers in a state or  or more statecertified or statelicensed appraisers in two or more states” pursuant to that requirement the final rule provides guidance on the annual size calculation of an amc’s appraiser panel specifically an appraiser is deemed to be part of an amc’s appraiser panel as of the earliest date on which the amc  “accepts the appraiser for the amc’s consideration for future appraisal assignments in covered transactions or for secondary mortgage market participants in connection with covered transactions or  engages the appraiser to perform one or more appraisals on behalf of a creditor for a covered transaction or secondary mortgage market participant in connection with covered transactions”0 third an appraiser remains part of an amc’s appraiser panel until the amc  sends written notice removing the appraiser from its panel and explaining the reason for such action or  receives written notice from the appraiser requesting removal or notice of the appraiser’s death or incapacity however an appraiser who is removed from a panel and subsequently added again within a month period “will be deemed to have been part of the amc’s appraiser panel without interruption” finally the final rule leaves it to the states to determine on what basis the month period will be counted whether by the calendar year or other means alston  bird observation the agencies declined to incorporate the view of commenters who requested that only actively engaged appraisers be counted towards panel membership in part out of concern that doing so would encourage attempts to evade registration however the resulting rule leaves open the possibility that amcs may maintain vastly smaller panels in order to reduce costs which could negatively impact rural areas and small communities where fewer appraisers may be available to complete assignments however the agencies note that section  of firrea references the number of appraisers that an amc oversees on a panel or in a network and not the number of appraisers to which it actually gives assignments furthermore the agencies did not address the tie between panel membership and the payment of amc national registry fees to the appraisal subcommittee asc distinguish “covered transactions” from “federally related transactions” the minimum standards apply to amcs providing services in connection with a “covered transaction” meaning any consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer’s principal dwelling by contrast as the agencies note title xi of firrea and its implementing regulations “have applied historically only to appraisals for frts” in adopting the minimum standards the agencies take a broader approach which they believe is “consistent with the structure and text of other parts of section  most of which address appraisals generally rather than appraisals only for frts” alston  bird observation in applying the minimum standards to consumer credit transactions secured by the consumer’s principal dwelling for both frts and nonfrts the application of the minimum standards is not limited to mortgage loan originations and thus may implicate servicing activity such as loan modifications states may further expand the requirements to other credit transactions what do the minimum standards exclude a mandate for states to implement their requirements when proposing the minimum standards the agencies set forth the idea that section  does not require the states to participate in their implementation that idea carried through intact to the final rule states have three years from the rule’s effective date to enact implementing legislation or to opt out of the minimum standards’ requirements the final rule neither imposes a penalty for states that choose not to participate nor bars states from later enacting an amc regime however in nonparticipating states the only entities that will be able to provide appraisal management services in connection with frts are federally regulated amcs and those that do not meet the panel membership threshold under the definition of an “appraisal management company” notably in applying only to frts the restriction differs in scope from the minimum standards generally which do not consider whether a covered transaction is an frt the absence of a mandate has created considerable uncertainty for other amcs—those that would be subject to state regulation—which face the possibility that a state may decline to create or may repeal an existing amc regulatory scheme thereby barring them from doing business in those states whether any of the  states that have enacted amc laws will choose to comply with the minimum standards by repealing such laws or whether any of the  holdouts will decide not to enact amc legislation will be resolved by 0 however even after the deadline for enactment of legislation states will have the opportunity to elect to establish an amc regulatory regime again permitting amcs to provide services in connection with frts alston  bird observation the minimum standards leave unanswered an interesting question if states chose to adopt an appraiser licensing scheme must they also adopt an amc registration scheme in the commentary the agencies state that the minimum standards “apply to states that have elected to establish pursuant to section  of firrea an appraiser certifying and licensing agency with authority to register and supervise amcs” section  provides in full to assure the availability of state certified and licensed appraisers for the performance in a state of appraisals in federally related transactions and to assure effective supervision of the activities of certified and licensed appraisers a state may establish a state appraiser certifying and licensing agency the duties of such agency may additionally include the registration and supervision of the appraisal management companies and the addition of information about the appraisal management company to the national registry the permissive language of that section suggests that a state with an established mandatory appraiser licensing program could choose not to register amcs whether any states will choose that approach remains to be seen we note that in its economic impact analysis of the final rule the cfpb “continues to rely on the assumption that the remaining states will choose to participate either within three years or soon thereafter” and does not discuss the possibility of states opting out furthermore even if states choose not to participate the loans affected—portfolio loans over 0 that are not insured by the federal housing administration department of veterans affairs or department of agriculture rural housing service—“represent a small percentage of the market and therefore inability by certain market participants certain types of amcs to provide appraisal management services in these types of transactions in a nonparticipating state will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities” the note does not address the potential impact on larger entities clarification on the ability of states to enforce the appraisal independence standards of section e of tila comments on the agencies’ proposed rules included attention to the issue of whether states may interpret and enforce section e of tila including the requirement for an amc as an agent of a creditor to pay customary and reasonable rates of compensation to fee appraisers when services are being provided in connection with covered transactions in the commentary to the minimum standards the agencies decline to address the issue stating that other than the mandate that states require amcs to ensure that appraisals are conducted in accordance with section e “questions about what mechanisms a state agency may use to assess a party’s compliance in connection with any authority the state has to commence a civil action to enforce section e of tila are outside the scope of this rulemaking” note that the doddfrank act expanded the enforcement authority of state attorneys general under section 0e of tila to include section e but did not discuss whether state appraisal regulators may interpret that section through rulemaking or whether they may only enforce such interpretations by referring matters to their attorneys general alston  bird observation given that the minimum standards incorporate a requirement for amcs to comply with section e of tila it is interesting that the agencies declined to opine on “what mechanisms a state agency may use to assess a party’s compliance in connection with any authority the state has to commence a civil action to enforce section e of tila” unless and until the agencies decide to address the issue state appraisal boards appear to retain the ability to create and enforce their own interpretation of the customary and reasonable fee requirement—which has created considerable headaches for stateregistered amcs a discussion of state standards for appraisal review by amcs in their proposal the agencies requested comment on whether and how to address issues regarding appraisal review they emphasized that separate rulemaking on the issue would be required pursuant to section 0 of firrea that section requires the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to prescribe standards for the performance of real estate appraisals in connection with federally related transactions including “that such appraisals shall be subject to appropriate review for compliance with the uspap” although the agencies acknowledge that section  of firrea defines the “appraisal management services” that an amc provides to include appraisal review they declined to expand on the issue in adopting the minimum standards alston  bird observation as amcs and federally regulated financial institutions are aware there is a distinction between the appraisal review requirements to which a stateregistered amc is subject ie reviewing a certain percentage of all appraisals that are completed on its behalf regardless of whether such appraisals were performed in connection with frts and those to which a financial institution or its amc agent is subject pursuant to section 0 those who had hoped the minimum standards would provide some baseline for states to follow in consideration of the former are left disappointed implementation of the amc national registry fee requirement although the number of appraisers on an amc’s network or panel of appraisers will determine the size of the fee that each amc must pay to the asc’s amc national registry the agencies note in the commentary to the final rule that the logistics of such fees are outside the scope of their rulemaking instead implementation of the fee requirement will be left to the asc the minimum standards do provide however for states to report certain information on registered amcs to the asc and for federally regulated amcs to provide information to the states in which they operated to be included in such submissions alston  bird observation whether the manner in which the amc national registry fee is implemented will impact the size of appraiser panels that amcs maintain remains to be seen once the asc engages in a separate rulemaking for now what is clear is that both stateregistered amcs and federally regulated amcs will be subject to the requirement to pay such fees conclusion while the minimum standards compared to the proposed version of the rules present very few surprises they also leave a few important questions unanswered we are hopeful that the agencies will be able to provide guidance on some of these such as which entities will qualify as “federally regulated amcs” furthermore we are interested in how and when the agencies will engage in rulemaking to implement the appraisal review requirements of section 0 of firrea and how the requirements of those rules will affect amcs that may be subject to additional requirements under state laws as states move forward with the process of implementing the minimum standards alston  bird is available to assist clients with reviews of their compliance practices to ensure that they satisfy all laws applicable to amcs
