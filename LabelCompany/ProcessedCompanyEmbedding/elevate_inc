when anyone with a camera which is everyone considers themselves a photographer it can be hard to set yourself apart as a professional additionally if you’re an independent event photographer you have a lot of work to do besides the photography itself one of the hardest things is learning how to market yourself so that you have a steady stream of good customers here are some ideas to keep your business booming    social media promotions now it should be a given that any photographer looking to grow their business uses social media to showcase their work this is especially true for social media networks that are visuallymotivated like instagram and pinterest however using social media effectively to grow is about more than having a profile and posting now and then here are some ideas make sure you have a google business page since this is really important for organic search results the best way to build this page is by getting reviews from your clients offer a giveaway or a major discount to your followers but be smart about it getting new clients who are only interested in the discount and would never hire you for full price isn’t actually worth your time the best way to use this approach is to offer twoforone deals to existing clients or referral bonuses to motivate your current clients to talk to their friends    branded usb drives it’s common practice today to give a flash drive with all of the photos that you take at an event because we’re able to take a lot of photos with our digital resources instead of just using a generic usb drive next time think about using one that has your branding on it this reminds them of the experience of hiring you as a photographer whenever they’re happily reminiscing with the fantastic photos that you captured this kind of effect can increase return customers and referrals    invite helpers whenever you’re doing a job at an event invite others to help with small jobs like holding the reflector and give them small items of branded swag as a thank you this helps people to watch the process up close and get an idea of your expertise it also gives them familiarity and a relationship that they’ll remember next time they need a photographer this technique can be especially handy for weddings when your best future clients are other wedding guests and people from the wedding party    feature your work on local publications most people think that magazine features happen when the reporter reaches out to a lucky photographer but the truth is that often the work that gets featured on publications is submitted by enterprising professionals your work can be featured on local publications if you do some outreach aim for niche interests and local businesses so that you’re more likely to stand out and remember that a lot of these publications will be online which is just as good and even better sometimes as a magazine often features won’t just be about your work but about the event that you were hired for so sometimes all you have to do is make sure that your best work is featured and that you have credit in the article if the article is online make sure there’s a link to your website    make professional connections for professional photographers business to business connections are essential just one valuable connection can open up so many possibilities for you and often the same vendors will travel in the circles that you want to so just knowing a few wedding planners dj’s and caterers can boost your referrals exponentially every year that’s why you should always make the most of opportunities to network with other wedding professionals share your card or other branded gear to help them remember your name and webpage so they can refer people quickly and effectively go to conventions and make sure that you return the favor of referrals so that they understand the value of your relationship       x request a quote clients  elevate inc  elevate inc       join our email

the current skepticism an opportunity billy duberstein dubs apr   at pm elevate credit inc nyseelvt  made its public market debut on april  the only fintech lender to go public since the  debuts of lending club nyselc and on deck capital nyseondk why has it taken so long probably because the lending club and on deck stock charts look like this  lc data by ycharts elevate was supposed to go public in january   not exactly a good time in the markets  so the offering was scrapped until this year while the markets are certainly in better shape elevate priced well below its initial expectation at  per share as opposed to the anticipated  per share why all the hate well take two risky businesses  fintech and subprime loans— stick them together and presto investors get nervous but is the current skepticism an opportunity what elevate credit is elevate was spun off from think finance a lending software company in  elevate offers unsecured loans to borrowers with lessthanprime credit in the us and uk in three products rise sunny and elastic the companys target borrowers are individuals with credit scores less than  if that sounds like risky business thats because it is thats why elevates loans carry interest rates ranging from  to  while this sounds extreme the companys competitors are payday loan operations pawn shops and other businesses that charge an average of  according to the consumer protection bureau in fact management stated that the company has saved this demographic more than  billion since  elevate also decreases customers interest rates if they consistently make timely payments over a certain period of time  giving customers the opportunity to lift their credit scores many payday lenders dont even report to credit bureaus at all which means reliable consumers wind up exactly where they started since their reliable payments are never added to their credit scores assuming no moral objections does elevate make a good investment source getty images positive characteristics elevate is a highgrowth business operating in an area unappetizing to many others which means it maybe somewhat insulated from competition the companys iq and dora platforms use of hadoop databases which analyze a massive  terabytes and utilize  thousand different variables when assessing risk remarkably machines decide the fate of  of loan applications not humans these tools have kept loan losses as a percentage of revenues stable at  over the past four years and principal chargeoffs between   this seems high but when you consider the average apr is  you can see how that is a scalable business the company grew revenues at a  clip in  but like most other recent tech ipos wasnt profitable posting losses of  million still compared with its fintech peers it looks good on several metrics stock  pricesales ratio revenue growth  elevate   lending club   ondeck   source lendingclub ondeck elevate financials table by author these businesses have different models and target consumers but as you can see elevate is the least expensive of the bunch as well as the fastestgrowing there are other attractive aspects to the subprime market one it is very big comprising  million people in the us and uk two the market can actually be countercyclical which means chargeoffs stay the same or improve in a recession this is because traditional lenders tighten credit in a downturn which throws many creditworthy borrowers into the subprime pool this finding was based on managements own experience during the last financial crisis according to the companys s  but there are risks while elevate may look enticing based on these factors there are a number of risks two big ones stuck out to me  regulation subprime lenders could easily become the target of regulation either in the us uk individual states or all of the above while the trump administration and republican congress makes this less likely there are still federal regulators such as the consumer protection bureau on the case for instance regulators could restrict the companys use of the automated clearing house systems or electronic payment transfers from peoples bank accounts it is pretty easy to see how that could impede elevates ability to collect payments if this were to happen   debt financing one of the key differentiators among online lenders is how they fund themselves elevate primarily funds its loans through highyield debt from just a single source victory park capital a privately held alternative asset manager victory upped its loan facility to  million last summer  and funds elevates sunny and rise products at a variable rate based on libor plus a spread of anywhere between  and  moreover elevate earns fees to license its technology to republic bank which originates the elastic lines of credit republic then sells up to  of the loans to an entity owned by  you guessed it   victory park elevate also has to guarantee this entity against losses conclusion i was ready to get on board with elevate until i got to the debt financing risk the combination of dependency on a single lender high costs of capital and having to guarantee loan losses to a third party doesnt sit well with me if elevate can diversify its funding sources i might be more interested but for now im sitting on the sidelines until that happens billy duberstein owns shares of
