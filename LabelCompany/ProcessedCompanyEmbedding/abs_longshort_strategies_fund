diligence quantitative analysis and operational due diligence each independent due diligence team has the power to veto further work on a potential manager and a manager is only eligible for investment after being approved by each team three stage process  qualitative due diligence the objective of the qualitative due diligence team is to source what we believe to be the most talented managers within the equity longshort space our process seeks to identify the managers motivation and competitive edge and to determine whether there is an alignment of interest we assign significant value to our determination of each key individuals character which we seek to confirm through numerous reference checks relying on our extensive network additionally we must have a thorough understanding of the managers strategy and feel comfortable with the strategys return drivers we will not invest in a strategy that we dont understand fully  quantitative due diligence the objective of the quantitative due diligence teams analysis is to confirm the research completed by the qualitative team particularly as it relates to the potential managers strategy and return drivers the quantitative team will use data including exposures attribution and monthly or daily returns to determine where the manager takes risk and how the manager has historically been compensated for those risks factors beta flexible beta and alpha if the qualitative and quantitative teams are unable to reconcile their perceptions of the managers strategy then the investment will not be pursued  operational due diligence the objective of the operational due diligence team is to confirm that a managers back office operations strive for industry best practices prior to and during our investment in the event that aspects of the operational set up are lacking our team will veto the investment or work with the managers back office staff to implement all necessary improvements in short operational risk should be minimized leaving only those investment risks that we are comfortable with and expect to be compensated for identifying investment talent with an experienced team and

accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america �us gaap� the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement as well as reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates � the fund is an investment company and accordingly follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification topic  �financial services�investment companies� � a fair value of financial instruments the board of trustees �board� has established a valuation committee to oversee the valuation of the fund�s investments on behalf of the fund the board has approved valuation procedures for the fund the �valuation procedures� the valuation procedures provide that the fund will value its investments in direct investments and portfolio funds at fair value � the valuations of investments in portfolio funds are generally supported by monthly valuation statements received from the portfolio funds� independent administrators in addition investor reports and audited financial statements among other things maybe considered when available or necessary � in accordance with the valuation procedures fair value as of each monthend or other applicable accounting periods as applicable ordinarily will be the value determined as of such date by each portfolio fund in accordance with the portfolio fund�s valuation policies and reported at the time of the fund�s valuation as a general matter the fair value of the fund�s interest in a portfolio fund will represent the amount that the fund could reasonably expect to receive from the portfolio fund if the fund�s interest was redeemed at the time of valuation based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the fund believes to be reliable in the event that a portfolio fund or its independent administrator does not report a monthend value to the fund on a timely basis the fund will determine the fair value of such portfolio fund based on the most recent estimated value reported by the portfolio fund as well as any other relevant information available at the time the fund values its portfolio � the fund classifies its assets and liabilities into three levels based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement estimated values may differ from the values that would have been used if a ready market existed or if the investments were liquidated at the valuation date �  � abs longshort strategies fund notes to the financial statements  continued april   � the threetier hierarchy distinguishes between  inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and  inputs that reflect the reporting entity�s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes various inputs are used in determining the value of the fund�s investments the inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below � � level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date the types of investments in level  generally include listed equities and listed derivatives � � level  inputs other than quoted prices within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly and fair value that is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies investments in this category generally include corporate bonds and loans less liquid and restricted equity securities and certain overthecounter derivatives a significant adjustment to a level  input could result in the level  measurement becoming a level  measurement � � level  inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability the inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information in the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation investments in this category generally include equity and debt positions in private companies � investments in portfolio funds are recorded at fair value using the portfolio fund�s net asset value as a practical expedient � the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update �asu� no  disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent asu no  amends the fair value accounting rules to remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient the fund has adopted this update and as a result of adopting it investments in portfolio funds with a fair value of  are excluded from the fair value hierarchy as of april   � b investment income interest income is recorded on an accrual basis � c fund expenses the fund will pay all of its expenses or reimburse the adviser or their

subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended that are applicable to regulated investment companies �rics� and to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and any net realized gains to its shareholders �shareholders� therefore no provision is made for federal income or excise taxes due to the �  � abs longshort strategies fund notes to the financial statements  continued april   � timing of dividend distributions and the differences in accounting for income and realized gains and losses for financial statement and federal income tax purposes the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed may differ from the year in which the income and realized gains and losses are recorded by the fund � accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the �income tax statement� requires an evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing fund�s tax returns to determine whether these positions meet a �morelikelythannot� standard that based on the technical merits have a more than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained by a taxing authority upon examination a tax position that meets the �morelikelythannot� recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the fund recognizes interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the statement of operations � the income tax statement requires management of the fund to analyze tax positions expected to be taken in the fund�s tax returns as defined by internal revenue service the �irs� statute of limitations for all major jurisdictions including federal tax authorities and certain state tax authorities during the period january   commencement of operations through april   the fund did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits the fund has no examination in progress and is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months � the character of distributions made during the year from net investment income or net realized gain may differ from the characterization for federal income tax purposes due to differences in the recognition of income expense and gainloss items for financial statement and tax purposes where appropriate reclassifications between net asset accounts are made for such differences that are permanent in nature � as of april   the federal tax cost of investment securities and unrealized appreciation depreciation were as follows � gross unrealized appreciation �   � gross unrealized depreciation � �   net unrealized appreciationdepreciation �   � cost of investments �   � � there are no

held on september   the �meeting� the board including all of the independent trustees met in person joined by among others representatives of the adviser and counsel to the fund �fund counsel� to give consideration to information provided by the adviser in seeking approval from the board of the �management agreement� a description of certain of the factors the board considered and its conclusions in approving the advisory agreement follows � the board discussed the proposed management agreement the board considered among other things  the nature extent and quality of the investment management services expected to be rendered  the experience and qualifications of the personnel that will be providing such services  the proposed fee structure and the expense ratios in relation to those of other investment companies having comparable investment policies and limitations  the direct and indirect costs that may be incurred by the adviser in performing advisory services for the fund the basis of determining and allocating these costs and the estimated profitability to the adviser in performing such services  possible economies of scale arising from any anticipated growth of the fund and the extent to which these would be passed on to shareholders of the fund  other compensation or possible benefits to the adviser and any affiliates arising from their advisory and other relationships with the fund  the fees charged by the adviser and other investment managers to similar clients and in comparison to industry fees for similar services  the historic performance of the product that was the predecessor to the fund  possible conflicts of interest that the adviser may have with respect to the fund and  the entrepreneurial risk borne by the adviser eg because a fund is in a startup mode or for other reasons the adviser�s revenues may be less or their expenses greater than anticipated the board reviewed information provided by abs in the board materials which included among other things information regarding  the adviser�s organizational structure management personnel and proposed services to the fund  the fees to be paid by the fund to the adviser for services rendered under the investment advisory agreement  the financial stability of the adviser and  the adviser�s compliance program including the adviser�s code of ethics � the board considered the services to be rendered by the adviser to the fund as set forth in the management agreement including without limitation the provision of a complete investment management program for the fund and related board reporting the voting of proxies relating to portfolio investments and the fair valuation of the fund�s portfolio investments which will consist principally of interests in private investment companies subject to oversight of the trust�s valuation committee the board also considered the due diligence process utilized by the adviser to identify and evaluate managers of the potential private investment companies in which the fund will invest and the adviser�s compliance policies and procedures including those dedicated to assuring that investments made are consistent with the fund�s investment objectives and limitations the board concluded that the nature extent and quality of the �  � abs longshort strategies fund other information unaudited  continued april   � services provided by the adviser to the fund are appropriate and consistent with the terms of the fund�s management agreement that the quality of those services are anticipated to be consistent with industry norms and that the fund is likely to benefit from the adviser�s management of the fund�s investment program � the board considered that while the fund had not commenced operations and thus did not have investment performance information to review they could consider the historic performance of the product that was the predecessor to the fund and the performance of the adviser�s other clients and concluded that the performance was in line with its primary benchmark and thus they concluded that they were satisfied with the adviser�s performance � the board also concluded that the adviser had sufficient personnel with the appropriate education and experience to serve the fund effectively and have demonstrated their continuing ability to attract and retain qualified personnel � the board considered the anticipated costs of the services provided by the adviser and the compensation and benefits received by the adviser in providing services to the fund the board compared the expected fees and expenses of the fund including the management fee to certain other closedend tender offer fund of funds the board noted that with respect to the proposed management fee to be paid to the adviser only one peer fund had a lower management fee and the projected net expense ratio of the fund excluding acquired fund fees is lower than all of the other funds in the peer group the board concluded that the adviser�s anticipated fees and profits to be derived from its relationship with the fund in light of the fund�s expenses were reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services provided taking into account the fees charged by other investment advisers for managing comparable funds the board also concluded that the overall expense ratio of the fund was reasonable taking into account the projected size of the fund and the quality of services to be provided by the adviser � the board considered the extent to which economies of scale could be realized and whether fee levels would reflect those economies noting that because the fund was small and had yet to commence operations there were currently no economies of scale � based on consideration of all factors deemed relevant the board determined that approval of the management agreement was in the best interests of the fund the board considered all factors and no one factor alone was deemed dispositive �

represent the number and market value of pooled investment vehicles and other accounts that pay the adviser a performancebased fee conflicts of interest � as a general matter certain actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise in connection with a portfolio manager�s management of the fund�s investments on the one hand and the investments of other accounts for which the team member is responsible on the other for example the management of multiple accounts may result in a team member devoting unequal time and attention to the management of each account although the adviser does not track the time a team member spends on a single portfolio it does periodically assess whether a team member has adequate time and resources to effectively manage all of the accounts for which he is responsible moreover variances in advisory fees charged from account to account may create an incentive for a team member to devote more attention to those accounts that pay higher advisory fees it is also possible that the various accounts managed could have different investment strategies that at times might conflict with one another alternatively to the extent that the same investment opportunities might be desirable for more than one account possible conflicts could arise in determining how to allocate them � the adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures including trade allocation policies and procedures which it believes address the conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients a compensation structure of portfolio manager � the portfolio managers are managing members and equity owners of the adviser their compensation consists of a fixed salary bonus compensation and their respective share of the adviser�s earnings each year a bonus pool is established based on the net income of the adviser and calculated pursuant to preset formula the bonus pool is then allocated to adviser personnel by the managing members participation in the bonus pool is at the discretion of the managing members and is based on subjective factors determined by the managing members in their sole discretion � a disclosure of securities
