“sec” for a discussion of the foregoing and other risks that relate to our business and investing in shares of our common stock general overview lapolla is a leading united states based manufacturer and global distributor of foam coatings and equipment focused on developing and commercializing foams and coatings targeted at commercial and industrial and residential applications in the insulation and construction industries we believe that being vertically integrated in both foam and coating systems puts lapolla in a strong competitive position as both product lines reduce energy consumption and ultimately lead to direct savings for consumers  lapolla’s products address growing consumer awareness of the building envelope the building envelope is the separation between the interior and the exterior environments of a building and serves as the outer shell to protect the indoor environment as well as to facilitate its climate building envelopes with increased insulation levels are becoming standard practice consumers are increasingly involved in the selection of green building products due to rising energy costs and the recent availability of tax credits and energy rebates operating segments we operate our business on the basis of two reportable segments — foam and coatings  the foam segment involves producing and in limited instances applying through subcontractors building envelope insulation foam for interior application and roofing systems the coatings segment involves producing protective elastomeric coatings and primers both segments include supplying equipment and related ancillary items used in application of our products             foam segment             our foam business involves supplying spray polyurethane foam for insulation and roofing to the construction industry lapolla provides open and closed cell spray polyurethane foams for insulation as well as closed cell technology for roofing applications                         principal products and services and markets                         spray foam insulation applications consist of perimeter wall crawl space and attic space for commercial industrial and residential applications roofing applications consist of new and retrofit commercial industrial and residential applications opencell spray foam technology is a costeffective solution to improve the energy efficiency of a building the material expands  times its initial volume and fills cavities of any shape providing a continuous protective air barrier that helps to minimize air leakage and air intrusion opencell foam insulation is a performance upgrade over conventional insulation that leads to energy efficiency improved occupant comfort a cleaner indoor environment and greater noise reduction for buildinghome owners closedcell spray foam insulation is one of the most efficient insulating materials commercially available with aged rvalues above  per inch the description “closedcell” comes from the cell structure of the finished insulation material one cubic inch of polyurethane foam insulation contains millions of tiny plastic closed cells filled with a nonozone depleting blowing agent the blowing agent is captured within the cells which contributes to highly efficient insulating properties in addition closedcell foam provides an inherent air barrier with low moisture vapor permeability and excellent resistance to water the density for closedcell spray foam is approximately two pounds per cubic foot the medium density foam provides sheer and racking strength to wall assemblies in building applications the solid nature and sealing capability of closedcell spray foam inhibits moisturedriven elements the foam segment includes revenue from the airtight division the airtight division primarily focuses on marketing promoting and selling energy saving products and energy reduction services through subcontractors the airtight multifamily energy savings program is a turnkey project service this service provides energy assessments and analysis with the assistance of independent consultants project design regulatory assistance to facilitate potential rebates from state and utility authorities and project management services this energy conservation program is designed to save landlords substantial energy costs while dramatically reducing the properties’ carbon footprint and increasing the tenants’ comfort this will increase the overall value and return on investment of the property             coatings segment             our coatings business involves supplying protective coatings for roofing systems for new and retrofit commercial and industrial applications to the roofing industry lapolla provides an economical and effective roof coating system for application over new and existing roof substrates                         principal products and services and markets spray polyurethane foam roofing consists of two components a closedcell polyurethane foam insulation and a protective coating the polyurethane foam adheres to the building substrate and items that penetrate the roof surface making it selfflashing and giving it resistance to high winds spray polyurethane foams also offer enhanced impact resistance roofs featuring spray polyurethane foam can last  to  years with minimal maintenance requirements spray polyurethane roofing can be applied over an existing roof without requiring the removal of the old roof while sprayed foam can be applied to a new roof the majority of applications involve reroofing spray polyurethane foam roofing is particularly suited for roofs with unusual configurations or with multiple penetrations as the sprayed material is selfflashing coatings often wear or need replacement before the foam resulting in less tear offs and reducing waste spray polyurethane foam roofs are also selected by architects and designers because they can be coated with compounds that enhance reflectivity thus spray polyurethane foam roofs can be considered cool roofs additionally spray polyurethane foam is an excellent insulator and increases the energy efficiency of a building

energy efficiency mostly depends on creating a better air “seal” wall insulation is a significant issue in home energy savings but there are other factors that will lower home energy efficiency as much as  of energy loss is due to air infiltration therefore the most effective way to improve energy efficiency and comfort in your home is to seal it with foam  moisture control – doors and windows water and moisture in the building envelope is the single greatest threat to building durability in residential construction in addition to causing buildingdurability issues moisture can create ideal conditions for mold growth which can dramatically impact occupant health  air leakage – ceilings outer walls floors and crawlspaces unsealed responsible for about a third of the air leakage in a home view how to improve your home energy efficiency let’s compare the most popular home insulation products insulation standardsspray foam insulationfiberglass insulationcellulose insulationhow does it work spray polyurethane foam acts as a barrier between the home and outside creating a seal that can conform to any architectural design traps air inside tiny glass fibers that contain small bubbles

efficiency most efficientless efficient less efficient for your keeping your home insulated even though it’s made from recycled newspaper health hazards polyurethane spray foam insulation consists of diisocyanate which isn’t scientifically detectable after  hour of when the foam ins applied installing spray foam requires a professional certification and proper equipment to install it fiberglass can be installed by anyone due to its long process for insulating around electrical outlets and windows often insulation isn’t completed properly leaky ducts can pull loose fiberglass insulation and spread its particles throughout your home its small particles can be inhaled and cause serious respiratory conditions the resin that bonds fiberglass can also emit small amounts of toxic fumes not sealing your home means dirt and moisture can cause mold mildew and bacteria to grow blown cellulose insulation is prone to create dust that is then blown through cracks in the walls and creates a health hazard what kind of home insulation solutions do you providewe offer two types of home insulation solutions retrofit insulation reinsulating part or all of your home through our energy assessment we present to you the parts of your home that require the most insulation to decrease your energy loss usually this involves adding spray foam insulation to your attic crawl spaces andor walls you can also retrofit part of your home that has never had insulation we’ll assess these areas and provide a spray foam insulation estimate to maintain a low energy use occasionally homeowners need a wall ceiling or flooring insulated to prevent drafts new home insulation have a new home being built or have construction already in progress request for a spray foam estimate once the foundation and frame have been completed our insulators can provide an estimate at this level of construction home energy assessmentcontact us today our insulators can provide a swift response at all phases of construction whether you’re at the conceptual phase or if construction is already underway a home energy assessment helps owners determine where their house is losing energy and money – and how such problems can be corrected to make the home more energy efficient the estimate will include checking for air leaks examining insulation inspecting the furnace and duct work performing a blower door test and using an infrared camera schedule your free home energy assessment now energy efficient spray foam insulator agriculturalairtight sprayfoam can be used in all sorts of agricultural applications when unwanted air movement and thermal resistance are concerns airtight sprayfoam is the material of choice here are a few examples of common agricultural applications how spray foam insulation is helping us farmers produce better poultry spray foam insulation is certainly no stranger to the agricultural industry for many years spray foam has helped farmers create better climate controlled storage facilities barns coolers and tanks among other things recently there has been a trend in the poultry industry to abandon the old methodology of “open air” side wall designed houses and move toward totally enclosed houses this is big news for us in the spray foam industry because there isn’t a more cost effective time saving or money saving option available for farmers when it comes to retrofitting their existing poultry houses poultry industry opportunity it is estimated that there are approximately  poultry houses in the united states today as reported by auburn university’s poultry science department the majority of these houses were originally constructed without solid side walls this design concept was intended to give farmers the ability to control air flow and sunlight with the use of a plastic curtain material that could be raised and lowered accordingly the biggest problem with this type of design is that it is terribly inefficient there is very little insulation value and virtually no way to prevent unwanted air moisture and temperature extremes from affecting the performance of the house some serious problems that occur with curtain sided houses are  greater fuel costs in winter excess litter caking due to condensation increased heat gain in summer residential applicationsan environmentally friendly home is a great benefit for builders occupants and the environment take an active role in helping reduce greenhouse gases thus slowing the effects of global warming by properly sealing a home the amount of oil that is needed to produce electricity and the carbon admitted into the environment is greatly reduced spray polyurethane foam insulation because of its efficacy as an air sealer and waterproofing agent has the potential to be
