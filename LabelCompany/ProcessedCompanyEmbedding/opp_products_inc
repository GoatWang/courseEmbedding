september   at  am dave hi matt and sarah – i have a question about this do you actually ship a real hard copy of the book and dvd program i am curious because you only have requirements for my first name and email thank you reply september   at  pm matt admin hi dave yes we do ship out the hard copies of the books and dvds we also send digital copies as well right away we use email to confirm that we only ship one per household and that is why we ask for first name and email the next page verifies shipping details reply september   at  pm lita mckay i am a christian but i am skeptical – you guys sound genuine but nothing is free please expound on what it is you’re selling and the angle once you reply i will have a look reply september   at  pm matt admin hi lita thank you for your comments i have also emailed you a little bit more about us but i’ll try to provide some clarity here for you and the others here is a quote from above – yes we do have a special mentoring program available it costs some money but to go through it you must have your family’s permission and pass a detailed application we do provide free training as well to many people since  people have asked us for training we have two types of training available –free training  our paid mentoring program over the years we have sent out many books and dvds  free of charge and helped many people get started with this idea they received the resources for free and never paid us a penny we are able to send these out for free and still make a profit on the training program because some of the people who receive our resources ask us to mentor them there is nothing for sale on our website without an application because we are limited in the number of people we can provide mentoring to that is the reason for the online application and why there is no pricing on our website hopefully that helps reply september   at  pm lita mckay matt thank you for your reply and personal email i am sorry for my rude comment before i took the dive and requested the resources it makes more sense now that you have shared there are just so many of these crazy scams out there now i like what i see and i have registered for the free classes at the end of october i pray god’s blessing on you and your family and those two cute kids of yours reply september   at  am kyle and andrea is it me or are there others who are not getting a confirmation email it says that the confirmation email was sent to verify i am a real human but i do not see the email just curious reply september   at  pm matt admin hi kyle and andrea you guys are using gmail – and unfortunately you’re getting the email and just don’t realize it check promotions and then drag it from promotions to your inbox and you’ll be all set the confirmation goes out immediately guys and you’ll get an email to verify your shipping so please add us to your address book or drag us to your inbox from gmail sorry for any delay reply september   at  am matt admin we keep receiving many of the same questionscomments over the last few days so i’ll go ahead and address them as well as a few others about faith – we’ve got some hateful and genuine questions about our faith and if we are really christians a couple comments as well about how we’re “fleecing the flock” guys – the book and dvd are free of charge and we pay for shipping secondly we provide a ton of free training online i could go on but if giving away something that helps people makes us “sinners” then we’re guilty as charged yes we are targeting believers for this business because of our vision to help the local church and nonprofit organizations various questions – yes we’ll ship everything to you within  days but you must request the dvd and book through the form above the business model serves businesses and nonprofit organizations we encourage your consultants to charge businesses but serve nonprofits for free yes we have references testimonials and more importantly a spotless reputation online with our students and clients yes we do make money if someone buys something yes we do tithe to our local church yes we have provided mentoring for free to many people yes we have served in ministry in the past and still do no you should not buy something from me because i am a christian no god probably didn’t send you here by divine appointment you are probably here because you spend too much time on social media – lol yes we do have some free training available no we don’t reply to or publish rude comments yes everything is explained in our free book and dvd yes there are limited quantities we ship out each year lastly and best of all… i am sorry but there is nothing i can do to prove my salvation on a website that one made me laugh out loud i almost replied to the comment with christian lingo but i opted to just delete it thank you emails – many thanks to our friends who have reviewed our information and sent us thank you emails and words of encouragement we greatly appreciate you all and are humbled by god’s grace on our lives our prayer is that you will be encouraged by our story again thank you all reply september   at  pm matthew johnson dear matt  sarah i have a question i confirmed my email and was able to access the private area online thank you for sharing the free resources my wife and i spent a few moments reviewing the material online but we do not see any pricing information i feel like i would be a good fit for this but i don’t see the cost associated with the business can you please expound on this as we don’t want to waste your time i did sign up for the free class in october as well reply september   at  pm matt admin hi matthew i received your comment and email message yesterday as well your email message referenced the scholarship program as well as the costs so i’ll answer both of those questions for you yes there is a scholarship program available which makes the lower mentoring program very affordable so there is free mentoring the scholarship and licensing the reason there is no pricing anywhere on the site is that we don’t offer special mentoring without a passing application programs are based upon the applicant once you submit your application you can view the options available for your situation we feel like this is the best and most honorable approach reply september   at  pm sarah admin important notice– we are receiving a lot of comments right now and many of you are posting your email address and shipping addresses in the comment section if you want the resources mailed to you please go through the correct channels and request your book and dvd here please request through this system as that is how we confirm your shipping address and mail out the packages thank you in advance for your cooperation we truly appreciate all of you reply september   at  am antoine i filled in the info for the dvd and book but didn’t see the bonus audio program i had to go back to share the website of fb to get an instant download i wanted you to know that you didn’t send me the program when i requested the book just so you know thx for doing this for the peeps of god reply september   at  pm matt admin thanks antoine we’ve added the mp program to go out by email a few minutes after you request our resources i checked and saw you got the email but i published your comment and answered the question for the sake of everyone else so for clarity we added the bonus mp program to an email that comes shortly after you optin social shares is instant download either way we appreciate you all thanks for all the amazing emails we’re receiving reply september   at  pm laurna adevino dear matt and sarah i wanted to write in and say thank you so much for putting this business model and training together i am very excited and interested and will be scheduling a call with you as soon i have a couple of questions for you guys a can i run this solo as my husband isn’t an entrepreneur b can i run this part time or does it have to be full time c how much can i make my first year – realistically both part time vs full time d how do you charge nonprofits for your services do you give a discount respectfully laurna palm beach fl reply september   at  pm sarah admin hi laurna thanks for your questions i’m emailing you and publishing the comments because your questions are good a every family has one entrepreneur matt is our entrepreneur i am not we still work together i am part time but many people work on their own it just depends on your situation b full time people make more money and learn faster we encourage that but there is an exception to every rule we have had several part timers do very well with this business c i asked matt and he said that there is a wide variation based upon effort skill training etc our revenues were k first year k second year and k rd year we have balanced all of the business based upon our training program as well some trainees have made more and others less it just depends i guess i’m sorry i can be more detailed d matt has never charged a nonprofit in fact he is helping a new church on thursday when you are profitable and successful our prayer is that you’ll share and help the local nonprofits for free we pray that is helpful to you sarah reply september   at  pm miguel desoto i just wanted to come back and say thank you we received our package in the mail today and the kids wanted to open it lol it was like christmas in san antonio love the wrapping paper job and i wanted to tell you it worked you replied to my email already but we laughed so hard at the wrapping paper i had to tell you you guys rock for jesus reply september   at  pm sarah admin hi miguel thanks for your reply you know what is funny is that this was matt’s idea and the first time we shipped the packages out i had to take them to the post office i had two or three boxes like the picture below and i had people actually asking me if they could have one not knowing there was just a book and dvd inside matt said that if the people were asking for them then it must be a good envelope reply september   at  am richard kneider i am interested in getting information about what you are offering so my wife and myself can continue to serve others reply september   at  pm sarah admin hi richard just a reminder to get request the dvd and book please use the request form here your shipping addresses are printed on a label machine and thus the system will add you to the database we

through the years i have also seen dozens of business models and i have to say that this is the most organized and one of the best ideas i have seen in a very long time i wanted to let you know that

seeing happen with the community i saw your registration and application come through and look forward to getting to know you guys many blessings and thanks again reply october   at  pm matt admin here’s a few other questions i’ve received – yes this business is virtual and can be run from any location in the world with internet and phone access it is not limited to the usa yes the book and dvd is an outline of our model and is training for the program yes there is free training provided the next class is in october no you don’t need to buy anything from us to learn this business and you’ll see there is no option for purchasing anything in the private area it will take about  days to get your book and dvd yes we ship real books and dvds but you’ll get access to digital versions as well yes some information is kept private on this website due to customer confidentiality agreements that i have we don’t publish our phone number on this website because we were getting too many calls asking us to explain the business our phone numbers business information and more proof case studies and testimonials are all published inside of the private area and other other websites which you’ll learn about when you request the book and dvd  of your questions will be answered with the book and dvd reply december   at  pm chloe knudsen dear matt and sarah i am a nurse and was seriously injured in an automobile accident and am now unable to be hired for a nursing position all they see when i go to an interview is my limp and my cane i have been praying that god would send me a way to make some income online as well as help other people too although i cannot work directly as a nurse my goal is to help others i have been duped with other work from home scams so i pray that you are offering a legitimate way of earning an income that is legal and honest thank you and god bless chloe knudsen bsn rn cpn reply december   at  pm matt admin thanks chloe you will see that we don’t offer mentoring or allow anyone to spend money unless they pass a detailed application all business information is offered for free inside of the private area if you’re a good fit you’re welcome to apply for mentoring we said a prayer for you today chloe hang in there 🙂 reply december   at  am ray mills hello matt my name is ray and i too have a desire to start a home based business i am a born again christian of many years and am as skeptical as the next i have been looking for a “work from home opportunity” many years and have tried a number of ventures i keep saying the same thing over and over there must be a legitimate opportunity on the net but can’t find one i hope and pray yours is the one sincerely ray mills reply january   at  pm brian mart you are very careful not to reveal any detail about your so called offer  of online offer are scams or pyrimid offers or whatever send me an email and tell me what you are trying so hard to hide… and i will reuest your book and video thanks brian reply january   at  pm matt admin brian if you don’t want the book and dvd then you don’t have to request it someone else will while it is tempting to get defensive about what we are doing and the why… people can be their own judge if you want the book and dvd then request it if not no problem there are several reasons we don’t share everything on this website including customer privacy however that will make sense if you request our book and dvd sarah and i gives these away for free and we’re not forcing anyone here reply february   at  am james dunson please send me you free dvd reply february   at  am matt admin fyi james you have to request it – that goes for everyone we look at comments only once in a while please request it by completing the form many of you are posting your address here – if you want the free resources please request them online by filling out the form thanks reply february   at  am joann hello matt and sarah…i have been checking online for added income and was glad to see your info for christians as i have left this journey up to god in my prayers i have read all the info and other comments so that i don’t waste your money and time will you answer the following for me even though i know that it will be in the info that you will be sending out does this involve working with people and businesses and churches the reason that i ask this is that we live in a very small town of less than  people and  to  hours from larger towns thank you and god bless your efforts joann reply february   at  pm matt admin hey joan yes it is included in the resources but it does involve working with people businesses churches etc we are consultants and that is all covered in the bookdvd you do not have to work with only local businesses i have worked with clients in seattle and the uk it is virtual of course so don’t worry about the small town reply february   at  pm carl hi matt and sarah i just went thru the steps on ordering my dvd and books great praise the lord there are still good christians doing the right thing helping others i can’t believe some of the comments about one inperticular that stated that nothing is for free my sister suppose to be a christian to and she says the same thing but what they don’t realize things coming from god’s work is free thank you both i am a disable evangelist i have to use a walking cane and doctors says i can’t work but god says he has work for me on the internet and i believe that is why i came across your website is because god directed me to it may god bless you both reply february   at  pm matt admin thanks carl 🙂 people can be critical… but if i stay caught up with what everyone thinks i would not be able to do what we’re doing everyone is skeptical i guess part of the territory some will request the book and dvd some won’t it doesn’t really matter to us we’re praying for the right people thx again for the comment reply march   at  pm matt admin yes we’re still offering the free resources in  we ship packages out about once per week thanks reply march   at  pm jerry i am a believer but i have been scammed before being a christian does not exclude us from that aspect of life i believe in people and the good nature that god instills in us what you’re doing is admirable and i applaud you and your family for sharing may god continue to bless you and the work he has prepared for you thanks jerry pastor and schoolteacher reply april   at  pm matt admin fyi guys – if you have a detailed question click on the contact us link at the top we’re only checking and
