philosophy – naples global advisors investment philosophy ngas investment philosophy is built around the following three key tenets  to first understand a clients objectives and capacity for risk we then seek to effectively manage the first level of the riskreturn equation through proper asset allocation  to build logically diversified portfolios using a global opportunity set of publicly traded securities that are vetted and then thoughtfully assembled using a fundamental valuation discipline  to administer portfolios with a view toward long term absolute returns and principal stability with an ongoing awareness of and sensitivity to the ever changing dynamics of global economies capital markets and clients’ personal circumstances ngas core equity philosophy is focused on a security’s valuation relative to peers to the overall market and to its historical metrics the key company characteristics used in the initial screening process include high and consistent return on equity low levels of debt low relative valuation and a history of sharing profitability with equity holders through consistent and growing cash dividends this is first accomplished with quantitative screens that allow for identification of a more manageable grouping of stocks that can then be analyzed more fundamentally once identified for inclusion in the portfolios a diverse by sector geography and capitalization grouping of publicly traded businesses are then assembled on an accountbyaccount basis and actively monitored for progress nga’s conviction is that value oriented investment disciplines have historically provided the highest risk adjusted returns nga’s core fixed income philosophy is centered around reducing overall portfolio volatility and providing for principal stability and high current yields relative valuation plays an integral component as nga portfolio managers seek to exploit inefficiencies adding yield that is frequently over looked by institutional managers we typically will not take excessive duration maturity or credit risk in fixed income positions recognizing the superior results normally available from equities for similar levels of risk fixed income segments will be diversified among treasury and government agency debt corporate and municipal bonds and supplemented by select exchangetraded and closedend funds hybrid and securitized debt securities are also utilized as yield enhancers home john m suddeth jr cfa – naples global advisors john m suddeth jr cfa bs finance auburn university mba georgia state university john has  years’
