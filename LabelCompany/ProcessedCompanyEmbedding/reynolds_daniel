photo galleries music puts imagine dragons’ brother “on top of the world” november   by ali noorda      arrow aja dan and coulter reynolds visit oregon in august of  dan reynolds’ band imagine dragons rose to fame while little brother coulter served his mission in el salvador coulter reynolds is now studying communications at byu photo courtesy coulter reynolds two years ago in el salvador byu student coulter reynolds heard an imagine dragons song on the radio at a local wendy’s he was serving a mission at the time and figured his zone leader who shared his hometown of las vegas was playing a trick on him there was no way that imagine dragons an upandcoming band headed by his older brother dan reynolds would be playing on the radio — especially in el salvador it turns out his zone leader wasn’t playing a trick at all coulter’s parents friends and siblings had been keeping a big secret imagine dragons had recently hit it big in the united states — so big it was headed to the grammys later that year little brother coulter was “extremely proud” but success and family support are nothing new for the reynolds family when asked to describe the reynolds family coulter’s longtime best friend jason bedford had one word successful “because both of their parents are really smart and have such strong moral values they were naturally successful” said bedford a sophomore at uvu studying biology “their mom was really into them playing piano too because she always believed that it helped with the brain and helped them with their studies and whatnot” all nine of the reynolds kids were required to take “at least” piano until age  coulter said his sister sarah bleazard who graduates in december with a degree in elementary education explained that while not all of the reynolds children aspired to be musicians they never wanted to give up music as a hobby according to bleazard at one point or another they all played in bands thanks to their mom their good taste in music comes from their dad but their overall success is a family business “i am super lucky” bleazard said “i’m not trying to brag but i was born into a family that is constantly supportive they thrive off of helping someone they thrive off helping the sibling’s success” bleazard said when dan comes on the radio her mom christene reynolds is the first to say “that’s my son” but her support isn’t just for her famous children older brother dr brandon reynolds returned to hometown las vegas to open a plastic surgery practice a few years before imagine dragons took off christene headed straight to a local mall to spread news about her son business cards in hand she approached each kiosk in the mall she would agree to try vendors’ products if they would agree to listen to her spiel on her product — her son bleazard said the eight reynolds brothers have inherited the supportive gene “if coulter said ‘i really love donuts’ and that’s what he wanted to do my brothers would be the first one to fund him and tell everyone he has the best donuts” bleazard said the ronald and christene reynolds family circa  as of today the reynolds childrenhave  nieces and nephews who all live in las vegas nevada photo courtesy coulter reynolds for now donuts are not in coulter’s future music success and family are however following the footsteps of three of his seven older brothers coulter a sophomore studying public relations and doubleminoring in spanish and logic hopes to attend law school he plans to later manage bands in las vegas under his father’s law firm the four other reynolds brothers attended medical school and currently practice in las vegas even bleazard now resides in las vegas working a desk job for her brother while finishing her byu degree online before he heads to law school coulter will spend his summer with his brother following imagine dragons on its north american tour dan whom he described as his confidante and best friend invited him as soon as he returned home from his mission “i feel like a little kid that gets christmas over and over again every day” coulter said “i’d say you’d find me front row but there won’t be much room there so you’ll probably find me wherever there is space enough to dance and shake my booty” coulter said his parents now in their mids attend every show they can make it to “mom will be right there singing and dancing to all the words and if mom and dad don’t go the next day they watch the entire show together” he said from basement bands to law school and the grammys one thing is certain the reynolds family is the star of the show when it comes to supporting each other’s success soundcloud url”httpsapisoundcloudcomtracks″ params”autoplayfalsehiderelatedfalseshowcommentstrueshowusertrueshowrepostsfalsevisualtrue”
