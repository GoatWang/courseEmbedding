starboard delivers letter to depomed shareholders recommences the process to call a special meeting of shareholders for removing and replacing the current depomed board with a modified slate of six highly qualified nomineesintends to submit today a new record date request notice to depomed and file preliminary proxy materials with the sec for soliciting requests to call a special meetingreiterates significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies questionable capital allocation decisions and egregious actions by the board to stymie strategic interest news provided by starboard value lp may    et share this article new york may   prnewswire  starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard one of the largest shareholders of depomed inc nasdaq depo with an ownership interest in approximately  of depomeds outstanding shares today announced it has delivered an open letter to depomed shareholders and intends to recommence the process for calling a special meeting of depomed shareholders for removing and replacing the current depomed board of directors with a modified slate of six highly qualified director nominees the full text of the letter follows may   dear fellow shareholders starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard currently has an ownership interest in approximately  of the outstanding shares of depomed inc depomed or the company making us one of the companys largest shareholders  we believe that depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the board of directors the board to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders unfortunately as we outlined in our previous letter to depomed on april th we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies questionable capital allocation decisions and egregious actions taken by the board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring depomed we believe the board clearly lacks the independence objectivity and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders to that end we will be delivering to depomed today a new written request in accordance with depomeds bylaws that the board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting the record date request notice for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current board this record date request notice supersedes our initial request delivered to depomed dated april   the initial record date request notice  as you may recall the initial record date request notice was delivered to depomed in order to preserve our rights under california law and mitigate the risk that depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights since delivering the initial record date request notice we have undertaken an extensive process to carefully vet a slate of highlyqualified nominees that included the evaluation of over  qualified potential candidates we have selected a group of six candidates possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to depomeds business and current challenges including pharmaceutical operations healthcare regulatory finance board governance and oversight and mergers and acquisitions expertise collectively our slate of director nominees has decades of experience serving on wellperforming public company boards importantly this group of nominees if elected at the special meeting is prepared to serve the shareholders of depomed and ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance we appreciate that the board promptly set a record date in response to our initial record date request notice thereby demonstrating that it does not intend to unnecessarily delay the calling of a special meeting by shareholders while we also appreciate the boards intentions in amending its  poison pill rights plan poison pill to facilitate our delivery of the requisite requests from shareholders in order to call the special meeting there are other considerations as a d filer that make us uncomfortable with the idea of soliciting and delivering requests from other depomed shareholders without conducting a public solicitation therefore today we are filing preliminary proxy materials with the sec in furtherance of soliciting the requisite requests to deliver the special meeting request our expectation is that the board will adhere to a similar timetable in setting a record date for this record date request notice as it did with our initial record date request notice and we look forward to calling a special meeting of shareholders in the near future we are confident that you will find the team of professionals we are nominating to be incredibly wellqualified to serve as directors of depomed we have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees below over the coming weeks and months we intend to share our detailed views on depomed and look forward to engaging with you as we approach the special meeting of shareholders highlights of starboards nominees biographies in

expressed its belief that the companys common stock is deeply undervalued and that meaningful opportunities exist to unlock significant value based on actions within the control of management and the board  starboard also noted the companys dismal stock price performance dating back to its ipo in   according to starboard this destruction in stockholder value is a direct result of the companys weak operating performance deteriorating margins and poor capital allocation decisions around internal investments and poorly executed acquisitions  starboard urged mips to discontinue pursuing

has delivered a letter to the company nominating a slate of highly qualified candidates for election at the companys  annual meeting including robert kramer jeffrey s mccreary jeffrey c smith and

 this morning we delivered a letter to the company formally nominating four highly qualified candidates for election to the board of directors the board at the companys  annual meeting   we believe that mips common stock is deeply undervalued and that meaningful opportunities exist to unlock significant value based on actions within the control of management and the board  despite a highly profitable royalty stream marketleading technology and valuable intellectual property mips stock has dramatically underperformed over an extended time period  the director nominees we have proposed have the requisite skill sets to assist the board in evaluating opportunities to improve performance and shareholder value   as shown in the table below mips stock price performance has been dismal

spending on research and development and sales and marketing revenue has actually declined over the last four consecutive quarters and is expected to continue to decline over the coming year  this

shareholder we have serious concerns regarding the significant deterioration in financial performance and the lack of action to stem the decline in revenues and operating profits  further we are deeply troubled by the apparent willingness of the board to consider using the companys cash to pursue acquisitions in light of a terrible acquisition track record and an operating business in need of serious and immediate attention as a reminder on august   mips announced the acquisition of chipidea microelectronica sa chipidea for an aggregate value of  million plus assumed liabilities  prior to the announcement mips shares were trading at   as a result of this acquisition the company depleted its entire  million of net cash and swung to a net debt balance of  million  the stated rationale for the transaction was to strategically enter highgrowth segments where analog is essential and that mips expected to reap significant sales growth from the new partnership the chipidea acquisition proved to be a massive failure  mips financial results deteriorated and the stock fell to  per share at its low  lower than where the company was trading prior to the chipidea acquisition  less than two years later on may   mips sold chipidea to synopsis for a mere  million less than  of the original  million purchase price  mips stated unfortunately after two big quarters the analog market went into a sharp downturnaffecting our entire business and that the limited ability of our balance sheet to absorb that shock is driving this decision given the disastrous results of the chipidea acquisition and the many years of poor financial performance we strongly encourage the board to reconsider its stance on capital allocation  instead of pursuing acquisitions the company should focus on improving its operating performance and consider allocating capital to buy back shares of mips at the current deeply discounted valuation  we believe this is the best use of excess cash and will significantly benefit shareholders   further we believe that mips intellectual property may hold substantial value  to that end we strongly encourage the board to explore alternatives for realizing that value for the benefit of all shareholders we look forward to continuing to share our views with you  it should be clear that our nominees are uniquely qualified to assist the board in evaluating the topics covered in this letter and in taking the necessary steps to enhance shareholder value  we are happy to engage in a constructive dialogue with you in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable resolution that will serve the best interests of all shareholders   best regards jeffrey c smith partner starboard value lp certain information concerning the participants starboard value lp
