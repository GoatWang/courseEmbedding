a parish  means that he is the first priest listed in the official catholic directory usually the pastor and that there is a total of two priests at the parish the shorthand  means that the priest is listed third on a fourpriest roster see our sample page from the directory note the official catholic directory aims to report the whereabouts of catholic priests in the united states on january  of the directorys publication year our working assumption is that a priest listed in the directory for a given year was at the same assignment for part of the previous year as well however kenedy and sons will sometimes accept updates well into the year of publication diocesan clergy records are rarely available to correct this information the directory is also sometimes misleading or wrong we have tried to create an accurate assignment record given the source materials and their limitations assignment records are a work in progress and we are always improving the records that we post please email us with new information and corrections this assignment record collates sullivans career history as it is represented in the official catholic directory with allegations as reported in the media we make no representation regarding the truth of the allegation we report and we remind our readers that the us legal system presumes that a person accused of or charged with a crime is innocent until proven guilty similarly individuals who may be defendants in civil actions are presumed not to be liable for such claims unless a plaintiff proves otherwise admissions of guilt or liability are not typically a part of civil or private settlements for more information see our posting policy this assignment record was last updated on aug   guide of business management sytem guide
