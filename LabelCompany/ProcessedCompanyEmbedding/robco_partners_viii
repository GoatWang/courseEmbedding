out of his inheritance by his brother by  the now  year old massachusetts institute of technology graduate managed to make it one of the most profitable corporations on earth thanks to his business acumen and technical genius robert deliberately structured the company like a maze to obfuscate his role and allow robco to effectively hide their practices the companys aggressive expansion policies coupled with the high quality of their products have given it a practical monopoly in crucial segments of the software market by  their unified operating system mf boot agent and retros bios were the de facto industry standard for terminals and mainframes across the states within a year their robcos became the standard for militarygrade security systems as well their broad range of robots including the eyebot protectron and sentry bot lines were one of the most common types of robotics before the war rivaled only by general atomics internationals own product lines in certain fields however robco was unmatched one of those was robert mayflowers stealth boy reverse engineered sometime between  and  from captured chinese technology of course the company was concerned about its public image a sinister megacorporation doesnt inspire confidence or loyalty to educate the public and make it friendlier to the american consumer robco invested in exhibits and intense public relations campaigns like the joint robcogeneral atomics exposition at the museum of technology hostile takeoversedit  edit source the company was known to acquire valuable assets through any means necessary one such asset was repconn aerospace robco acquired the company after a year of buying shares from  to  when steeples allies turned against him the vice president tried to rally the board again and sought help from masters but while the cfo officially agreed to support him she was actually working with general manager piers isley to sell the company citing the profit of a merger with robco not to mention avoiding a hostile takeover and a much less amicable transition isley and masters managed to undermine steeples position in the company and get the board of directors to pass a vote of no confidence against steeple after he refused to even consider selling his part of the company in order to maintain their independence and integrity failing the vote steeple stepped down from his position as vice president carl rook transferred from robcos security division became the next vice president focusing on improving the security within the company robert house ceo of robco used the newly acquired company for a weapons research program for colonel moretti of the us military repurposing repconns proprietary plasma rocket propulsion system of course some companies werent taken

prestigious joint venture was military contract  in cooperation with general atomics international robco was contracted to collaborate on an unprecedented joint project the creation of the most powerful combat robot in the history of warfare to liberate anchorage alaska from chinese occupation in a display of power meant to demoralize the enemy and force them into submission the project was meant to serve both military and propaganda needs the former dictated the capacity the latter the design in the words of general constantine chase initiator of the project liberty prime was to embody the american military a walking talking nuketossing hero reminding enemies of the us that they picked a fight with a global super power confident that the project would soon yield result general chase

including potential nonplayer character companion sergeant rl the parking lot is also a random encounter location inhabitants include mole rats radroaches and protectrons there are a number of unused protectrons which remain in their charging stations and a few nukacola vending machines on the various levels layoutedit  edit source robco factory flooredit  edit source the first room that you walk into has five protectrons on display in various positions two of which will be more specialized and in the spotlights one being a nukacola protectron and the other will be a militaryissued protectron the other three are standard protectrons two rooms on the left are restrooms to the northwest theres a small room with two storage closets with minor loot and ammunition to the right of the entrance two paths the left path going to a room with a few lockers and shelves that then leads to a larger room which seems to be a small part of the assembly line for the robots to the right of where you enter the room is a much smaller room with a workbench after this room are some stairs that lead to overlooking the previous large room the right path is simply a flight of winding stairs that also lead to overlooking the large room offices and cafeteriaedit  edit source when you enter this room there will be two pool tables and the right one having a couch on it there are two nukacola fridges and one refrigerator to the right if you go left from this room there will be a long hallway as youre going through the hallway there should be a mannequin there are three ammunition boxes there a little further theres a gate that isnt locked with a leaf blower and two lawn mower blades right before the hallway ends there is a room to the left in there is a first aid box and not much else if you go straight from the first room then youll see a small cafeteria with four tables on the right to the left is the counter in that room theres a first aid box and some refrigerators two ovens and two lockers continuing from this room you can go straight or turn left to the left and another left there is a small room where the first hallway ended and past that there is another room minor caps and loot turning left and then going straight you go upstairs but ill cover a little later if you right of the original room then there will be a short hallway with restrooms on either side past that there is the office with four office spaces with minor loot from there theres a hallway with three rooms on the sides the first looks like an officestorage the second room is a larger office with four desks and file cabinets the last room is again an officestorage with several boxes and a first aid box now continuing upstairs it makes like a trident pattern the left path theres a storage closet and past that is a small monitor room with two lockers the right path is the same but a bit more destroyed the storage closet is caved in and the monitor room messed up lastly continuing straight from the stairs is the main computer room for the whole building theres a first aid box and a prewar book in there notable lootedit  edit source factory flooredit  edit source lying congressional style on reception desk at the back of the foyer where you enter there is a prewar book on the bookshelf behind this desk big books of science by the protectron pod area to northeast on console there is a prewar book nearby stealth boy  on a desk next to a steam gauge assembly in the easternmost room if you go straight whwen entering the facility you will enter the office by headings straight its on

the wasteland survival guide notesedit  edit source when entering the facility turn right then left inside the room there are two wooden shelves with six ammunition boxes in two of the crates there is a good chance to find two stealth boys as soon as you enter the facility you will notice two restrooms on your left in the restroom closest to the main entrance you will find a broken protectron seated on the toilet in the stall in the far left corner of the room similarly in the same restroom of the broken protectron there is a skeleton with a camera and  prewar money looking under the stalls in the alcove between the door and the wall when placing mines near inactive protectron storage cell if protectron is still inside and the mines touches the outside wall it will detonate immediately appearancesedit  edit source robco facility appears only in fallout  behind the scenesedit  edit source one of the notes on the computer ends with the infection has been removedthe soul of this machine has improved and is signed b bell this is in reference to the song archetype by fear factory whose lead singer is burton c bell and the chorus of the song contains the lyric the infection has been removed the soul of this machine has improved bugsedit  edit source all protectrons destroyed inside the area with the mainframe can be looted twice once the first time you enter the area and when you have attached the device to the mainframe all protectrons can be looted again this does not count for the protectrons on the factory floor there are numerous garage doors you can open look like food dispensers but bigger but nothing actually happens they register as open and closed and can be activated to toggle between the two  but there is no accompanying animation sound or passage to go through with some tricky jumping the ones on the walls can do the same the mainframe processor can be activated and hacked from behind this will keep you hidden from the robot that activates in the mainframe room if for some reason you decided to hit some of the deactivated protectrons while you were looting them causing their corpse to gib when you reactivate them their parts will try to ineffectively join back to them resulting in strange one legged or headless protectrons roaming the halls this has no effect on game play and the bulk of the protectrons move normally despite the lack of a walk animation this also has the problem of their arms being stuck in the roof so they are unable to shoot their target xbox  playstation  immediately after entering the door to the cafeteria area from the factory floor youll notice in the pod to the left that the protectrons arms slowly move down to its sides even though its supposed to be deactivated many of the radroaches tend to get stuck in the walls and the piles of waste on the ground the game may crash when selecting the stress testing option in the mainframe computer be sure to save the game before using the mainframe xbox  on the nd floor of the cafeteria level if you go left once you go up the stairs there is a small room with a locked footlocker in it at the back of the room is a set of fallen shelves and a metal box it is possible to get stuck if you jump over the shelves to reach the box galleryedit  edit source references ↑ fallout  official game guide game of the year edition p  close to tenpenny tower is a
