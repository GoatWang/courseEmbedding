that includes new resource drilling at vms deposit budget for ambler road seen as modestshane lasleymining newsnovacopper inc plans to invest roughly us million over the next two to three years on finalizing a feasibility study for its arctic deposit the next step toward the exploration companys vision of developing mines at the worldclass copper projects found in the ambler mining district of northwest alaska arctic is the most advanced of the upper kobuk mineral projects a venture formed by novacopper and nana corp the alaska native regional corporation that represents the ińupiat of northwest alaska this partnership brought together the arctic deposit and dozens of similar volcanogenic massive sulfide prospects located on novacoppers public and private mining claims with bornite and a number of other mineral prospects on nanaowned lands located a mere  miles apart arctic and bornite are each considered worldclass copper assets that would have long since been developed if not for their remote location some  miles off the beaten path in northwest alaska it is believed that advancing these deposits in tandem will improve the economics of both since formation of the upper kobuk mineral projects at the end of  novacopper has expanded bornite to  billion pounds of copper in a march  resource averaging roughly  percent copper in less than three years our exploration team has increased sixfold the scale of the bornite deposit when combined with our highgrade potentially openpit resource at arctic we have nearly achieved our initial objective of defining approximately  billion pounds of copperequivalent resources in the ambler district novacopper president and ceo rick van nieuwenhuyse said in releasing the latest bornite resource estimate last march with bornite showing its worldclass potential novacopper is now focused on finishing what it started at arctic we see arctic as the first mine to be developed and bornite as the second and we will work on the synergies between the two projects van nieuwenhuyse told mining news arctic feasibilityarctic was originally envisioned to be developed as an underground mine this plan however was predicated on the idea that the vms deposit would be developed as a standalone operation once a part of the upper kobuk mineral projects however the idea of openpit mining this copperrich deposit began to emerge the viability of such an operation was affirmed in a preliminary economic assessment completed in  over a year minelife outlined in the pea a metrictonperday mill at arctic is anticipated to produce  million pounds of copper  million lbs of zinc  lbs of lead  million oz of silver and  oz of gold initial capital to build a mine at arctic is estimated to be us million another us million in sustaining capital and us million in closing costs also are anticipated the basecase scenario for the pea uses longterm metal prices of uslb for copper us centslb for zinc us centslb for lead usoz for silver and usoz for gold using these price assumptions the mine would produce roughly  million lbs of copper per year at us cents per lb with the other metals calculated as a byproduct as a result this scoping level study finds that the openpit mining scenario at arctic would produce an aftertax net present value  percent discount of us million an aftertax internal rate of return of  percent and would pay back the capital expenses in about five years novacopper plans to refine and potentially improve the project economics as it completes a feasibility study for arctic scheduled for completion as early as  to finish this study novacopper intends to carry out an us to usmillion program at the upper kobuk mineral projects in  this work which is currently slated to begin by june will focus primarily on infill drilling aimed at upgrading inferred resources in the proposed arctic openpit from to the measured and indicated categories the openpit for arctic encompasses an indicated resource of  million metric tons averaging  percent  billion lbs copper  percent  billion lbs zinc  percent  million lbs lead  grams per metric ton  oz gold and  gt  million oz silver additionally arctic has an inferred resource of  million metric tons averaging  percent  million lbs copper  percent  million lbs zinc  percent  million lbs lead  gt  oz gold according to the pea it will only take about  meters of drilling to upgrade the inferred resources to measured and indicated another roughly  meters is needed to gather the geotechnical hydrological and metallurgical data needed to complete the feasibility study novacopper which ended its  fiscal year nov  with us million in working capital will need to raise additional funds to complete all of the drilling and other programs on the docket for  van nieuwenhuyse says it would be more efficient to complete all of this work in one fieldseason but realizes that it could be tough to raise the required funds in the current markets depending on whether it takes one or two field seasons to complete the majority of this work novacopper anticipates the feasibility study to be completed in  or  bornite synergywhile the  program will primarily focus on advancing arctic to a project that can be presented to banks and permitting agencies novacopper intends to continue to investigate the viability of mining bornite which has been the primary focus of novacoppers exploration since the  season we will continue to work on bornite but probably at a little slower pace van nieuwenhuyse said the potentially openpittable portion of the project contains indicated resources of  million metric tons grading  percent  million pounds copper and inferred resources of  million metric tons grading  percent  billion pounds copper and the deeper potentially underground minable portion of bornite contains inferred resources of  million metric tons grading  percent  billion pounds copper while novacopper did not complete any new drilling at bornite in  crews relogged and resampled roughly  meters of core from  holes drilled by kennecott copper co between  and  during its tenure at bornite kennecott was focused on the highest grade components of the deposit and overlooked lower grade mineralization for novacopper these lower grade portions of the deposit could potentially convert to reserves in an openpit mining scenario for bornite to find the overlooked copperbearing portions of the deposit novacopper sampled  meters of untested core this exercise identified five historical holes with grades topping  percent copper and another  with intercepts of more than  percent copper the program also reaffirmed results from kennecotts previous assay work by resampling  meters of core already tested by its predecessor at bornite previous work by kennecott which focused on the narrow highgrade copper intervals has been confirmed by novacopper van nieuwenhuyse said upon release of the assay results in october this years program serves as an excellent quality control tool in relation to the historic results and also builds upon the  and  relogging and resampling campaigns to improve resource continuity by addressing zero grade gaps in the resource model we expect this updated data set to form the basis for determining the ultimate pit configuration and design at bornite if novacopper raises sufficient funds the company would like to drill about five additional holes at bornite this year novacopper is tentatively planning to complete a pea of bornite in  a scoping level study that will assist the evaluation of synergies with arctic and mark the first engineering step toward developing what would become the second highgrade copper deposit in the ambler district ambler roadthe viability of developing arctic and bornite rests largely on establishing a transportation corridor between the ambler mining district and alaskas road system located some  miles to the east the state of alaska began studies on the potential of building a road to the ambler district in  these studies initially carried out by the alaska department of transportation and public facilities were transferred to the alaska industrial development and export authority in  aidea which is wellsuited to arrange publicprivate partnerships entered into a memorandum of understanding with novacopper this agreement paves the way for the quasistateowned authority to investigate various ways to fund the construction and maintenance of the ambler road and create the framework by which novacopper will repay the investment from mines developed at the roads terminus in april  aidea was given the goahead by its board of directors to begin the permitting process for the ambler road and to engage a firm to prepare the environmental impact statement for the project under the direction of the federal agencies the authority is now seeking direction from alaska lawmakers alaskas new gov bill walker however included no additional funding for the ambler road in the budget he recently submitted to the state legislature aidea which has money set aside for the project does not need funding during the states current budget cycle the authority however will need roughly us million to finish an environmental impact statement and associated permits during the next two years aidea has asked the governor and legislators if it should proceed with permitting in  delay the project or scrap it all together the authority reasons that the state risks losing money already invested along with jobs and other economic benefits that mines in the ambler region would bring if the plug is pulled on the endeavor van nieuwenhuyse argues that lumping the proposed ambler road into a pile of big budget statefunded projects collectively known as megaprojects is an unfair characterization of what is being proposed from a state spending standpoint it is not a megaproject he explained it is in the neighborhood of us million to permit the project so it has a fairly modest budget construction of the road anticipated to cost us million to  million would be funded privately through the sale of bonds and repaid by users of the road a similar arrangement for the delong mountain transportation system a road and port facility linking the red dog zinclead mine to world markets has proven to be a good investment for aidea and the state above paying back the costs and potentially turning a profit these infrastructure projects support economic growth and diversification in alaska which is aideas primary objective did you find this article interesting tweet itdigg it print this story  email it to an associate click here to subscribe to mining news north of  for as low as  per

properties in the ambler mining district of northwest alaska is having a tough time this year its share price is down substantially since january and last month the company recorded a loss when it put out its secondquarter results it said at the time that substantial doubt exists as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern as the continued operations and exploration activities of the company are dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing within the next twelve months from an investor standpoint thats certainly a troubling statement however its worth noting that during that period novacopper also reduced its expenses and lowered its q and halfyear net losses in a yearoveryear comparison further the company is still seeing support from market watchers and its largest shareholders case in point just before last months results were released those shareholders put up cash for the entirety of novacoppers recent private placement leaving the company funded for the rest of the year — at least in terms of exploration activities meanwhile in an august  article from seeking alpha the investment doctor points to impressive economics at the companys arctic project including a cash cost of  per pound of copper and states that novacopper is trading at a fraction of its fair value and further achievements will unlock this value finally last friday novacopper
