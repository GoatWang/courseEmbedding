refinance rates now in ann arbor mi change this loan type home purchase home refinance home price  home price purchase when you get a mortgage to purchase a home the lender uses the lower of the agreedupon purchase price or the propertys appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount the loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loantovalue ratio or ltv that ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate if your ltv exceeds  percent youll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance which increases your monthly payment if the property appraises for less than the agreedon purchase price you are not usually required to complete the purchase home value  home value refinance this is your estimate of the current value of your property when you refinance your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser the refinance loan amount divided by the propertys appraised value equals your loantovalue ratio ltv and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate to get an accurate refinance rate quote your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate down payment  down payment the down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount the higher your down payment the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan if your down payment is less than  percent of the purchase price youll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance which increases your monthly payment mortgage balance

judging from early market trends it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge up today however those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day so a sharper rise a holding steady or even a fall all remain possible our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic political and geopolitical news that might affect the american and global economies including this mornings domestic economic data – durable goods orders and international trade in goods were better than expected though the former figure was inflated by onetime orders for aircraft meanwhile the weekly jobless numbers were mildly disappointing the us treasury will be auctioning year notes at  pm et skittishness ahead of tomorrows announcement of the first estimate of gross domestic product figures for s second quarter events on capitol hill as the us senate continues to debate health care reform to some the credibility of president trumps wider business and tax agenda is at stake if we were currently buying a home we would lock our rate now at least if we had to lock anyway within the next couple of weeks read on to discover why you might prefer to float average rates for year fixedrate mortgages inched down yesterday giving some relief after tuesdays sharp rise they remain close to where they were between july  rates could fall again but there is no guarantee of that what happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming hours and days absent other factors good news tends to push mortgage rates up while bad news usually pulls them down many experts would urge you to lock now particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks others might suggest you continue to float providing you have time to ride out the coming nearinevitable ups and downs they perceive junes and early julys rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying us economy but neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility so either way you are taking a chance only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable mortgage rates in the news today further falls in mortgage rates may be on the cards today mortgage rates might fall today – maybe significantly potential for mortgage rates to move significantly today but which way mortgage rates look set to fall again today mortgage rates look likely to fall or hold steady today what does it mean to lock your mortgage locking your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan once your loan is locked thats the rate and price you get regardless of what happens in the financial markets if rates go up youre protected but if rates go down you wont benefit either  you close your loan at the rate youve locked and you can’t change it locks have expiration dates ranging from  to  days or more and the longer your lock period the more it costs if you dont close your loan on time you could end up paying a higher interest rate when should you lock you can lock in your loan at any time during the process until you lock your interest rate you are said to be floating your mortgage the only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance the decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice that’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage

purchase a home the lender uses the lower of the agreedupon purchase price or the propertys appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount the loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loantovalue ratio or ltv that ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate if your ltv exceeds  percent youll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance which increases your monthly payment if the property appraises for less than the agreedon purchase price you are not usually required to complete the purchase home value  home value refinance this is your estimate of the current value of your property when you refinance your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser the refinance loan amount divided by the propertys appraised value equals your loantovalue ratio ltv and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate to get an accurate refinance rate quote your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate down payment  down payment the down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount the higher your down payment the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan if your down payment is less than  percent of the purchase price youll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance which increases your monthly payment mortgage balance home type single family town house condo multifamily coop credit score  credit score your credit score is a number designed to measure your

rate lock recommendation july    lock todays outlook judging from early market trends it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge up today however those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day so a sharper rise a holding steady or even a fall all remain possible our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic political and geopolitical news that might affect the american and global economies including this mornings domestic economic data – durable goods orders and international trade in goods were better than expected though the former figure was inflated by onetime orders for aircraft meanwhile the weekly jobless numbers were mildly disappointing the us treasury will be auctioning year notes at  pm et skittishness ahead of tomorrows announcement of the first estimate of gross domestic product figures for s second quarter events on capitol hill as the us senate continues to debate health care reform to some the credibility of president trumps wider business and tax agenda is at stake if we were currently buying a home we would lock our rate now at least if we had to lock anyway within the next couple of weeks read on to discover why you might prefer to float average rates for year fixedrate mortgages inched down yesterday giving some relief after tuesdays sharp rise they remain close to where they were between july  rates could fall again but there is no guarantee of that what happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming hours and days absent other factors good news tends to push mortgage rates up while bad news usually pulls them down many experts would urge you to lock now particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks others might suggest you continue to float providing you have time to ride out the coming nearinevitable ups and downs they perceive junes and early julys rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying us economy but neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility so either way you are taking a chance only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable mortgage rates in the news today further falls in mortgage rates may be on the cards today mortgage rates might fall today – maybe significantly potential for mortgage rates to move significantly today but which way mortgage rates look set to fall again today mortgage rates look likely to fall or hold steady today what does it mean to lock your mortgage locking your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan once your loan is locked thats the rate and price you get regardless of what happens in the financial markets if rates go up youre protected but if rates go down you wont benefit either  you close your loan at the rate youve locked and you can’t change it locks have expiration dates ranging from  to  days or more and the longer your lock period the more it costs if you dont close your loan on time you could end up paying a higher interest rate when should you lock you can lock in your loan at any time during the process until you lock your interest rate you are said to be floating your mortgage the only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance the decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice that’s why we offer a
