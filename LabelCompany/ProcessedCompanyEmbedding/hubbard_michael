reuters on publish date june  6 photo by pool photo by todd j van emst watch in times video » embed michael g hubbard the speaker of the alabama house of representatives whose sharpelbowed approach to politics propelled the republican party to dominance in his state was convicted friday on  felony ethics charges leaving him stripped of power and facing the possibility of decades in prisonthe verdict at the end of mr hubbard’s trial in the lee county circuit court deepened the political crisis in alabama where some of the most influential state officials are facing inquiries and threats of ouster in recent weeks the troubles of mr hubbard who had wielded a level of influence that easily rivaled gov robert bentley’s power played out in public as prosecutors portrayed him as financially desperate privately frustrated and criminally culpable for misconduct under the very ethics law he had helped to strengthenalthough jurors acquitted mr hubbard on  counts his conviction on the remaining dozen charges prompted his removal as the leader of the house mr hubbard who was convicted of improperly soliciting benefits from lobbyists and voting in favor of a measure that helped a company for which he consulted faces up to  years in prison on each count“we hope that this verdict tonight will restore some of the confidence of the people in the state of alabama” said w van davis who oversaw the public corruption inquiry that led to mr hubbard’s indictment in october  advertisement continue reading the main story mr hubbard 5 had denounced the indictment from almost the moment it was released and he and his lawyers argued that he had done nothing illegal particularly because some of the lobbyists with whom he communicated were personal friends the charges they said amounted to a political assault on a strongwilled elected official who often seemed to have as many enemies in the capital as he did friends continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story mr hubbard intends to appeal but he is expected to be sentenced next monthhis conviction and automatic ouster immediately increased the political turmoil that had shadowed alabama for months and made it something of a punch line the chief justice of the state supreme court roy s moore could be removed from office this year because of his efforts to resist samesex marriage and mr bentley is a subject of impeachment proceedings over an improper relationship with an aide as well as federal and state inquiries“it’s a sad day in the state because people have a distrust in government when you look around all three branches” state senator cam ward a republican said in an interview after the verdict was announced “this kind of affirms what people have been thinking”mr bentley declined to comment through a spokeswoman but the state’s attorney general luther strange also a republican welcomed the verdict“this is a good day for the rule of law in our state” said mr strange who added that the decision “should send a clear message that in alabama we hold public officials accountable for their actions”after the verdict the associated press reported mr hubbard spoke with his team of lawyers including a former lieutenant governor before a deputy escorted him from the courtroomjurors began their deliberations friday afternoon and worked into the night punctuating a

how he had sent emails essentially pleading for consulting work mr hubbard’s emails were flashed onto a screen and dissected while he sat between his lawyersmr bentley testified as did former gov bob riley whose appearance became so tense that a prosecutor asked that he be deemed a hostile witness judge jacob a walker iii who will sentence mr hubbard declined to make such a declaration advertisement continue reading the main story business leaders also appeared as witnesses — and were asked to discuss why they had each invested  in mr hubbard’s struggling printing company — and so did a former state senator who testified under an immunity agreementprosecutors said mr hubbard had abused the power of his office“he just didn’t want to be held accountable to the law” a prosecutor matt hart said last month in his opening statementdefense lawyers who called mr hubbard as their only witness argued that he had taken steps to ensure that he complied with ethics standards and that his efforts to find work were permissible because he had contacted longtime friends“he tried to follow every part of the ethics law” a defense lawyer bill baxley said in the first hours of the trialmr hubbard’s prosecution was a crucial test for the ethics law which republicans had championed after they under mr hubbard’s leadership took control of the legislature in “this legislation that was passed in  was needed and prosecutors used it to convict based on violations of the law” said paul demarco a former republican lawmaker “this may be a black eye on the state of alabama but i think all eyes will be on the alabama legislature now”addressing reporters outside the courthouse on friday mr davis would not discuss other public corruption investigations“this is probably the first time in recent history that someone at this level in state government has been prosecuted” he said in an apparent reference to cases brought by alabama officials “for that reason i think it makes a statement”
