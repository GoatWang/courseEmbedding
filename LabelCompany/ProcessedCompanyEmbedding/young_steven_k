dr steven pollack left holds a dprinted robohand a prosthetic for children with amnionic banding syndrome an illness that can prevent fingers from developing in children research engineer james coburn right uses the d printer background in his work in the fda lab the snaptogether robohand prosthetic was invented by south african carpenter richard van as and made available for free on the internet before printing the hand can be individually sized and all connecting pieces are also printed the device can now be printed for less than  a hospital in michigan implants a d printed medical device into a monthold boy with a rare bronchial condition and saves a young life a man has  percent of his skull replaced with a d printed implant d printing—the process of making a threedimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model—is making headlines these days and the technology once considered the wave of the future is rapidly becoming part of the present it’s spurring innovation in manufacturing dramatically reducing the time required to design new products and allowing designs to be built that were not possible before here at fda we’re using it to expand our research efforts and expand our capabilities to review innovative medical products in fact d printing is fast becoming a focus in our practice of regulatory science—that is the science of developing new tools standards and approaches to assess the safety effectiveness quality and performance of fdaregulated products with d printing the conversion from a virtual computer model to a physical object can occur almost in real time the printer translates virtual models into digital crosssections for use as a blueprint for printing laying down successive layers in different shapes james coburn adjusts the tension on the feed mechanism for the abs plastic filament that is the raw material for the rapman kit d printer two laboratories in the fda’s office of science and engineering laboratories osel are investigating how the technology may affect the manufacturing of medical devices in the future at our functional performance and device use laboratory we’ve developed and adapted computermodeling methods to help us determine the effect of design changes on the safety and performance of devices when used in different patient populations the d technology enables us to tweak the design in ways large and small and to see precisely how those tweaks will change both fit and functionality in an era of increasingly personalized medicine which involves the development of treatments that are tailored to an individual patient or a group that shares certain characteristics including anatomical features it helps us to finetune our evaluation of patientfitted products at our laboratory for solid mechanics we’re investigating how different printing techniques and processes affect the strength and durability of the materials used in medical devices what we’re discovering will be valuable to our reviews of devices down the road it will help us to develop standards and set parameters for scale materials and other critical aspects that contribute to product safety and innovation in august  president obama launched the national additive manufacturing innovation institute namii a national effort bringing together industry universities and the federal government to provide innovation infrastructure to support new technologies and products created with additive manufacturing the formal term for d printing fda has a long history of researching and regulating innovative technological practices regulators regularly review some of the newest technologies coming onto the market and through our research fda has firsthand knowledge of these advanced techniques so we can evaluate advanced technology at an early stage—a crucial step in facilitating innovation and protecting the public health we will continue to facilitate device innovation and keep on the cutting edge of technology and regulatory science to help ensure that the products we regulate are safe and effective to see more photos of how fda is using d printing technology visit our flickr
