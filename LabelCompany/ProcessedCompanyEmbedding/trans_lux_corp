in october  after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in mexico furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room and enlisted the aid of a friend arthur payne a former employee of thomas edison payne hit upon the idea of rear projection projecting an image through a screen rather than on it however this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed moving lightedit in  furber formed american lux latin for light products and three years later using a fine highquality natural silk it created its first successful screen with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches it was only after a visit to the new york stock exchange that furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection at the time brokers obtained the latest stock quotes provided by western unions telegraph or wire service from a glass dometopped ticker the machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage prior to this invention any stock information was handwritten usually on a chalk board although the results were less immediate they were better displayed furber combined the best aspects of both methods by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen in  the company installed the first movie ticker ticker tape projection system at the new york stock exchange like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers it is this stock ticker that provided the companys name translux meaning moving light financing this new operation required more capital so furber took his company public on august   it was listed on the new york curb exchange which later became the american stock exchange until being delisted in  translux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the american stock exchange in  the company had  installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country moving picturesedit by  the company had created a much larger commercialsized theater screen and took it along with its rear projector system and a new wideangle lens to the motion picture industry to further penetrate the market the translux movies corporation in partnership with rko radiokeithorpheum studios was created using translux as its trade name it began a theaterbuilding program the first translux theater at th street and madison avenue in new york city was actually converted from retail space and featured larger seats more leg room and wider aisles than the average theater of the day seating only  it was much too small for the crowd it attracted the rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth in accordance with its news heritage the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of shorts usually comedy routines or musical numbers and newsreels when the companys third theater opened two blocks away on th and madison on november   it was turned back into retail space in  percy furber turned over company operations to his son percy by this time translux had  stockholders over  employees and was valued at  million in  the company opened two more newsreel theaters in brooklyn new york and one in philadelphia three more locations were added over the next three years with architect thomas w lamb designing the theater in washington dc offering  seats covered in blue leather its lobby decorated with sports murals by new york artist andre hudiakoff it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning located one block away from the white house it was considered to be the most elegant art deco theater in the capital up until its untimely demolition in  in  the company shortened its name to the translux corporation along with other theaterrelated businesses it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump returning veterans were attending college on the gi bill marrying and starting families newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home a car and new appliances ahead of going to the movies the companys declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing firstrun feature films in  but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop from  million in  to  million by  when the american public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies as this postwar middleclass began moving from the cities to the suburbs shopping complexes to support them proliferated and theaters followed in  translux built its first shopping center theater an seat facility in reisterstown road plaza mall in baltimore by  the company had brought large modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings and by  had  theaters in ten states by the end of the s the theater building boom was over as well in  translux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years the boom had aggravated the newly independent industrys problem of a shortage of quality movies bidding on films became fierce and many companies split their single theaters into twins three screen and four screen theaters began appearing and when richard brandt replaced percy furber as chairman of the board in  the multiplex trend with as many as  screens was in full swing some of the companys theaters were split into two and three screen houses and others were sold off entirely in the midst of this translux went into the business of multimedia shows the  premiere of the san francisco experience a projector sevenscreen spectacular with  special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly  million budget multimedia entertainment film about new york city the september   opening of the projector screen film was called bedazzling and breathtaking by the new york times the new york experience which was housed in a subbasement of the mcgrawhill building in rockefeller center became the longestrunning commercial multimedia show in history until its demise in  despite its popularity the show—which featured panoramic movie screens slide projections extensive light and sound systems and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of nathan hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs by  transluxs theater holdings were reduced to  screens concentrated in the northeast particularly connecticut by the mids the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western us bringing the companys total to  screens in  the firm opened its own los angelesbased film booking office televisionedit by  television had become americas most popular form of entertainment in  there were only  television sets in the us two decades later nine out of ten homes had at least one set translux soon began developing specialized rearprojection equipment for television studios greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with teleprocess screens and projectors when closed circuit television cctv appeared in the late s translux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information and formed an electronics division to develop and sell cctv systems in  they also developed a television program syndication service and in association with adventure cartoon productions produced the popular animated childrens series felix the cat and the mighty hercules the expanded business required translux to move from its brooklyn headquarters to a larger fivestory building in long island city in  they commissioned titra studios a new york city recording company that provided english translations for foreign movies to americanize the new japanese animated series speed racer for domestic television translux retained the series until  when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers transluxs film catalog was purchased by independent distributor alan gleitsman whose alan enterprises continued to syndicate speed racer to independent tv stations throughout the s that same year the company moved its headquarters again this time relocating to norwalk connecticut as for the translux library gleitsman left the syndication business in  and sold his assets to a colorization company called color systems technology which in turn sold the library which includes the alan enterprisestranslux library the rights to speed racer and the adventure cartoon productions series to broadway video in  due to bankruptcy stock quotes and signageedit in  translux purchased a patent for a remotecontrol signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs it also joined forces with the artkraft strauss sign corporation which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the great white way of broadway by  it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers radio stations and publishers throughout the country at the same time translux had  stockticker projectors and  news projectors in the united states plus another  in canada by the early s translux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information the companys fortunes were tied to its old systems twostep process the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising with an electronic ticker display translux could bypass the printing stage creating a realtime immediate information system in  the company was shocked by the introduction of a new foot  mlong electronic display installed on the trading floor of the new york stock exchange by a competitor recognition equipment inc rei of dallas even though the ultronic letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing translux tickers for several years the new york stock exchange installation was cause for concern as translux had enjoyed a longstanding business relationship with the exchange the company made a deal with rei since translux needed recognitions technology and they needed transluxs knowledge of how to market stockticker equipment they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the recognition system two years later they announced the translux jet named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign it was the highest quality realtime continuous flow wall display yet produced and a new method of viewing uptotheminute stock market sales information its tenfoot size made it perfect for brokerage offices but perhaps the best news for translux was that it no longer needed to rely on the western union ticker us and canadian brokerage houses ordered more than  translux jets in the first six months and translux opened an international office in zurich switzerland to deal with overseas orders by mid about  jets were in use shortly after introducing the jet translux applied the same innovations to closedcircuit television the jets popularity required translux to find a larger production facility in  the company moved to norwalk connecticut demand for jets continued to grow longer versions of   and  feet  m were produced in  translux had succeeded in reducing the size of the jet to onefifth of the original ten years later by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip the company reduced the jet to onetwentyfifth of its original size as successful as the jet was it failed to address one important segment of the stock market large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings when a chicagobased company quotemaster later extel developed an experimental prototype for a selective readout device translux approached them the company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device now called the personal ticker which could be programmed to monitor up to  stocks on a single exchange by  translux began installing the product for private investors portfolio managers pension fund administrators investment advisors and individual brokers that same year the strong bull market abruptly ended drastically impacting installations of all types of translux equipment following the market decline translux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry and decided to diversify the company formed an industrial sales department in  under the leadership of louis credidio who went after the commodity market and in  sold an adaptation of the personal ticker the t to the chicago board of trade soon translux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges capturing a small but significant new market when extels teleprinter terminal sales boomed it contracted translux to manufacture keyboards and waystation selectors which led to transluxs entry into the teleprinter market credidio studied the telex terminal field and by  translux began marketing a telex terminal the translux teleprinter tlt to several industries more than  terminals were installed by  diversificationedit early in  translux acquired integrated systems engineering inc a full service electronic sign manufacturing company to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities such as those found on billboards or outside truck stops banks and sports arenas the companys capacity to produce electronic displays increased in  when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in utah the indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community but now theaters museums hotels corporations and military hospitals were customers the division experienced a growth spurt in  when the australian gaming control board approved transluxs serial slot controller for sale in their country that decision also boosted sales of the led jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers translux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals pharmacies and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays in  the cincinnati reds installed the companys new rainbowribbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard pitchers board and outoftown game board in their new seat stadium great american ball park at an estimated cost of over  million the rainbowribbon™ uses translux unique xfs scaling which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of led displays the three hundred feet of display in the reds installation featured over  pixels in an  billion color led matrix and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias the displays smoothly transition between video advertising animations scoringstatistic layouts and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility the system also featured a  x  spectralens™ pitch count board and a giant  x  spectralens scoreboard which in  when the park opened was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date the scoreboard located in the left outfield is capable of displaying game scores graphics animations player statistics advertising and general information translux continued to supply ledincandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams such as the san francisco giants in addition to professional baseball translux has provided displays and equipment

preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap is the assumption that an entity will continue in existence as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations and the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities occurring in the ordinary course of business  this principle is applicable to all entities except for entities in liquidation or entities for which liquidation appears imminent  in accordance with this requirement the company has prepared its accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements assuming the company will continue as a going concern      table of contents   we do not have adequate liquidity including access to the debt and equity capital markets to operate our business  the company incurred a net loss of  million in the three months ended march   and had a working capital deficiency of  million as of march    as a result our shortterm business focus continues to be to preserve our liquidity position  unless we are successful in obtaining additional liquidity we believe that we will not have sufficient cash and liquid assets to fund normal operations for the next  months  in addition the companys obligations under its pension plan exceeded plan assets by  million at march   and the company has a significant amount due to its pension plan over the next  months  the company is in default on its ¼ limited

was not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant related to its credit agreement hereinafter defined which noncompliance was waived by the lender  as a result if the company is unable to i obtain additional liquidity for working capital ii make the minimum required contributions to the defined benefit pension plan iii make the required principal and interest payments on the notes and the debentures andor iv attain and maintain compliance with all debt covenants there would be a significant adverse impact on the financial position and operating results of the company  the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty  see note   longterm debt for further details   the company is seeking additional financing in order to provide enough cash to cover our remaining current fixed cash obligations as well as providing working capital  however there can be no assurance as to the amounts if any the company will receive in any additional financings or the terms thereof and the company has no agreements commitments or understandings with respect to any such additional financing  to the extent the company issues additional equity securities it could be dilutive to existing shareholders  in addition the companys current outstanding debt and other obligations could limit its ability to incur more debt   note   inventories   inventories consist of the following

furber an englishman who moved to the united states in october  after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in mexico furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room and enlisted the aid of a friend arthur payne a former employee of thomas edison payne hit upon the idea of rear projection projecting an image through a screen rather than on it however this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed moving lightedit in  furber formed american lux latin for light products and three years later using a fine highquality natural silk it created its first successful screen with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches it was only after a visit to the new york stock exchange that furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection at the time brokers obtained the latest stock quotes provided by western unions telegraph or wire service from a glass dometopped ticker the machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage prior to this invention any stock information was handwritten usually on a chalk board although the results were less immediate they were better displayed furber combined the best aspects of both methods by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen in  the company installed the first movie ticker ticker tape projection system at the new york stock exchange like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers it is this stock ticker that provided the companys name translux meaning moving light financing this new operation required more capital so furber took his company public on august   it was listed on the new york curb exchange which later became the american stock exchange until being delisted in  translux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the american stock exchange in  the company had  installations on

the results were less immediate they were better displayed furber combined the best aspects of both methods by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen in  the company installed the first movie ticker ticker tape projection system at the new york stock exchange like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers it is this stock ticker that provided the companys name translux meaning moving light financing this new operation required more capital so furber took his company public on august   it was listed on the new york curb exchange which later became the american stock exchange until being delisted in  translux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the american stock exchange in  the company had  installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country moving picturesedit by  the company had created a much larger commercialsized theater screen and took it along with its rear projector system and a new wideangle lens to the motion picture industry to further penetrate the market the translux movies corporation in partnership with rko radiokeithorpheum studios was created using translux as its trade name it began a theaterbuilding program the first translux theater at th street and madison avenue in new york city was actually converted from retail space and featured larger seats more leg room and wider aisles than the average theater of the day seating only  it was much too small for the crowd it attracted the rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth in accordance with its news heritage the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of shorts usually comedy routines or musical numbers and newsreels when the companys third theater opened two blocks away on th and madison on november   it was turned back into retail space in  percy furber turned over company operations to his son percy by this time translux had  stockholders over  employees and was valued at  million in  the company opened two more newsreel theaters in brooklyn new york and one in philadelphia three more locations were added over the next three years with architect thomas w lamb designing the theater in washington dc offering  seats covered in blue leather its lobby decorated with sports murals by new york artist andre hudiakoff it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning located one block away from the white house it was considered to be the most elegant art deco theater in the capital up until its untimely demolition in  in  the company shortened its name to the translux corporation along with other theaterrelated businesses it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump returning veterans were attending college on the gi bill marrying and starting families newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home a car and new appliances ahead of going to the movies the companys declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing firstrun feature films in  but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop from  million in  to  million by  when the american public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies as this postwar middleclass began moving from the cities to the suburbs shopping complexes to support them proliferated and theaters followed in  translux built its first shopping center theater an seat facility in reisterstown road plaza mall in baltimore by  the company had brought large modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings and by  had  theaters in ten states by the end of the s the theater building boom was over as well in  translux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years the boom had aggravated the newly independent industrys problem of a shortage of quality movies bidding on films became fierce and many companies split their single theaters into twins three screen and four screen theaters began appearing and when richard brandt replaced percy furber as chairman of the board in  the multiplex trend with as many as  screens was in full swing some of the companys theaters were split into two and three screen houses and others were sold off entirely in the midst of this translux went into the business of multimedia shows the  premiere of the san francisco experience a projector sevenscreen spectacular with  special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly  million budget multimedia entertainment film about new york city the september   opening of the projector screen film was called bedazzling and breathtaking by the new york times the new york experience which was housed in a subbasement of the mcgrawhill building in rockefeller center became the longestrunning commercial multimedia show in history until its demise in  despite its popularity the show—which featured panoramic movie screens slide projections extensive light and sound systems and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of nathan hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs by  transluxs theater holdings were reduced to  screens concentrated in the northeast particularly connecticut by the mids the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western us bringing the companys total to  screens in  the firm opened its own los angelesbased film booking office televisionedit by  television had become americas most popular form of entertainment in  there were only  television sets in the us two decades later nine out of ten homes had at least one set translux soon began developing specialized rearprojection equipment for television studios greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with teleprocess screens and projectors when closed circuit television cctv appeared in the late s translux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information and formed an electronics division to develop and sell cctv systems in  they also developed a television program syndication service and in association with adventure cartoon productions produced the popular animated childrens series felix the cat and the mighty hercules the expanded business required translux to move from its brooklyn headquarters to a larger fivestory building in long island city in  they commissioned titra studios a new york city recording company that provided english translations for foreign movies to americanize the new japanese animated series speed racer for domestic television translux retained the series until  when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers transluxs film catalog was purchased by independent distributor alan gleitsman whose alan enterprises continued to syndicate speed racer to independent tv stations throughout the s that same year the company moved its headquarters again this time relocating to norwalk connecticut as for the translux library gleitsman left the syndication business in  and sold his assets to a colorization company called color systems technology which in turn sold the library which includes the alan enterprisestranslux library the rights to speed racer and the adventure cartoon productions series to broadway video in  due to bankruptcy stock quotes and signageedit in  translux purchased a patent for a remotecontrol signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs it also joined forces with the artkraft strauss sign corporation which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the great white way of broadway by  it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers radio stations and publishers throughout the country at the same time translux had  stockticker projectors and  news projectors in the united states plus another  in canada by the early s translux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information the companys fortunes were tied to its old systems twostep process the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising with an electronic ticker display translux could bypass the printing stage creating a realtime immediate information system in  the company was shocked by the introduction of a new foot  mlong electronic display installed on the trading floor of the new york stock exchange by a competitor recognition equipment inc rei of dallas even though the ultronic letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing translux tickers for several years the new york stock exchange installation was cause for concern as translux had enjoyed a longstanding business relationship with the exchange the company made a deal with rei since translux needed recognitions technology and they needed transluxs knowledge of how to market stockticker equipment they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the recognition system two years later they announced the translux jet named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign it was the highest quality realtime continuous flow wall display yet produced and a new method of viewing uptotheminute stock market sales information its tenfoot size made it perfect for brokerage offices but perhaps the best news for translux was that it no longer needed to rely on the western union ticker us and canadian brokerage houses ordered more than  translux jets in the first six months and translux opened an international office in zurich switzerland to deal with overseas orders by mid about  jets were in use shortly after introducing the jet translux applied the same innovations to closedcircuit television the jets popularity required translux to find a larger production facility in  the company moved to norwalk connecticut demand for jets continued to grow longer versions of   and  feet  m were produced in  translux had succeeded in reducing the size of the jet to onefifth of the original ten years later by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip the company reduced the jet to onetwentyfifth of its original size as successful as the jet was it failed to address one important segment of the stock market large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings when a chicagobased company quotemaster later extel developed an experimental prototype for a selective readout device translux approached them the company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device now called the personal ticker which could be programmed to monitor up to  stocks on a single exchange by  translux began installing the product for private investors portfolio managers pension fund administrators investment advisors and individual brokers that same year the strong bull market abruptly ended drastically impacting installations of all types of translux equipment following the market decline translux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry and decided to diversify the company formed an industrial sales department in  under the leadership of louis credidio who went after the commodity market and in  sold an adaptation of the personal ticker the t to the chicago board of trade soon translux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges capturing a small but significant new market when extels teleprinter terminal sales boomed it contracted translux to manufacture keyboards and waystation selectors which led to transluxs entry into the teleprinter market credidio studied the telex terminal field and by  translux began marketing a telex terminal the translux teleprinter tlt to several industries more than  terminals were installed by  diversificationedit early in  translux acquired integrated systems engineering inc a full service electronic sign manufacturing company to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities such as those found on billboards or outside truck stops banks and sports arenas the companys capacity to produce electronic displays increased in  when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in utah the indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community but now theaters museums hotels corporations and military hospitals were customers the division experienced a growth spurt in  when the australian gaming control board approved transluxs serial slot controller for sale in their country that decision also boosted sales of the led jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers translux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals pharmacies and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays in  the cincinnati reds installed the companys new rainbowribbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard pitchers board and outoftown game board in their new seat stadium great american ball park at an estimated cost of over  million the rainbowribbon™ uses translux unique xfs scaling which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of led displays the three hundred feet of display in the reds installation featured over  pixels in an  billion color led matrix and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias the displays smoothly transition between video advertising animations scoringstatistic layouts and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility the system also featured a  x  spectralens™ pitch count board and a giant  x  spectralens scoreboard which in  when the park opened was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date the scoreboard located in the left outfield is capable of displaying game scores graphics animations player statistics advertising and general information translux continued to supply

by percy norman furber an englishman who moved to the united states in october  after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in mexico furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room and enlisted the aid of a friend arthur payne a former employee of thomas edison payne hit upon the idea of rear projection projecting an image through a screen rather than on it however this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed moving lightedit in  furber formed american lux latin for light products and three years later using a fine highquality natural silk it created its first successful screen with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches it was only after a visit to the new york stock exchange that furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection at the time brokers obtained the latest stock quotes provided by western unions telegraph or wire service from a glass dometopped ticker the machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage prior to this invention any stock information was handwritten usually on a chalk board although the results were less immediate they were better displayed furber combined the best aspects of both methods by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen in  the company installed the first movie ticker ticker tape projection system at the new york stock exchange like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers it is this stock ticker that provided the companys name translux meaning moving light financing this new operation required more capital so furber took his company public on august   it was listed on

space and featured larger seats more leg room and wider aisles than the average theater of the day seating only  it was much too small for the crowd it attracted the rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth in accordance with its news heritage the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of shorts usually comedy routines or musical numbers and newsreels when the companys third theater opened two blocks away on th and madison on november   it was turned back into retail space in  percy furber turned over company operations to his son percy by this time translux had  stockholders over  employees and was valued at  million in  the company opened two more newsreel theaters in brooklyn new york and one in philadelphia three more locations were added over the next three years with architect thomas w lamb designing the theater in washington dc offering  seats covered in blue leather its lobby decorated with sports murals by new york artist andre hudiakoff it was

including financial banking gaming corporate retail healthcare sports and transportation contents  early history  moving light  moving pictures  television  stock quotes and signage  diversification  company divisions  public documents  notes  references  external links early historyedit the company was created by percy norman furber an englishman who moved to the united states in october  after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in mexico furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room and enlisted the aid of a friend arthur payne a former employee of thomas edison payne hit upon the idea of rear projection projecting an image through a screen rather than on it however this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed moving lightedit in  furber formed american lux latin for light products and three years later using a fine highquality natural silk it created its first successful screen with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches it was only after a visit to the new york stock exchange that furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection at the time brokers obtained the latest stock quotes provided by western unions telegraph or wire service from a glass dometopped ticker the machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage prior to this invention any stock information was handwritten usually on a chalk board although the results were less immediate they were better displayed furber combined the best aspects of both methods by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen in  the company installed the first movie ticker ticker tape projection system at the new york stock exchange like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers it is this stock ticker that provided the companys name translux meaning moving light financing this new operation required more capital so furber took his company public on august   it was listed on the new york curb exchange which later became the american stock exchange until being delisted in  translux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the american stock exchange in  the company had  installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country moving picturesedit by  the company had created a much larger commercialsized theater screen and took it along with its rear projector system and a new wideangle lens to the motion picture industry to further penetrate the market the translux movies corporation in partnership with rko radiokeithorpheum studios was created using translux as its trade name it began a theaterbuilding program the first translux theater at th street and madison avenue in new york city was actually converted from retail space and featured larger seats more leg room and wider aisles than the average theater of the day seating only  it was much too small for the crowd it attracted the rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth in accordance with its news heritage the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of shorts usually comedy routines or musical numbers and newsreels when the companys third theater opened two blocks away on th and madison on november   it was turned back into retail space in  percy furber turned over company operations to his son percy by this time translux had  stockholders over  employees and was valued at  million in  the company opened two more newsreel theaters in brooklyn new york and one in philadelphia three more locations were added over the next three years with architect thomas w lamb designing the theater in washington dc offering  seats covered in blue leather its lobby decorated with sports murals by new york artist andre hudiakoff it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning located one block away from the white house it was considered to be the most elegant art deco theater in the capital up until its untimely demolition in  in  the company shortened its name to the translux corporation along with other theaterrelated businesses it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump returning veterans were attending college on the gi bill marrying and starting families newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home a car and new appliances ahead of going to the movies the companys declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing firstrun feature films in  but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop from  million in  to  million by  when the american public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies as this postwar middleclass began moving from the cities to the suburbs shopping complexes to support them proliferated and theaters followed in  translux built its first shopping center theater an seat facility in reisterstown road plaza mall in baltimore by  the company had brought large modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings and by  had  theaters in ten states by the end of the s the theater building boom was over as well in  translux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years the boom had aggravated the newly independent industrys problem of a shortage of quality movies bidding on films became fierce and many companies split their single theaters into twins three screen and four screen theaters began appearing and when richard brandt replaced percy furber as chairman of the board in  the multiplex trend with as many as  screens was in full swing some of the companys theaters were split into two and three screen houses and others were sold off entirely in the midst of this translux went into the business of multimedia shows the  premiere of the san francisco experience a projector sevenscreen spectacular with  special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly  million budget multimedia entertainment film about new york city the september   opening of the projector screen film was called bedazzling and breathtaking by the new york times the new york experience which was housed in a subbasement of the mcgrawhill building in rockefeller center became the longestrunning commercial multimedia show in history until its demise in  despite its popularity the show—which featured panoramic movie screens slide projections extensive light and sound systems and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of nathan hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs by  transluxs theater holdings were reduced to  screens concentrated in the northeast particularly connecticut by the mids the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western us bringing the companys total to  screens in  the firm opened its own los angelesbased film booking office televisionedit by  television had become americas most popular form of entertainment in  there were only  television sets in the us two decades later nine out of ten homes had at least one set translux soon began developing specialized rearprojection equipment for television studios greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with teleprocess screens and projectors when closed circuit television cctv appeared in the late s translux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information and formed an electronics division to develop and sell cctv systems in  they also developed a television program syndication service and in association with adventure cartoon productions produced the popular animated childrens series felix the cat and the mighty hercules the expanded business required translux to move from its brooklyn headquarters to a larger fivestory building in long island city in  they commissioned titra studios a new york city recording company that provided english translations for foreign movies to americanize the new japanese animated series speed racer for domestic television translux retained the series until  when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers transluxs film catalog was purchased by independent distributor alan gleitsman whose alan enterprises continued to syndicate speed racer to independent tv stations throughout the s that same year the company moved its headquarters again this time relocating to norwalk connecticut as for the translux library gleitsman left the syndication business in  and sold his assets to a colorization company called color systems technology which in turn sold the library which includes the alan enterprisestranslux library the rights to speed racer and the adventure cartoon productions series to broadway video in  due to bankruptcy stock quotes and signageedit in  translux purchased a patent for a remotecontrol signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs it also joined forces with the artkraft strauss sign corporation which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the great white way of broadway by  it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers radio stations and publishers throughout the country at the same time translux had  stockticker projectors and  news projectors in the united states plus another  in canada by the early s translux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information the companys fortunes were tied to its old systems twostep process the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising with an electronic ticker display translux could bypass the printing stage creating a realtime immediate information system in  the company was shocked by the introduction of a new foot  mlong electronic display installed on the trading floor of the new york stock exchange by a competitor recognition equipment inc rei of dallas even though the ultronic letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing translux tickers for several years the new york stock exchange installation was cause for concern as translux had enjoyed a longstanding business relationship with the exchange the company made a deal with rei since translux needed recognitions technology and they needed transluxs knowledge of how to market stockticker equipment they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the recognition system two years later they announced the translux jet named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign it was the highest quality realtime continuous flow wall display yet produced and a new method of viewing uptotheminute stock market sales information its tenfoot size made it perfect for brokerage offices but perhaps the best news for translux was that it no longer needed to rely on the western union ticker us and canadian brokerage houses ordered more than  translux jets in the first six months and translux opened an international office in zurich switzerland to deal with overseas orders by mid about  jets were in use shortly after introducing the jet translux applied the same innovations to closedcircuit television the jets popularity required translux to find a larger production facility in  the company moved to norwalk connecticut demand for jets continued to grow longer versions of   and  feet  m were produced in  translux had succeeded in reducing the size of the jet to onefifth of the original ten years later by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip the company reduced the jet to onetwentyfifth of its original size as successful as the jet was it failed to address one important segment of the stock market large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings when a chicagobased company quotemaster later extel developed an experimental prototype for a selective readout device translux approached them the company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device now called the personal ticker which could be programmed to monitor up to  stocks on a single exchange by  translux began installing the product for private investors portfolio managers pension fund administrators investment advisors and individual brokers that same year the strong bull market abruptly ended drastically impacting installations of all types of translux equipment following the market decline translux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry and decided to diversify the company formed an industrial sales department in  under the leadership of louis credidio who went after the commodity market and in  sold an adaptation of the personal ticker the t to the chicago board of trade soon translux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges capturing a small but significant new market when extels teleprinter terminal sales boomed it contracted translux to manufacture keyboards and waystation selectors which led to transluxs entry into the teleprinter market credidio studied the telex terminal field and by  translux began marketing a telex terminal the translux teleprinter tlt to several industries more than  terminals were installed by  diversificationedit early in  translux acquired integrated systems engineering inc a full service electronic sign manufacturing company to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities such as those found on billboards or outside truck stops banks and sports arenas the companys capacity to produce electronic displays increased in  when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in utah the indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community but now theaters museums hotels corporations and military hospitals were customers the division experienced a growth spurt in  when the australian gaming control board approved transluxs serial slot controller for sale in their country that decision also boosted sales of the led jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers translux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals pharmacies and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays in  the cincinnati reds installed the companys new rainbowribbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard pitchers board and outoftown game board in their new seat stadium great american ball park at an estimated cost of over  million the rainbowribbon™ uses translux unique xfs scaling which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of led displays the three hundred feet of display in the reds installation featured over  pixels in an  billion color led matrix and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias the displays smoothly transition between video advertising animations scoringstatistic layouts and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility the system also featured a  x  spectralens™ pitch count board and a giant  x  spectralens scoreboard which in  when the park opened was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date the scoreboard located in the left outfield is capable of displaying game scores graphics animations player statistics advertising and general information translux continued to supply

retail healthcare sports and transportation contents  early history  moving light  moving pictures  television  stock quotes and signage  diversification  company divisions  public documents  notes  references  external links early historyedit the company was created by percy norman furber an englishman who moved to the united states in october  after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in mexico furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room and enlisted the aid of a friend arthur payne a former employee of thomas edison payne hit upon the idea of rear projection projecting an image through a screen rather than on it however this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed moving lightedit in  furber formed american lux latin for light products and three years later using a fine highquality natural silk it created its first successful screen with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches it was only after a visit to the new york stock exchange that furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection at the time brokers obtained the latest stock quotes provided by western unions telegraph or wire service from a glass dometopped ticker the machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage prior to this invention any stock information was handwritten usually on a chalk board although the results were less immediate they were better displayed furber combined the best aspects of both methods by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen in  the company installed the first movie ticker ticker tape projection system at the new york stock exchange like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers it is this stock ticker that provided the companys name translux meaning moving light financing this new operation required more capital so furber took his company public on august   it was listed on the new york curb exchange which later became the american stock exchange until being delisted in  translux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the american stock exchange in  the company had  installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country moving picturesedit by  the company had created a much larger commercialsized theater screen and took it along with its rear projector system and a new wideangle lens to the motion picture industry to further penetrate the market the translux movies corporation in partnership with rko radiokeithorpheum studios was created using translux as its trade name it began a theaterbuilding program the first translux theater at th street and madison avenue in new york city was actually converted from retail space and featured larger seats more leg room and wider aisles than the average theater of the day seating only  it was much too small for the crowd it attracted the rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth in accordance with its news heritage the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of shorts usually comedy routines or musical numbers and newsreels when the companys third theater opened two blocks away on th and madison on november   it was turned back into retail space in  percy furber turned over company operations to his son percy by this time translux had  stockholders over  employees and was valued at  million in  the company opened two more newsreel theaters in brooklyn new york and one in philadelphia three more locations were added over the next three years with architect thomas w lamb designing the theater in washington dc offering  seats covered in blue leather its
