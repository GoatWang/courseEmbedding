closely with the automotive industry they analyzed and comprehended the damaging effects of process variation on complex product assembly operations and concluded “a process which cannot be measured can never be effectively controlled or optimized” through revolutionary machine vision and pioneering engineering efforts they created a unique and innovative measurement solution that not only allowed fast and efficient containment of quality problems as they occurred but also provided the ability to proactively seekout and reduce process variation the final result was groundbreaking – the first viable inprocess  dimensional measurement solution capable of being deployed in the harshest of manufacturing environments world headquarters perceptron incplymouth mi  phone  email

perceptron launches scanrtm worlds first green cmm laserline scanner offering extended dynamic range capable of measuring reflective surfaces  for use with portable and fixed coordinate measuring machines scanr scan er represents the sixth generation of cmmlaser scanners from perceptron dramatically extending the range of engineering materials that can be laserscanned offering a significant customer advantage over red and blue laser scanners when scanning highly reflective and carbon fiber parts company release    am et plymouth mi  marketwired    perceptron inc nasdaq prcp for more than  years perceptron has pioneered the use of laser scanners on portable and fixed coordinate measuring machines with the fastgrowing application of d laser scanning for reverse engineering productionpart dimensional inspection and as a complement to d printing perceptron has introduced the worlds first green laserline universal cmm scanner highly reflective materials such as machined aluminum and carbon fiber composites have always been a challenge for laser scanners requiring part spraying with a powder coat which severely inhibits its practical use on repetitive production parts the new generation of scanr cmm laser scanner represents a technological breakthrough solving many of the ageold application problems associated with laser scanning and provides the following enhanced performances enhanced dynamic range wider coverage of color spectrum and reflectivity improved material coverage carbon fiber polished metal plated metal increased accuracy thinner laser line with higher signal to noise ratio improved edge detection subpixel optimization adjustable data acquisition rate for hq high quality and hs high speed operation large field of view and depth of view scanr
