program™ seo reputation management at its best stephen snyder contacted his lab life after bankruptcy email followers  years ago in early  with a business opportunity to become a bk advisor or junior partner for a specific territory you lived in for a fee  this was the second iteration of this business opportunity which was previously presented to his lab email followers in  however was cancelled by stephen due to his inability to assign specific territory boundaries as a follower of stephen for almost  years and attending his free live seminars several times over the course of my bk recovery during the past  years i felt the opportunity was legitimate and just what i was looking for in a home based business  i recovered the right way by following some of the practices stephen present at his live seminar and other things i had learned and was ready to help others recover form their bankruptcy filing and responded to his emails about submitting my story for his review  i was notified by stephen there were  people in the territory i lived in that were in the running to be awarded the territory and after waiting sometime i was selected and offered the opportunity to join the team and become a bk advisor  how excited i was to finally have a home based business that was something i knew about and could help others do what i did recover from my bankruptcy and purchase my first home  the initial offering included the assignment of a territory i lived in for a fee of approximately  and all the materials and support from him and his group as well as a host of hot leads from his live seminars for meetings i would host in my home or outside venue along with all the recordedlive videos for use at the home meetingsgatherings  as a long time follower and someone who participated in a one day event hosted by stephen in beverly hills several years before and giving my testimony of recovering and what i learned from stephen who presented himself like a responsible moral ethical business man i wanted into the program  he then offered something more which he called a master partnership which for a grand total of  you would of course get everything other standards partners were offered but there would also be cold leads from the live seminars special training and phone calls specifically directed to only master partners  since i was looking for a home based business that i could sink myself into and eventually trade off my full time job for this down the line i wanted the into the master program so i received a bonus at work and used this money to pay the full amount of  to stephen for a master partnership he initially started out with phone calls on a weekly basis with the master partners separate from the regular partners because we had special treatment  the calls lead into things we needed to purchase for the business like an apple tv ipod or nano and making sure we had internet service to display the liverecorded videos for our home meetings  he invited all the partners to his office in indiana in june  for an initial taping of the video we would show at the home meetings and all this was to lead to a launch of his live seminar for the fall  and then our lead would start pouring in and we could start contacting the leads for attendance to our home meetinggatherings  well just before the launch of the fall  live seminars stephen announced things were not ready and the he was postponing the launch and it would start up in the spring after his live seminars started up again  we were the st of many false hallow promises stephen made to his invested partners and to this date thats all weve had from stephen  the weekly phone calls tapered off to about once a month and then about once every two months and then sometime in  he finally confirmed he would be hosting a series of live seminars in only specific areas and mine happened to be one of them  however he wasnt ready to introduce us as his bk advisors and share this information with the attendees of these seminars about our program and the benefits they could derive from a one on one relationship by someone who was mentored and trained by stephen  this raised a red flag for me which now has only increased in size and height  hes done absolutely nothing for his invested business partners  hes continues to tell us the program will relaunch which is now coming in june   the question we all have is how can you relaunch something that never launched  he himself has gone through some personal conflicts in life and filed bankruptcy again moved to florida and spent over a year in a strategic deflaut of the home he purchase and bragged to us business partners about how he lived in this home rent free and then got a  figure check to move out of the house as part of his settlement for the strategic default  he was bragging to us like we should be proud of what he did  why does someone who teaches people how to recover from bankrupcty need to file bankruptcy again well take a look at the state of indiana public records inquiry and youll see why  for the past  years since our offered this program for sale hes had multiple lawsuits filed against him his business and his wife i started hosting conference calls last year in may  to try and bring the master partner bk advisors and jr partners together to see what we can do to get our money back  weve tried a few things and will continue in our persuit to have him prosecuted to the full extent of the law  stephen snyder is just another bernie madoff just on a smaller scale but in all just as corrupt and dishonest i hope that if you have heard of stephen snyder life after bankruptcy lab abf foundation or his allen michaels credit repair service you will not give them anything turn and run and run fast and far away  he is just like bernie madoff sweet talks you into something that doesnt exist take your hard earned money in what you believe is good faith and provides you nothing in return  no one else should be ripped off by stephen snyder ever again and it is my hope and desire that is made possible by the efforts we put forth to stop his fraudulent deceptive business practices you will see lots of comments from folks in this program on another website liars and cheats and they are all true  i was deceived by stephen and i will not stop my persuit of justice until its finished  he will be stopped and you have my word on this im looking for an attorney who would like to take on a class action lawsuit so if you see this posting and have an interest

disciplinary board recommending that loren c mccray be suspended from the practice of law for  days and that he be required to pay the costs and expenses of these proceedings in the amount of  app  mccray timely filed objections to the report with this court under rule f north dakota rules for lawyer discipline app  and disciplinary counsel also timely filed objections to the report under that rule app  the first of these two cases alleges various violations of the rules of professional conduct by mccray first as an employee of bradley ross law and later while acting as bradley ross law app  the second case against mccray alleges various violations of the rules of professional conduct more particularly with respect to dr michaela mckenzie a client of mccray and bradley ross law and by repeating some of the more general allegations in the first case app  mccray denied all of the alleged violations app  and on september   a hearing was had before the hearing panel app  mccray graduated from jamestown college in  and from und law school in  tr  he immediately got a job with the larson law firm in jamestown and practiced there for approximately three years tr  he then went to the solem law office in beulah in  tr  in march or april  mccray responded to an ad on the sband website which was asking for a consumer law attorney by emailing his resume to john mcmanus an attorney licensed in california and indiana and practicing law in indiana tr  discussions then were had between mccray and mcmanus about mccray becoming an employee of bradley ross law acting as a professional corporation in north dakota through a certificate of a foreign corporation tr  bradley ross law was a california corporation tr  mcmanus was practicing law in indiana under the trade name bradley ross law doing credit repair tr  in a lot of jurisdictions trade names cant be used for law firms and that includes indiana and there had been a complaint filed against mcmanus in indiana for using the trade name bradley ross law tr  lines  the ad had been placed on the sband website because it had been determined that north dakota was a state that allowed trade names for law firms and north dakota did not have a state credit repair organizations act croa tr  mccray went to indiana to visit mcmanus tr  mccray also met with dale mohlenhoff corporate counsel for bellwether inc a service provider to bradley ross law bellwether provided computer services marketing services a facility for the processing center and leased employees to bradley ross law tr  bellwether inc is primarily owned by one stephen snyder and his family tr   the facility and the employees of bradley ross law are located in fishers indiana at the time mccray went to first visit with mcmanus bradley ross law had about  leased employees legal assistants data entry people and some additional employees tr  these employees worked for bradley ross law under mcmanus disputing inaccurate items on peoples credit reports making requests directly to creditors with respect to inaccurate items making requests to creditors with respect to accurate items but asking them if they could delete them anyway and also responding to clients specific inquiries concerning items on their credit reports tr  mccray started as an employee of bradley ross law in the beginning of august  and found office space for bradley ross law and his own office as loren mccray attorney at law at  east broadway in bismarck bradley ross law pc was a foreign professional corporation california incorporated in the state of north dakota tr  app   see also letterhead at app  mccrays initial agreement with mcmanus provided that mccray work  hours per week at a salary of  per year tr  it wasnt a set  hours a week some weeks it could be up to  hours a week because i might go out to indiana for a week at a time some weeks it might be ten hours a week    tr  mccrays primary work would be to review client files and speak with clients over the phone do disputes on clients behalf because theres more than just disputing to the credit reporting agency theres other types of disputing and other types of letters that go out    tr  see also  lines  mccray and bradley ross law in north dakota was at all times linked with mcmanus and the processing center electronically videoconference with a t line and had access to all the client files which i was supposed to review and answer client inquiries tr  lines  mccray had moved from beulah to bismarck was also starting his own practice in bismarck and was also helping the solem law office in beulah technically ending that relationship on december   tr  mccrays own practice involves primarily bankruptcy work  or more and occasionally family law cases and criminal law cases tr   lines  mccray had no other bradley ross law employees in bismarck at the time of the hearing mccray had on average one employee per month for loren mccray attorney at law and did  to  bankruptcies per month tr   in  bradley ross law had gross receipts in the sum of  with an income loss of  app  see tr  in august  bradley ross law had approximately  clients tr  note it looks like a lot of the money collected by bradley law went to stephen snyder doing business as bellwether inc through all of the contracts discussed in this brief   on august   bradley ross law pc a professional corporation with its principal place of business at  east broadway avenue bismarck north dakota with john mcmanus as president owner and signatory entered into a series of contracts with bellwether inc or its affiliates app  the first contract was a services and infrastructure agreement the contract was with an affiliate corporation of bellwether incorporated in indiana and the contract was signed by dale mohlenhoff secretary of the affiliate corporation app  this contract was for leasing employees human resource services payroll services handling the employee benefits seminar services consulting services and miscellaneous services as far as the seminar services my recollection of this agreement that would be for the persons that would be at the seminar tr  the seminars were seminars put on by stephen snyder more fully described below the next contract was a software license and consulting services agreement with bellwether inc an indiana corporation signed by dale mohlenhoff as secretary app  this contract provided for the use of    a complex computer program and database thats used to manage all this stuff    the software was actually developed by bellwether inc   in order to be able to handle this number of clients and the way its handled this software system is used tr  lines  the next contract was a service mark license agreement with an affiliate a wyoming limited liability corporation signed by dale mohlenhoff as secretary of the affiliate corporation app  this contract dealt with the use of bradley ross law tr  lines  under the contract bradley ross law paid the affiliate a certain number of cents per client for the use of the name bradley ross law tr  lines  bradley ross law was a name associated with assisting people after bankruptcy and had numerous clients and the name has value to it and there was an agreement paid for to use that name and i believe thats  cents per client    tr  lines  the next contract was an equipment lease agreement with bellwether inc signed by mohlenhoff as secretary app  this contract was for leasing the equipment including all the computer equipment copiers scanners other types of office equipment which is actually on a really big scale for what we do tr  lines  the next contract was a service contract with an affiliate consumer disclosure inc an indiana corporation signed by stephen snyder as president app  this was an agreement with an entity that would provide credit reports merge credit reports for use with the services provided by bradley ross law tr  lines  consumer disclosure inc received from bradley ross law  per credit report obtained tr  bradley ross law charged clients the  tr  although clients could obtain their credit reports themselves for free this would take a week to ten days when the client paid the  bradley ross law obtained the reports right away and the other benefit to them is they got    their fico scores from the three credit reporting bureaus now if you go online to like myficocom and    do that theyre going to charge you  bucks and you get it here for a cheaper price and then brl would be able to start work right away tr  new clients were advised of these differences and that they did not have to order their credit reports through consumer disclosure inc approximately  percent of clients did tr  see tr  lines  the next contract was a master software license and services agreement with bellwether inc signed by mohlenhoff as secretary app  this contract was for the software manuals the software that was later developed or ordered by work order business system manuals software engineering services support services training services concerning the software tr  lines  compensation was a usage fee for each account tr  lines  the next contract was a marketing agreement with bellwether signed by mohlenhoff app  this agreement concerns any promotional materials for bradley ross law including the website brochures and sponsorship of seminars tr  lines  an example of the brochures was introduced as disciplinary counsels exhibit  a brochure from  or early  app  tr  also stephen snyder has an after bankruptcy foundation and conducts seminars through the foundation tr  bradley ross law would sponsor some of these seminars and pay for the sponsorship through this agreement tr  lines   the agreement provided that bradley ross law pay bellwether  per month for all marketing services tr  the final contract was a master advertising licensing and services agreement with bellwether signed by mohlenhoff app  this contract is a secondary advertising agreement rather than the marketing agreement tr  lines  the compensation was  for each account for which activities are provided in the first month and  for each account that recorded activities in an ongoing activity month tr  lines    note it looks like stephen snyder and bellweather were getting an awful lot of money from bradley ross law   disciplinary counsels exhibit  the brochure from  or early  described the process bradley ross law performed for clients app  the brochure first listed  easy steps to a more accurate credit report and higher fico credit scores app  the first step was to sign up for the services of bradley ross law the second and third steps were to purchase your three credit reports from the three credit reporting agencies and to mail them to bradley ross law upon receipt unless bradley ross law purchased the reports for you bradley ross law would then begin the dispute process step four was to mail to bradley ross law all resulting correspondence from each credit reporting agency upon receipt in response to our dispute letters you will begin to receive correspondence from each of the credit reporting agencies within  days    mailing labels with our address are provided in the front pocket of this folder for your convenience    step five was to repeat the process and step six was to check your fico credit scores every six months to determine any improvements in your scores the brochure goes on to state visualize the process of improving your credit reports as a continuous circle between you bradley ross law and the three national credit reporting agencies app  the brochure then describes the repetition of the dispute process the brochure specifically states there are no guarantees app  fico credit scores are explained app  the brochure states that the client can email or call to obtain the status of the case app  the brochure explains once weve received your credit reports we will construct and sign letters of dispute in your name these letters communicate your dispute in such a way that the credit reporting agencies will most likely accept the dispute and conduct an investigation app  the brochure informs the reader of the federal credit repair organizations act croa app  the brochure also informs the reader investigation results will arrive in the mail at your home from each credit reporting agency therefore when changes occur you will see them in the investigation results section of each updated credit report    app  the brochure also attempts to answer the question of how long the process will take each case is unique it would be improper for us to promise you a particular result within a specific time frame we suggest utilizing our service for at least  months or until you are completely satisfied with your results app  the brochure states a client can cancel services at any time in writing by email or by telephone with no penalty app  the brochure explains that disputing negative inaccurate outdated and unverifiable information on your credit reports is your right under section  of the fair credit reporting act credit restoration is as legal as pleading not guilty in a court of law anything inaccurate outdated or unverifiable on your credit reports must be deleted app  the brochure also explains it is possible to fix or restore your own credit report app  the brochure contained an application form app  at the hearing in these matters disciplinary counsel asked mccray what he did for clients of bradley ross law tr  lines  mccray responded and expounded on the brochure tr  included in his response mccray indicated that the brochure and application form has in fact been updated numerous times since exhibit  tr  a quality cd is now provided to clients to assist them in rebuilding their credit tr  bradley ross law also began an online service called casevalet once a clients credit reports are obtained the client can go online and specifically indicate what they want to dispute and why or they can state they do not want to dispute a certain item tr  once dispute letters are sent out the credit reporting agencies have  days to verify whether or not information on a credit report is accurate they can take another  days under certain circumstances tr  see also tr  line  through  line  the problem is if you dispute too many things at the same time or if you do it in certain fashions then the credit reporting agencies will declare the dispute to be frivolous or theyll send out what    we call negative stall letters so people trying to do this process on their own run into all sorts of difficulties because the letters they get from the credit reporting agencies can be really intimidating    even if    you run your credit report and theres ten wrong items in there if you dispute all ten the credit reporting agency is going to come back and say you made a frivolous dispute so    theres little tricks along those lines app  in late  as an employee of bradley ross law in the capacity already described above mccray had communications with dale mohlenhoff the corporate counsel for bellwether about the stephen snyder seminars and bradley ross law having people there to sign up clients tr  the communications involved what was appropriate and what was not appropriate tr  lines  mccray had researched ethics opinions and found one from utah that was closest on point that has the same or similar    ethical rules as north dakota see tr  app  mccray also reviewed a transcript of a seminar to decide what was appropriate and not appropriate tr  lines  mccray also communicated his opinions to snyder tr  what mccray determined was ethical was as follows bradley ross law could sponsor the seminars and have a booth particularly in a separate room the speaker can introduce the sponsors but there cannot be a recommendation that people hire the law firm the law firm can have brochures and other information available for people who want it the law firm can take applications from people who come up to their booth tr  see tr  lines  the idea is to make sure that a persons will is not overborne tr  lines  if the person on their own volition goes and asks for services then its my understanding that would be within the rules of professional conduct tr  lines  although there are no other law firms at his seminars tr  lines  stephen snyder never advertised bradley ross law snyder did seminars when bradley ross law was not there snyder sold books and did online stuff and all sorts of other stuff that bradley ross law has nothing to do with tr  there was no agreement that bradley ross law pay snyder or bellwether on a per person basis for any persons signed up tr  on january   mccray started bradley ross law pc a north dakota professional corporation and was a shareholder and employee of that corporation tr  app   at that time mccray also talked with mcmanus about purchasing mcmanus clients the clients of bradley ross law the california corporation but nothing happened with that sale until october  tr  lines   lines  in the meantime mccray and mcmanus kept their clients separate any new clients who came into bradley ross law came into the north dakota corporation also mccray went by the agreements of mcmanus with respect to payment of expenses to the various entities including bellwether for the north dakota clients tr  lines  see also tr  in  or the beginning of  mccray had researched ethics opinions and also sought the opinions of attorneys before adopting these contracts the ethics opinion he found most on point was one from the los angeles county bar association tr  app  on february   dr michaela mckenzie a dentist from georgia attended a stephen snyder credit after bankruptcy seminar at a hotel in atlanta georgia mckenzies bankruptcy was completed in december  and she received an invitation in the mail from stephen snyder in january  the seminar was free she presented her letter to get in there were approximately  people attending the seminar tr  the letter from stephen snyder did not mention bradley ross law tr  bradley ross law however was a sponsor of that atlanta seminar mccray was not personally present tr   indeed mccray has never attended a seminar conducted by stephen snyder tr  and first met him in person by happenstance at bellwether inc in april  tr  the bradley ross law people at the seminar would have been legal assistants and data analysts from the processing center in fishers indiana and two additional coordinators these people would have been personally instructed on their conduct by dale mohlenhoff after mccrays conversations with him tr   lines  there were other sponsors at this atlanta seminar they included ford motor credit a credit card company probably orchard a cpa firm which did tax work and a mortgage company these other entities would also pay snyder as a sponsor tr   mckenzie testified that the seminar was about an hour and one half to an hour and  minutes long in the seminar snyder talked about his own bankruptcy and how he was able to regain his credit scores by using an attorney to write letters for him to help him improve his credit rating    he recommended that we    copy his experience and his success of using a law firm and that if we wanted to we could use the law firm that he recommended which was bradley ross law he invited people to go to the back of the room to a different area and sign up with bradley ross law if they were interested in having them help them improve their credit scores tr  mckenzie described walking down a hallway to another room which had a bank of tables with about three or four people sitting behind them from bradley ross law she stated that at least  people went to this room and were in lines at the tables she stated accurately that bradley ross law was the only law firm at the seminar she did not recall any other entities or sponsors at the seminar tr  she did recall another room which she never went in tr  lines  when mckenzie got to the head of the line at a table she was asked if she would like to sign up she stated she would and she was handed an application she stepped away to the side and filled out and signed the application she did not discuss the contents of the application with any person from bradley ross law except that she asked that the date of payment be reflected to be the th of each month she received a copy of the signed application tr    see app  she also got something else from bradley ross law perhaps one of the brochures tr  with the application mckenzie became a client of bradley ross law the north dakota corporation tr  lines  the agreement provided that mckenzie would pay  per month to be taken directly from the financial account she provided with her first payment to be on march   tr   app  the agreement was clear that mckenzie could cancel at any time app  and provided a notice of cancellation form which also stated she could cancel at any time app  the application gave mckenzie the address and telephone number for bradley ross law and mccrays email address app  bradley ross law began work for mckenzie on march  and   which included a letter to mckenzie asking her to provide certain information app   on march   it appears bradley ross law ordered mckenzies three credit reports through consumer disclosure inc app  and mckenzies fico scores and credit reports were entered in their system on march   app  it appear that on march   bradley ross law mailed to mckenzie her credit score summary and fico scores app  see  on march   dispute letters were sent to the three credit reporting agencies and mckenzie was updated on the status of her case app  mckenzie did not communicate to bradley ross law items on her credit report she did not want disputed although her application and agreement called for her to do so see app  item  tr  lines  tr  however in response to the communication from bradley ross law that they received her credit report mckenzie replied in part a lot of the late payments that are listed are multiple student loans that were all clumped together under one payment and when one check did not get sent in on time it showed six late payments app  mccray testified that mckenzies student loans were disputed in all three of the letters sent on march   see tr  mccray also added that mckenzie was also getting her fico score reduced twice rather than once with respect to her student loan late payments because two different entities were reporting them as late tr  lines  on march   bradley ross law received from mckenzie the information requested in the march   letter app  on may   mccray did an attorney review of mckenzies file and on may   a letter was sent to mckenzie regarding the attorney review app  see  that letter states in part as a client on retainer you are being charged  a month no matter how much work we do for you app  mccray testified this sentence was intended to be a positive communication to the client not a negative tr  lines  in mckenzies application mckenzie had agreed to forward the original correspondence from the credit reporting agencies to bradley ross law app  item  this would have included the responses of the credit reporting agencies to the dispute letters app  ¶  mccray testified that mckenzie did not do this tr  lines  see app  ¶  mccray added now we should have done a better job as far as telling her    making sure shes providing the updated reports and understands and i believe i do a much better job of that now but you know she wasnt a client that long and    when i did my first attorney review that wasnt the issue at that point in time tr  lines  mccray referred to this time as having only involved one round of disputes tr  on june   the second round of dispute letters went out on mckenzies behalf and mckenzie was informed by email app  mckenzie responded by email stating thanks for the update app  on september   a third round of dispute letters went out and mckenzie was again informed by email app  this time there was no response from mckenzie on november   the entry in the client support notes for mckenzie states ineligible with the explanation no credit reports within  months or inbound communication within the last month app  on december   mckenzie called bradley ross law and requested copies of all the dispute letters sent on her behalf she was told that mccray would be informed of her request mckenzie also gave a new address and phone in tucson arizona app  mckenzie testified i kept seeing that my accounts were in dispute or in progress and i never saw anything improve tr  lines  she acknowledged getting the updates from bradley ross law tr  lines  on december   bradley ross law put out a fourth round of dispute letters and informed mckenzie of same by email app  on january   mckenzie called again and stated she wanted a quarterly summary and copies of the dispute letters sent on march   she was informed that mccray would be informed of her request for the dispute letters and that a detailed status report would follow app  on january   mckenzie called bradley ross law and asked to speak to loren mccray or michelle they were not available and mckenzie stated she wished to cancel service app  on january   mckenzie also sent bradley ross law an email which began my email has been down for several weeks and i have been out of town app  on january   bradley ross law sent mckenzie copies of the march   dispute letters and a status of her case app    see app  mckenzie alleged that she called for loren mccray on december   and   and january   and mccray never called her back tr  mccray denied that mckenzie called him in december tr   lines  as seen above the call on january   was for loren mccray or michelle it was in that call that mckenzie cancelled services this action against mccray involves in part the contents of the three letters sent on march   see app  mccray testified that these letters the format of same was purchased from the lexington law firm in utah by bradley ross law tr  the letters are intentionally written as if coming from the client and not a law firm tr  lines  if the letters come directly from the law firm    then the credit reporting agencies take them differently    theyll put in a twodigit code    and it doesnt matter what you say in the letter tr  they redflag it because they regularly get sued by certain attorneys joanne faulkner who brought the    first complaint    against mccray in this action is one of those that regularly sues the three credit reporting agencies   im talking about having hundreds of complaints at any one time against the credit reporting agencies   theyre going to    be very careful about it because they get dinged for damages under the fair credit reporting act and they worry about it tr  as shown above the brochure at that time specifically stated that bradley ross law will sign letters of dispute in your name these letters communicate your dispute in such a way that the credit reporting agencies will most likely accept the dispute and conduct an investigation app  at the hearing mccray testified there have been lots of changes to the application and lots of changes to the brochure for instance i make sure its in big letters that we dispute letters on your behalf and in your name at the very beginning to make sure theres no misunderstanding about that ever again the same thing within the agreement tr  lines  mccray also explained that the letters are formatted in a fashion to prevent negative stalls letters that are ineffective have been weeded out over time    tr  lines  the letters are a method of requesting verification tr   mccray also explained that mckenzie authorized us to dispute anything as inaccurate that she didnt otherwise notify us of and these are just the form letters that we use tr  lines  see application app  item  tr  mckenzie first testified the accounts were accurate i supplied them i provided them directly off of my bankruptcy statement to them i never denied these accounts as being inaccurate thats lying i wouldnt do that tr  but she acknowledged i didnt distinguish either way see tr  lines  further there is the matter of the acknowledged problem with the student loans and mccrays explanation that the problem with the student loans was deeper than mckenzie knew mccray also testified that this process has evolved as described above bradley ross law developed casevalet so clients could go online and specifically indicate items to be disputed and items they did not want disputed tr   in the fall of  they began requiring people to use casevalet tr   in  mccray formatted a new letter that proved successful app  based upon his study of congressional testimony in  tr  mckenzie paid bradley ross law  every month for about ten months tr  mccray testified at the hearing that mckenzie received full value for the money she paid based upon his review of her file and an internal document of bradley ross law created in  to place values on services provided tr  app  see tr  mccray bought out mcmanus effective january   tr  lines   lines   when asked why mccray responded i put a lot of time into it i like the type of work ive been doing this type of thing for bankruptcy clients for a number of years and i think we help people its lucrative i like supervising lots of employees tr  lines  at the time of the hearing mccray testified that he worked  to  hours per week putting equal amounts of time between bradley ross law and loren mccray attorney at law tr  at the time of the hearing bradley ross law had approximately  clients tr  in  the gross receipts of bradley ross law were approximately  million dollars mccray paid himself  and the corporation showed a loss of  tr  a lot of money comes in and a lot of money goes out as expenses tr  lines   bradley ross law was audited by the irs in  and  with the audits coming out fine tr  in september  the employees previously leased from bellwether inc became the employees of mccrays bradley ross law tr  therefore bellwether was no longer involved with employees tr   mccrays intent is to have his employees and everything in north dakota tr  when asked if he sees himself free of bellwether inc and the contracts mccray responded i dont know who else can do the computer stuff to be honest with you tr  lines  at the time of the hearing in this action bradley ross law was sponsoring only one more live snyder seminar after that everything was being moved online with a marketing agreement to be redone in part this new process gives mccray complete control of bradley ross law in regard to seminars and advertising tr    statement of the standard of review in disciplinary board v giese  nd  ¶   nwd  the court stated the standard of review as follows we review disciplinary proceedings de novo on the record in re edwardson  nd  ¶   nwd  in re crary  nd  ¶   nwd  we accord due weight to the hearing panels findings and conclusions but we do not act as a mere rubber stamp of the hearing panels decision edwardson at ¶  in re swanson  nd  ¶   nwd  disciplinary counsel bears the burden of proving each alleged violation of the disciplinary rules by clear and convincing evidence in re disciplinary action against seaworth  nd  ¶   nwd  each disciplinary case must be considered upon its own facts to decide what discipline if any is warranted edwardson at ¶  argument mccray contends the objected to findings conclusions and recommendations of the hearing panel are not supported by clear and convincing evidence and the conclusions of the hearing panel are erroneous and not properly supported by law of fact mccray further contends that disciplinary counsel has failed to meet its burden of proving the alleged violations of the disciplinary rules by clear and convincing evidence mccray requests that the recommendations of the hearing panel be reversed and the matter dismissed mccray will list the objected to findings conclusions and recommendations and provide argument following each i findings paragraph  page  the evidence established that little in the way of meaningful legal work was performed on dr mckenzies behalf due to the volume of files handled by mccray while employed by bradley ross law and the volume of files handled by mccray when employed by bradley ross law pc he did not have time to adequately represent the firms clients including dr mckenzie until recently bradley ross law pc did not check to make sure that some work was done for each client for each month that the client was billed this finding is contrary to the process of the legal work performed for clients by bradley ross law described in the brochure and in the testimony of loren mccray also the brochure and the application clearly stated that bradley ross law could not guarantee results that is also part of the federal croa law tr  this finding also ignores the brochure which urges clients to give the process at least  months here this was not done mccray testified that mckenzie received the full value of the  paid based upon the work done and the value of what had been done a finding by the hearing panel as to other clients of bradley ross law is inappropriate no other client has complained and there exists no factual basis to judge the representation of any other client by bradley ross law mckenzie called bradley ross law at the end of the calendar year  and demanded immediate information although mccray may not have had time at that particular time to immediately respond to mckenzies demands bradley ross law did in fact timely respond to her requests by january   there exists nothing to suggest that bradley ross law could not have responded with personal attention to mckenzie at that time and to also properly proceed with adequate representation of mckenzie towards reaching her goals   note the large type below are the findings of the hearing panel the arguments of the defendant appear under each finding ii conclusions paragraph  a page  dr mckenzie was charged  per month for  months for the law firms services and the services provided did not justify the amount she paid further bradley ross law pc is a credit repair organization and is not operating in accordance with  usc § bb in the manner in which it collected fees from dr mckenzie in response to this conclusion mccray repeats his argument under the findings directly above in regard to the conclusion that bradley ross law is not operating in accordance with  usc § bb the hearing panel has failed to give any reasoning or any legal authority for this conclusion the hearing panel is concluding a violation of federal law without any legal authority to support the conclusion on the contrary mccray relied upon authority in re national credit management group llc  fsuppnd   dnj  in support of his position that he did not violate that statute no federal court has made a finding or conclusion that bradley ross law has violated the federal croa laws nor has disciplinary counsel provided any expert testimony in support of any allegation of a violation of federal law paragraph  b page  the letters written and sent by bradley ross law pc to credit reporting agencies purportedly written by dr mckenzie contained false untrue and misleading statements mccray knew the form letters being used by bradley ross law pc were not written or sent by the firms clients and knew that they contained false untrue and misleading statements mccray contends the letters contained hyperbole for example the statements about the dog and the porch light the statements in the letters that mckenzie did not recognize certain items were not intended to be false untrue or misleading it was intended to obtain verification under the process diligently described by bradley ross law in the brochure and in the testimony of mccray himself clients were informed in the brochure that the letters would be written in the name of the client mccray described in detail the reason why the letters were not written in the name of a law firm importantly too is the fact that there is no evidence that any credit reporting agency considered these form letters to be false untrue or misleading there is no federal court finding or conclusion that bradley ross law or mccray engaged in any false untrue or misleading conduct with the use of these letters paragraph  c page  mccray through bradley ross law pc funded seminars put on by snyder and bellwether inc to solicit clients for bradley ross law pc at the atlanta georgia seminar attended by dr mckenzie on february   for the pecuniary gain of mccray and bradley ross law pc the hearing panel concludes that mccray solicited clients at the atlanta seminar without stating any analysis or reasoning supporting the conclusion of soliciting mckenzie testified that snyder recommended bradley ross law but this is contrary to the testimony of mccray and how he instructed these seminars to be run snyder could not recommend bradley ross law but could indicate that bradley ross law was a sponsor and was in attendance if people wished to see what the firm had available the process was set up so as not to overbear mckenzies will mckenzie had to go down a hall and into another room she was given a copy of the completed form with every opportunity to cancel the agreement before any money came out of her account this process does not constitute solicitation paragraph  d pages  the letters written by mccrays law firm were dishonest and contained misrepresentations further the conduct of mccray in the operation of bradley ross law pc including the method in which dr mckenzie was solicited as a client and the process of sending dispute letters being written on dr mckenzies behalf that were dishonest and contained misrepresentations constitutes conduct which is prejudicial to the administration of justice mccray repeats his argument under  b and  c above mccray denies that the operation of bradley ross law constitutes conduct which is prejudicial to the administration of justice mccray described his experience with bankruptcy law both before and during his relationship with bradley ross law he testified how he helped bankruptcy clients with these same issues before he became involved with bradley ross law he described how bradley ross law is a value and benefit to the clients he serves with all of these clients of bradley ross law only one client and one rival attorney have complained about mccrays conduct the very existence of croa laws gives credence to credit repair organizations and the lawyers who work in this area again no federal court has made any finding or conclusion that mccray or bradley ross law has operated in violation of those federal laws paragraph  e page  mccray brought reproach upon the legal profession by inappropriately soliciting dr mckenzie as a client inappropriately requiring dr mckenzie to proclaim by contract that she had sought out the services of bradley ross law pc in north dakota inappropriately charging an unreasonable fee and inappropriately mailing letters to credit agencies purportedly sent by dr mckenzie which contained false information and misrepresentations mccray denies that he has brought reproach upon the legal profession mccray repeats his arguments under  d directly above the hearing panel has given no legal authority to support the conclusions that mccray inappropriately required mckenzie to proclaim by contract that she had sought out the services of bradley ross law pc in north dakota or that mccray inappropriately charged an unreasonable fee paragraph  a pages  mccray could not adequately represent  to  clients by himself nor could he adequately supervise  to  leased employees of the firm located in fishers indiana mccray was assisting some or all of the  to  leased employees of bradley ross law pc in the unauthorized practice of law there was no evidence that other clients of bradley ross law were not adequately represented no evidence is cited in support of the conclusion that mccray failed to adequately supervise his employees in fishers indiana mccray testified that he traveled to fishers indiana on a number of occasions and he was always electronically linked with the staff and the files no evidence is cited where an employee practiced law the case analysts and the data analysts were working under the process and procedures set up by the lawyers of bradley ross law there is no evidence to the contrary this is a broad bold conclusion without any cited facts or evidence in support paragraph  b page  mccray through bradley ross law pc violated this provision by collecting between  and  per month from  to  clients regardless of how much work was done for a client regardless if any work was done for a client and with little or not involvement by mccray further this method of billing does not meet the requirements of  usc bb regardless of how much work was done was testified to by mccray to be a positive statement for the client and not a negative statement there was absolutely no evidence how any other client of bradley ross law was impacted by the fee structure of  per month the evidence simply does not exist and the hearing panel is pulling this conclusion out of thin air again the hearing panel is finding a violation of federal law without any cited authority and without any analysis of facts again no federal court has made a finding or conclusion that mccray has violated federal law paragraph  page  the hearing panel considered the following aggravating factors under rule  of the standards for imposing lawyer sanctions a pattern of misconduct multiple offenses refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct and substantial experience in the practice of law there is no pattern of misconduct in this case on the contrary only one person out of many has complained also the record is filled with instances of mccray continually improving the workings of bradley ross law there is no evidence of multiple offenses it is mccrays substantial experience in bankruptcy which allows him to competently work under bradley ross law mccrays testimony reflects how he has thoughtfully and professionally evolved bradley ross law iii recommendations page  the hearing panel recommends that mccray be suspended from the practice of law for  days and that he be required to pay the costs and expenses of these proceedings in the amount of  in accordance with the affidavit of paul w jacobson dated october   mccray objects to the recommendations of the hearing panel and requests the court to find that allegations of the violations against him have not been proven by clear and convincing evidence mccray requests the court to dismiss these actions against him conclusion wherefore mccray requests the supreme court of north dakota to reverse the decision of the hearing panel and dismiss this case respectfully

contact practice coordinator   ext  surgery scheduler   ext  fax   additional information workers comp no qme no dr stephen snyder began practice with the southern california orthopedic institute scoi in  as one of the five founding partners he became interested in shoulder arthroscopy in  since shoulder arthroscopy was a unfamiliar surgical procedure at the time there was very little information available to guide an interested surgeon wishing to learn this new surgical discipline  to enable the performance of arthroscopic repairs of ruptured rotator cuff and biceps tendons as well as the reattachment of torn ligaments dr snyder partnered with several newly formed surgical equipment companies to develop a complete catalogue of novel miniature tools including suture anchors stitching tools tissue handling devices arm support brackets cannulas as well as a full line of shoulder braces and splints a few of the  surgical products dr snyder has invented and codeveloped these “inventions” along with many others are in use today many in the second and third iterations and have catalyzed the development for numerous additional tools and techniques that have enhanced surgical outcomes   with these newly created tools available it now was possible to conceive practice and perfect new surgical procedures  not only was dr snyder instrumental in innovating the techniques for the now standard operations such as rotator cuff repairs shoulder instability corrections and calcium and bone spur removal but when he found it necessary to devise a method to replace the massive nonrepairable rotator cuff tendon the eventual solution was the graftjacket allograft soft tissue patch  with this operation performed arthroscopically in the outpatient surgery a tissue patch is sutured to the edges of the torn rotator cuff defect to close it and allow the body to actually regenerate a new cuff tendon this is an example of a patient who had a massive tear of the rotator cuff tendon that has regenerated after placing a graftjacket patch to fill in for the missing tendon early in his career dr snyder recognized the need to have better methods to train surgeons in the complex skills needed to perform shoulder arthroscopy he determined that it would be useful to develop a realistic shoulder model with which students could practice and perfect the new techniques without potentially injuring the patients or the need for cadavers  the product was completed in  and was dubbed “alex the shoulder professor” a realistic lifesized surgical model that is now used for surgeon training worldwide  to enhance the product and make it available to every surgeon a kit including an arthroscope a light source a coupler and an internet video camera was developed thus enabling the use of a laptop computer in place of an expensive surgical setup to further exchange new information with other surgeons around the world dr snyder conceived and founded the shoulder arthroscopy study group an association composed of shoulder arthroscopic surgeons from around the world  the focus of the association was to share arthroscopic surgical cases on videotapes dvds and later internet and thus facilitate learning new techniques  with dr snyder’s help and many other shoulder arthroscopy pioneers this nascent society has bloomed into a successful internet web site called vumedicom and is the leading source for shoulder arthroscopy teaching videos available   dr snyder joined the arthroscopy association of north america in  and was chosen to be the first to coordinator of the shoulder arthroscopy section he later served as the chairman of the education committee and the treasurer of the board of directors he is an active member of the american shoulder and elbow surgeons association the th century orthopaedic organization the western orthopedic association the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons and the arthroscopy association of north america dr snyder is passionate about teaching and has traveled throughout the world as an invited lecturer to help others learn the art of shoulder arthroscopy  he founded the scoi clasroom center for learning arthroscopic skills designed as a hightech learning center for shoulder arthroscopy techniques using the alex models and the latest “virtual reality” simulators the clasroom is located in the scoi van nuys office and is frequented by student doctors from around the world without charge to facilitate their surgical training in addition he is a senior member of the teaching faculty of the scoi sports medicine fellowship clasroom® center for learning arthroscopic skills dr snyder’s most notable contribution to shoulder arthroscopy education has been his sole authorship of the first two additions his textbooks “scoi shoulder arthroscopy” the third edition which is being coauthored by five of the scoi shoulder partners is being published in  stephen j snyder md is available to see patients in the van nuys office three editions of scoi shoulder arthroscopy textbook outside of the office dr snyder enjoys flyfishing biking exercising traveling video editing hiking reading and his
