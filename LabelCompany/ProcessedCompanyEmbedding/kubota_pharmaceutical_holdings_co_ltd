portfolio of drugs and devices to preserve and restore vision for millions worldwide we have a broad product candidate portfolio of multiple technologies in the preclinical and clinical development stages intended to provide solutions to ophthalmic disorders affecting millions of people worldwide we are pursuing development of our product candidates for debilitating diseases such as diabetic retinopathydiabetic macular edema cataract retinitis pigmentosa stargardt disease and agerelated macular degeneration as part of our mobile health application initiatives we are also developing technologies intended to detect nascent disease progression to improve treatment outcome in patients with wet agerelated macular degeneration diabetic macular edema and other neovascular retinal diseases our lead compound for stargardt disease is emixustat it is administrated as a oncedaily oral tablet and belongs to a novel class of drug candidates called visual cycle modulators or vcm based on preclinical data emixustat is being evaluated clinically to potentially reduce toxins implicated in the pathogenesis of stargardt disease and preserve the integrity of retinal tissue thereby slowing disease progression the us fda granted orphan drug designation to emixustat for the treatment of stargardt disease in january  the compound may also have application in other retinal diseases including diabetic retinopathy a multicenter phase b clinical trial evaluating emixustat for geographic atrophy or ga has been recently completed and emixustat failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit in ga patients as a consequence we announced in june  that our codevelopment partner for emixustat otsuka pharmaceutical co ltd or otsuka had terminated the emixustat collaboration agreement our lead technology for neovascular retinal diseases such as wet age related macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy  diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion is acu acu is a small molecule found in animal studies to suppress vascular endothelial growth factor or vegf driven vascular leakage and neovascularization while promoting homeostasis of healthy tissue in december  we entered into an rd collaboration agreement or the collaboration agreement with eyemedics llc or eyemedics pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement we and eyemedics will jointly conduct through human proof of concept the preclinical and clinical development of acu our lead compound for the treatment of cataract is lanosterol lanosterol has been found in animal studies to reverse lens opacification the medical condition that defines cataracts lanosterol may reverse lens opacification in humans while maintaining the natural lens ability to accommodate a process required to allow for reading and other activities that rely on near vision we licensed the global rights excluding hong kong taiwan and china for lanosterol from youhealth eyetech inc or youhealth in march  we may also consider clinical development of lanosterol for presbyopia our lead technology for retinitis pigmentosa or rp is an optogenetic therapy designed to make bipolar cells in the retina light sensitive it is anticipated that this may restore some vision in advanced rp patients left with very limited visual function prior to therapy we licensed the technology from the university of manchester in april  in addition to a diverse portfolio of drug candidates for various ophthalmic indications we have invested in mobile health application initiatives the patient based ophthalmology suite or pbos is being designed to detect nascent disease progression to improve treatment outcome in patients with wet agerelated macular degeneration or amd diabetic macular edema or dme and other neovascular retinal diseases our longterm strategy is to commercialize drugs and devices that will benefit people living with debilitating ophthalmological conditions we intend to leverage our internal research and development efforts to develop an innovative portfolio of ophthalmology products as part of our strategic plan we are pursuing external partnerships and inlicensing and ma opportunities description of operating accounts revenue from collaborations to date has been generated primarily by our research and development activities pursuant to our collaboration and licensing agreements with otsuka our revenue consists of reimbursement from otsuka for our fees paid to external service providers in connection with our collaboration agreements with otsuka payment from otsuka for the development services provided by our personnel for services rendered as part of our collaborative research program otsukas funding of our portion of development costs under the emixustat agreement an initial license fee as part of the emixustat agreement and milestone payments we began winding down our collaborations efforts with otsuka following their notice to  table of contents terminate their collaboration and licensing agreements with us in june  we did not recognize any revenue for the three month period ended march   and do not anticipate recognizing any further revenues from otsuka in the absence of any new collaboration agreements we do not expect revenue in  we are required by the tokyo stock exchange to generate revenue five years after our ipo in  currently we are pursuing various partnering efforts and if such partnering transactions are consummated expect to generate revenue in the future through such strategic collaborations research and development expenses incurred to date have substantially focused on developing potential therapies for sightthreatening diseases following entry into our collaboration agreements with otsuka and prior to the termination of such agreements our efforts had been principally directed towards fulfilling our commitments thereunder particularly under the emixustat agreement we recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred and these costs primarily consist of fees paid to consultants contract research organizations independent monitors of our clinical trials and parties acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials including all related fees such as investigator fees license fees patient screening lab work and data compilation and statistical analysis costs related to production of clinical materials including fees paid to contract manufacturers costs related to compliance with the us food and drug administration and european medicine agency regulatory requirements consulting fees paid to third parties involved in research and development activities compensation and related expenses for personnel in research and development functions and an allocated portion of certain general and administrative costs we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we pursue development of our product candidates in multiple indications and execute inlicensing transactions resulting in potential upfront and milestone payments general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions including finance accounting legal and human resources other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments other income expense consists primarily of foreign exchange gainslosses incurred on transactions occurring in japan gain or losses from the disposal of fixed assets or other miscellaneous items income tax expense consists of insignificant deferred income taxes in  and  in addition to the recording of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for which we do not anticipate future realization we did not record an income tax benefit for the periods ended march   or  as the result of a full valuation allowance  table of contents results of operations comparison of three month periods ended march   and march   revenue from collaborations the following table presents revenues for clinical programs in thousands except percentages three months ended march   to   to     change  change emixustat          total          the decrease in revenue from collaborations for the three months ended march   compared to the same period in  was due to the completion of the emixustat clinical trial during  and winddown activities related to emixustat following the termination of our collaboration with otsuka winddown activities related to emixustat were completed in december  our phase b clinical trial results related to emixustat for the treatment of geographic atrophy was completed in may  we do not expect to generate any revenue from the terminated collaboration with otsuka related to emixustat in the future operating expenses research and development we anticipate that potential product candidates developed under our strategic plan may be developed independently and in the absence of establishing new collaborations our expenditures on such programs will not be funded by collaborative partners as a consequence we expect our total research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we pursue development of our product candidates in multiple indications and potentially execute additional inlicensing transactions resulting in potential upfront and milestone payments by program our research and development expenses were as follows in thousands except percentages three months ended march   to   to     change  change internal research          emixustat       total          research and development expense decreased  million for the three months ended march   or  as compared to the same period in  research and development expenses incurred through our internal research activities decreased for the three months ended march   compared to same period in  mainly due to a  upfront nonrefundable fee of  million paid to youhealth in connection with the option and license agreement for lanosterol technology in  internal research expenses excluding the youhealth payment increased due to new product development in connection with execution of our strategic plan research and development expense related to clinical programs under the emixustat agreement decreased for the three months ended march   compared to same period in  mainly due to the completion of the phase b clinical trial and related winddown in activities related to such clinical trial following the termination of the emixustat agreement in  in  we incurred  million in research and development expense related to the emixustat clinical programs for stargardt disease and proliferative diabetic retinopathy  table of contents general and administrative three months ended march   to   to     change  change general and administrative          general and administrative expenses decreased  million for the three months ended march   compared to same period in  primarily due to the following  we recognized less stock based compensation expense primarily due to market based awards which fully vested in the prior year in the amount of  million  we paid  million less in corporate legal expenses and charges related to the redomicile transaction  we incurred fewer charges in labor taxes and other benefits of  million due to having fewer employees in  and  other expenses decreased by  million

million and  million respectively amounts on deposit with thirdparty financial institutions may exceed the applicable federal deposit insurance corporation and the securities investor protection corporation insurance limits as applicable we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operating activities working capital capital expenditures and other capital requirements for at least the next  months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the expansion of our research and development activities and our ability to successfully inlicense or acquire additional technologies other than our exclusive option to purchase the assets related to our collaboration agreement with eyemedics
