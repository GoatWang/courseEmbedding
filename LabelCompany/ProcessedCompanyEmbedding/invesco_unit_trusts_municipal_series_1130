purpose of issue and location of issuer and e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be

public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds we seek to diversify your portfolio by type of bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds a percentages they represent in your portfolio as listed under summary of essential financial information these bonds are described in greater detail in the information supplement see additional information general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value municipal bond risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the economic recession in the united states which began in  technically came to an end in june of  however the us and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity the us and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted in december of  the us federal reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program however there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years on august   standard  poors rating services downgraded the longterm sovereign credit rating of the united states of america to aa from aaa citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your trusts holdings market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes given the historically low interest rate environment in the us risks associated with rising rates are heightened the negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early the first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is listed in prospectus part i along with the price the issuer would have to pay some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section in prospectus part i and the notes thereto additional discussion of call provisions appears in the information supplement bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described under the bonds reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent the market for certain investments may become less liquid or illiquid due to adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or due to adverse market or economic conditions in the absence of a liquid trading market for a particular security the price at which such security may be sold to meet redemptions as well as the value of the units of your trust may be adversely affected no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income andor principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust for example future legislation could reduce tax rates impose a flat tax exempt all investment income from tax or change the tax status of the bonds litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns  the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return are set forth in the prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trust and with the principal prepayment default if any redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life in years eltr life of a trusts portfolio eltr life years sales charge  less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     and over   the eltr life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a trusts portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating estimated longterm return see estimated current and longterm returns the sales charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market public offering price per unit for example the maximum secondary market sales charge for a trust with an eltr life of  but less than  years would be  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds reducing your sales charge employees officers and directors including their spouses or the equivalent if recognized under local law and children or stepchildren under  living in the same household parents or stepparents and trustees custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons of invesco capital markets inc and its affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may purchase units at the public offering price less the applicable dealer concession all employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm only employees officers and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts unit price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for regular trading or earlier on days where the bond market association recommends an early bond market close orders received by the trustee or sponsor for purchases sales or redemptions after that time or on a day when the new york stock exchange is closed will be held until the next determination of price the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to range approximately from  to  more than the bid price the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the fund b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid by the bonds semiannually although each trust accrues interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to purchases of units in the secondary market the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units you will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your units on the next distribution date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unitholders if you sell or redeem all or a portion of your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of your units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest the sponsor intends to qualify units for sale in a number of states brokerdealers or others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the distribution of units equal to  of the sales charge applicable to the transaction provided that the units are acquired from the sponsor certain commercial banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis a portion of the sales charge paid by these customers equal to the agency commission referred to above is retained by or remitted to the banks any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or agent the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units and to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge sponsor compensation the sponsor will receive a gross sales commission equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved see public offeringgeneral in addition the sponsor realized a profit or loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a trust the sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from which the bonds in the trusts were acquired the sponsor may further realize profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of units excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed if any will be retained by the sponsor the sponsor will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which units are purchased and the price at which units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased units at a price above or below the purchase price brokerdealers of the trusts banks andor others are eligible to participate in a program in which such firms receive from the sponsor a nominal award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units of unit investment trusts created by the sponsor during a specified time period in addition at various times the sponsor may implement other programs under which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the sponsor or participate in sales programs sponsored by the sponsor an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs also the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of the trusts such payments are made by the sponsor out of its own assets and not out of the assets of the trusts these programs will not change the price unitholders pay for their units or the amount that the trusts will receive from the units sold market for units although not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for units and offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash on hand less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the trust and less any accrued trust expenses if the supply of units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it the sponsor may either discontinue all purchases of units or discontinue purchases of units at these prices if a market is not maintained and the unitholder cannot find another purchaser a unitholder will be able to dispose of units by tendering them to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price see rights of unitholdersredemption of units a unitholder who wishes to dispose of his units should inquire of his broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof the trustee will notify the sponsor of any tender of units for redemption if the sponsors bid in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the redemption price per unit it may purchase the units not later than the day on which the units would otherwise have been redeemed by the trustee rights of unitholders  distributions of interest and principal unitholders who purchase units in the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the election if any of the prior owner interest received by a trust pro rated on an annual basis will be distributed monthly unless the prior owner of your units elected to receive quarterly or semiannual distributions certain trusts offer only monthly distribution options while others offer only monthly and semiannual distribution options a trust that has elected to be structured as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes may make additional distributions at the end of each year interest received by a trust including that part of the proceeds of any disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest is credited by the trustee to the interest account other receipts are credited to the principal account interest received will be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date all distributions will be net of estimated expenses the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds

year to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date if the amount available for distribution shall equal at least  per unit because interest payments are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year interest distributions may be more or less than the amount credited to the interest account as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions the trustee is authorized to advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds

trustee has not received the unitholders tax identification number as required by such regulations any amount withheld is transmitted to the irs and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing a return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker however at any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption the

offeringoffering price accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the interest account or if the balance therein is insufficient from the principal account all other amounts will be withdrawn from the principal account units so redeemed shall be cancelled the price at which units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid by the unitholder and may be less than the par

units of a trust that has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes please see notes to financial statements in prospectus part i tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer a taxexempt entity or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences of an investment in a trust this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of counsel to the sponsor the irs could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust the trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its compliance and reporting obligations as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the trust the trust will hold various debt obligations the bonds of state and local governmental entities that constitute debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes as described below it is possible that the trust will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the trust constitute the trust assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the trust assets trust status if the trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the trust assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg interest accruals of original issue discount and market discount and capital gains if any from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from trust assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses exclusion from gross income of interest at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities based on certain representations and subject to compliance with certain covenants neither the sponsor nor its counsel have made any special review for the trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds the bases for the bond counsel opinions or compliance with the covenants required for taxexemption the irs has an ongoing program of auditing taxexempt obligations to determine whether in the view of the irs interest on such taxexempt obligations is includible in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes it cannot be predicted whether or not the irs will commence an audit of any of the bonds if an audit is commenced under current procedures of the irs unitholders may have no right to participate in such procedure if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received both prior to and after the date on which interest is determined to be taxable your pro rata share of interest on the bonds will be excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent that such interest would be excluded from your gross income if you directly owned the bonds however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax and the branch profits tax imposed on certain foreign corporations ownership of the units may result in collateral federal income tax consequences to certain unit holders including without limitation corporations subject to the branch profits tax financial institutions certain insurance companies certain s corporations individual recipients of social security or railroad retirement benefits and unit holders who may be deemed to have incurred or continued indebtedness to purchase or carry taxexempt obligations if you are a substantial user of the facilities financed with the proceeds of certain bonds or a related person to a substantial user you will not be able to exclude from your gross income interest with respect to these bonds substantial user and related person are defined under federal income tax law for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations interest on certain bonds is included as an item of tax preference in the case of certain corporations the alternative minimum tax depends upon the corporations alternative minimum taxable income amti which is the corporations taxable income with certain adjustments one of the adjustment items used in computing amti of a corporation excluding s corporations regulated investment companies real estate investment trusts remics or fasits is an amount equal to  of the excess of such corporations adjusted current earnings over an amount equal to its amti before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction adjusted current earnings includes all taxexempt interest including interest on all of the bonds in the trust however legislation added in  provides that interest on taxexempt bonds issued in  and  is not included in the corporate adjustment based on current earnings in addition a branch profits tax is levied on the effectively connected earnings and profits of certain foreign corporations which include taxexempt interest such as interest on the bonds in the trust your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the trust assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of accruals of original issue discount market discount premium and accrued interest as discussed below dividends and net capital gains also are subject to a  federal tax on net investment income for taxpayers at higher income levels net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income discount accrued interest and premium on bonds some bonds may have been issued with original issue discount this generally means that the bonds were originally issued at a price below their face or par value original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes thus the accrual of original discount will be excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent as interest on the bonds as discussed above your basis of each bond that was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original issue discount accrues some bonds may have been purchased by you or your trust at a market discount market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity for the bond over the purchase price of the bond market discount can arise based on the price your trust pays for a bond or based on the price you pay for your units market discount is taxed as ordinary income you will recognize this income when your trust receives principal payments on the bond when the bond is disposed of or redeemed or when you sell or redeem your units alternatively you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions alternatively some bonds may have been purchased by you or your trust at a premium generally if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any bond generally including sales charges exceeds the amount payable at maturity such excess is considered premium you must amortize bond premium on a constant yield basis over the remaining term of the bond in a manner that takes into account potential call dates and call prices you cannot deduct amortized bond premium relating to a bond the amortized bond premium is treated as a reduction in the taxexempt interest received as bond premium is amortized it reduces your basis in the bond the tax basis reduction requirement may result in your realizing a taxable gain when your units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than your cost if the price of your units includes accrued interest on a bond you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that bond when your trust receives this accrued interest you must treat it as a return of capital and reduce your tax basis in the bond this discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax treatment of original issue discount market discount and premium the rules however are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances for example the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the discussion set forth above in the case of bonds that were issued with original issue discount exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future invescosponsored unit investment trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and in general any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trusts for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical trust assets under the wash sale provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code in kind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may request an in kind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units by electing to receive an in kind distribution you will receive trust assets plus possibly cash you will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole trust assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same trust assets held by your trust however if you also receive cash in exchange for a trust asset or a fractional portion of a trust asset you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such trust asset or fractional portion limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income your ability to deduct trust expenses is also limited to the extent the expenses are allocable to taxexempt interest from the trust the foreign account tax compliance act fatca a  withholding tax on your trusts distributions including capital gains distributions and on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of units generally applies if paid to a foreign entity unless i if the foreign entity is a foreign financial institution as defined under fatca the foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence reporting withholding and certification obligations ii if the foreign entity is not a foreign financial institution it identifies certain of its us investors or iii the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under fatca if required under the rules above and subject to the applicability of any intergovernmental agreements between the united states and the relevant foreign country withholding under fatca applies i with respect to distributions from your trust and ii with respect to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of units that occur on or after january   if withholding is required under fatca on a payment related to your units investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding on such payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the irs to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction your trust will not pay any additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under fatca you should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of fatca based on your individual circumstances regulated investment companies this section summarizes some of the principal us federal income tax consequences of owning units of a trust that intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws please see notes to financial statements in prospectus part i tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of

your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status certain trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as regulated investment companies under the federal tax laws if a trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law such trust generally will not pay federal income taxes in addition such trusts intend to hold a sufficient amount of their assets in bonds that are exempt from us federal income taxation so as to qualify to distribute exemptinterest dividends to unitholders such exemptinterest dividends are not subject to regular us federal income tax but may be subject to the alternative minimum tax the trusts may hold bonds issued by the government of puerto rico or under its authority such bonds are exempt from taxation by the us federal government the government of puerto rico any state or its political subdivisions any possession of the united states or the district of columbia distributions after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that specifies your amounts of exemptinterest dividends ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends exemptinterest dividends generally are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes some or all of the exemptinterest dividends however may be taken into account in determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences eg they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are taxed ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your federal tax rate for ordinary income generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year dividends received deduction and qualified dividend income a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from a trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies that do not invest in stock an individual that owns units generally will not be entitled to treat dividends received from a trust as qualified dividend income currently taxed at longterm capital gains rates because it is not expected that such dividends will be attributable to qualified dividend income received by such trust sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units further if you hold your units for six months or less any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such a unit will be disallowed to the extent of the exemptinterest dividends you received if any capital gains and losses net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be disallowed to the extent of the exemptinterest dividends you received to the extent if any it is not disallowed it will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations there is no requirement that tax consequences be taken into account in administering your portfolio exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future invescosponsored unit investment trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes in kind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an in kind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses under the tax rules deductibility of trust expenses generally expenses incurred by your trust will be deducted from the gross income received by your trust and only your share of the trusts net taxable income if any will be paid to you and reported as taxable income to you however if the units of your trust are held by fewer than  unitholders at any time during a taxable year your trust will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income thus resulting in your reported share of your trusts taxable income being increased by your share of those expenses even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution in this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income further because the trusts pay exemptinterest dividends which are treated as exempt interest for federal income tax purposes you will not be able to deduct some of your interest expense for debt that you incur or continue to purchase or carry

the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes neither the sponsor nor its counsel nor california counsel has independently examined the bonds to be deposited in

sale or otherwise or when the california unitholder redeems or sells units of the trust to the extent that such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such california unitholder for federal income tax purposes however there are certain differences between the recognition of gain or loss for federal income tax purposes and for california personal income tax purposes and california unitholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in a california unitholder

the case of bonds issued before march   issued with original issue discount owned by the trust in which case gain or loss for georgia income tax purposes may differ from the amount recognized for federal income tax purposes because original issue discount on such bonds may be determined by accruing said original issue discount on a ratable basis due to the amortization of bond premium and other basis adjustments required by the code a unitholder under some circumstances may realize taxable gain when his or her units are sold or redeemed for an amount less than or equal to their original cost  amounts paid under an insurance policy or policies issued to the trust if any with respect to the bonds in the trust which represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by

bonds the types of bonds included in each trust are described under portfolio in the related prospectus part i neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds general obligation bonds and revenue bonds certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest however the taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited by provisions of state constitutions or laws and an entitys credit will depend on many factors some such factors are the entitys tax base the extent to which the entity relies on federal or state aid and other factors which are beyond the entitys control revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors housing bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured multifamily housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to housing projects for low to moderate income families single family mortgage revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income the ability of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be affected by various economic and noneconomic factors such factors include occupancy levels adequate rental income in multifamily projects the rate of default on mortgage loans underlying single family issuers and the ability of mortgage insurers to pay claims mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in connection with the housing bonds held by a trust the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates health care bonds certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs it also may be necessary for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its facilities equipment personnel and services hospitals and other health care facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that a claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that insurance coverage will be available to a facility public utility and wholesale electric bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds water and sewer bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances industrial revenue bonds certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected lease obligation bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity hereinafter called lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain nonappropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefore a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby although nonappropriation lease obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult higher educations and public education bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other funds the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers airport and transportation bonds certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints acts of terrorism and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents waste disposal bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds original issue discount bonds certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount bonds will be reduced a bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates see federal tax status in prospectus part ii market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest redemption or sale prior to maturity certain of the bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise a sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement of debt a callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new debt obligation in general call provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the current return on units of the trust involved each trust portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call provisions if any with respect to each of the debt obligations extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of certain events generally events that may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include among others a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used an exercise by a local state or federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities such as taxes not imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds an administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds the issuer of certain bonds in a trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell upon the satisfaction of certain conditions to third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such bonds in such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party a third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights the sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds see also the discussion of single family mortgage and multifamily revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon any of the trusts at any time after the date of deposit litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted each trust has received or will receive opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds insurance on the bonds insurance has been obtained by the issuers of certain bonds in the trusts prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of such bonds see the trustsobjective and bond

have laws and regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of dividends transactions with affiliates mergers consolidations acquisitions or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings in order to be in an insured trust bonds must be insured by one of the preinsured bond insurers in determining eligibility for insurance the preinsured bond insurers have applied their own standards which correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the selection of bonds by the sponsor to the extent the standards of the preinsured bond insurers are more restrictive than those of the sponsor the previously stated trust investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds this decision is made prior to the date of deposit as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an insured trust thus all of the bonds in the portfolios of the insured trusts are insured by the issuer of the bonds prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust preinsured bonds in an insured trust may or may not have a higher yield than comparably uninsured bonds in selecting such bonds for an insured trust the sponsor has applied the criteria described under the trustsobjectives and bond selection in the event of nonpayment of interest or principal when due in respect of a bond a preinsured bond insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened but not earlier than the date such payment is due the preinsured bond insurer as regards any payment it may make will succeed to the rights of the trustee in respect thereof all policies issued by the preinsured bond insurers if any are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an insured trust are concerned the internal revenue service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal obligations paid to holders of insured bonds under policy provisions substantially identical to the policies described herein will be excludable from federal gross income under section a of the internal revenue code to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal obligations holders of units in an insured trust should discuss with their tax advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling however counsel for the sponsor at the time of the closing of the insured trust had given an opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from federal gross income to the extent described under federal tax status in prospectus part ii the information relating to each preinsured bond insurer if any has been furnished by such companies the financial information with respect to each preinsured bond insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities no representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof portfolio administration the trustee is empowered to sell for the purpose of redeeming units tendered by any unitholder and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be available such of the bonds designated by the supervisor as the trustee in its sole discretion may deem necessary the supervisor in designating such bonds will consider a variety of factors including a interest rates b market value and c marketability the sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of bonds if the supervisor determines there exists any default in payment of principal or interest institution of certain legal proceedings default under other documents adversely affecting debt service default in payment of principal or interest or other obligations of the same issuer decline in projected income pledged for debt service on revenue bonds or decline in price or the occurrence of other market or credit factors including advance refunding ie the issuance of refunding securities and the deposit of the proceeds thereof in trust or escrow to retire the refunded securities on their respective redemption dates so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention of such bonds would be detrimental to the interest of the unitholders in connection with the insured trusts to the extent that bonds are sold which are current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds the overall quality of the bonds remaining in such trusts portfolio will tend to diminish the sponsor is empowered but not obligated to direct the trustee to dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding the sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan except that the sponsor may instruct the trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other action with respect thereto as the sponsor may deem proper if  the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or  in the written opinion of the sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the reasonably foreseeable future any obligation so received in exchange or substitution will be held by the trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the trust agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder within five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying bonds the trustee is required to give notice thereof to each unitholder of the trust thereby affected identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefore except as stated herein and under fund administrationreplacement bonds in prospectus part ii regarding the substitution of replacement bonds for failed bonds the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the bonds initially deposited is not permitted if any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bonds occurs and no provision for payment is made therefore within  days the trustee is required to notify the sponsor thereof if the sponsor fails to instruct the trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within  days after notification by the trustee to the sponsor of such default the trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred sponsor information invesco capital markets inc is the sponsor of the trust the sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of invesco advisers inc invesco advisers invesco advisers is

bonds in the trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time for this reason among others the amount realized by a

of the balance of the interest and principal accounts with such distribution the unitholder shall be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount distributable at such time as the trustee in its sole discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary it shall make distribution thereof to unitholders in the same manner notwithstanding the foregoing in connection with final distributions to unitholders of an insured trust it should be noted that because the portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust if any is applicable only while bonds so insured are held by such trust the price to be received by such trust upon the disposition of any such bond which is in default by reason of nonpayment of principal or interest will not reflect any value based on such insurance therefore in connection with any liquidation it shall not be necessary for the trustee to and the trustee does not currently intend to dispose of any bond or bonds if retention of such bond or bonds until due shall be deemed to be in the best interest of unitholders including but not limited to situations in which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from a significant risk of default since the preinsured bonds will reflect the value of the related insurance it is the present intention of the sponsor not to direct the trustee to hold any of such preinsured bonds after the date of termination all proceeds received less applicable expenses from insurance on defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be distributed to unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the trustee description of ratings standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies a standard  poors municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond this assessment of creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price the ratings are based on current information furnished to standard  poors by the issuer and obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the bond in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaathis is the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aaan obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong aan obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbban obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to bbb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings a provisional rating p assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion the investor should exercise his own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk moodys investors service inc a brief description of the applicable moodys rating symbols and their meanings follows aaabonds which are rated aaa are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payment and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well note moodys applies numerical modifiers   and  in each generic rating classification from aa through b in its corporate bond rating system the modifier  indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category state trust risk factors california risk factors general economic conditions economic outlook the economy of the state is the largest among the  states and one of the largest and most diverse in the world the diversified economy of the state has major components in high technology trade entertainment agriculture manufacturing government tourism construction and financial services certain of the states significant industries such as high technology are sensitive to economic disruptions in their export markets the states economy is in the midst of a gradual recovery from the most severe economic downturn and financial pressure since the s continued growth in the hightechnology sector international trade and tourism along with improvements in residential construction and real estate markets have been positive indicators of californias broadening economic recovery while persistent unemployment impedes greater economic growth and revenue generation analysts generally expect the states economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace in the near future the legislative analysts office lao a nonpartisan fiscal and policy adviser has projected that the states economic recovery should continue its steady progress and that the state will continue its progress in building budget reserves under the recently approved proposition  however continued uncertainty about the effects of federal policy and weak global growth create fiscal risks and pressures to a more robust recovery there can be no assurance that the positive economic and fiscal trends will continue or that the economy will not become more difficult as of april  californias unemployment was  compared to  at the recessions peak in october  and the prerecession low of  in november  job growth in the state increased by  during the twelvemonth period ending april  due to slow but consistent job growth since february  california has gained approximately  jobs through april  gaining an average of  jobs per month over the course of the month expansion geography californias geographic location subjects it to earthquake and wildfire risks it is impossible to predict the time magnitude or location of a major earthquake or wildfire or its effect on the california economy in august  a major earthquake struck the napa valley area causing significant damage in a three county area in october  a series of wildfires burned across southern california forcing approximately  million evacuations and causing significant damage in seven counties the possibility exists that other such earthquakes or wildfires could create major dislocation of the california economy and could significantly affect state and local governmental budgets states of emergency on may   the governor declared a state of emergency for santa barbara county due to the effects of an oil spill the spill was the result of a pipeline rupture that caused the release of more than  gallons of oil and other potentially hazardous substances into the pacific ocean near refugio state beach in his proclamation of a state of emergency the governor acknowledged that local governments and businesses along the santa barbara county coast will suffer longterm impacts from the spill the actual impact of the spill on the states economy is impossible to estimate however the overall cost of the cleanup longterm environmental damage and resulting loss of revenue could be substantial state budgets budget process california has a fiscal year ending on june  of each year under the state constitution the governor must submit a proposed budget to the legislature by january  of the preceding fiscal year and the legislature must adopt a final budget by june  of the preceding fiscal year both the proposed budget and final budget are required to be balanced in that general fund expenditures must not exceed projected general fund revenues and transfers for the fiscal year california receives revenues from taxes fees and other sources the most significant of which are personal income tax sales and use tax and corporate tax which collectively constitute more than  of general fund revenues and transfers during the economic downturn historic revenue shortfalls resulted in multibillion dollar budget deficits for consecutive fiscal years and severe cash shortages in california during the  and  fiscal years the state budget addressed approximately  billion in annual deficits through a combination of significant spending cuts temporary tax increases borrowing and other budgetary measures while the state has continued to face fiscal pressure from deferred budgetary obligations accumulated over the prior decade primarily to schools and local governments the socalled wall of debt and unfunded liabilities associated with the state employee retirement systems and state retiree health benefits the state projects that the budget will be balanced in an ongoing manner until at least fiscal year  however unanticipated or rising costs revenue shortfalls or the states inability to enact or effectively realize budget solutions may adversely affect californias fiscal outlook and cause the state to continue facing acute longterm challenges and budget deficits current budget the california state budget for the  fiscal year the  budget act was passed by the state legislature and signed by the governor on june   the  budget act projected general fund revenues and transfers in fiscal year  of  billion including the  billion balance carried over from the  fiscal year and authorized general fund expenditures of  billion for the fiscal year ended june   the  budget established a multiyear plan to eliminate the  billion in unfunded accrued liability in the california state teachers retirement system calstrs by increasing contributions from the state school districts and teachers over time and consistent with that strategy the  budget act includes a  billion general fund allocation for state contributions to calstrs in its annual report on californias fiscal outlook released on november   the fiscal report the lao provided an independent assessment of californias economic outlook and the states projected general fund revenues and expenditures the fiscal report which described the budget situation through  as decidedly positive estimated that california would continue to experience growth in general fund revenues resulting in budget surpluses of  billion by the end of fiscal year  and  billion at the end of  the fiscal report notes that under this scenario the legislature would have control over  billion in the special fund for economic uncertainties with the rest of the reserves held for future budget emergencies as required by proposition  while the lao considered continued economic growth its main forecast scenario the fiscal report cautioned that its outlook was based on the assumption that the economy will continue to grow through  and that no additional budget commitments will be made the lao cautioned that budget surpluses could be reduced or eliminated if among other things  the economy is weak or  if the states two key pension boards lower their assumptions concerning future investment returns which would require state contributions to calstrs and calpers defined below to increase the governors proposed budget for the  fiscal year the   governors budget released on january   provided an update to the states economic outlook at the end of the  fiscal year relative to the  budget act the  governors budget projected general fund revenues and transfers of  billion an increase of  billion and general fund expenditures of  billion an increase of  million for the  fiscal year assuming all of the budgetary actions proposed by the governor are successfully implemented the  governors budget projected a budget reserve of  billion plus a contribution to the states new rainy day fund of  billion as of june   the  governors budget reiterated the fiscal goals contained in the  budget act for the state to eliminate the wall of debt and pay down the states unfunded retirement liabilities future budgets the  governors budget projected general fund revenues and transfers in fiscal year  of  billion and proposed general fund expenditures of  billion for the fiscal year ended june   assuming adoption of all proposed budget measures including  billion increase in funding for state and local transportation and infrastructure programs and further reduction of californias wall of debt the  governors budget also proposed a plan to eliminate the unfunded retirement liabilities of the state by fiscal year  through costsharing arrangements between the state and public employees with respect to retiree health benefits such costsharing arrangements will require the approval of applicable public employee bargaining units at the time of labor contract renewals assuming enactment of the proposed budgets corrective actions the  governors budget projected a  billion available reserve and a rainy day fund contribution of  billion at the end of the  fiscal year in its january   overview of the governors budget the lao overview the lao projected much greater revenue collection by the state in fiscal year  but cautioned that the states long period of revenue growth may be reaching its peak the lao commended the governors continued commitment to fiscal discipline and emphasis on building up reserves and encouraged the legislature to set robust targets for reserves for the end of the  fiscal year and to concentrate spending on onetime purposes before beginning the process of choosing a mix of reserves one time spending and ongoing budget commitments the lao overview emphasized that californias longterm budgetary plans remain vulnerable to market downturns that may reemerge with little warning which makes building sizeable reserves to allay future revenue volatility an ongoing priority it cannot be predicted what actions will be taken in the future by the legislature and the governor to deal with changing state revenues and expenditures the state budget will be affected by national and state economic conditions and other factors constraints on the budget process constitutional amendments approved by voters affect the budget process these include proposition  approved in  and amended by voters effective as of the  fiscal year which requires the state to enact a balanced budget establish a special rainy day fund in the general fund and restrict future borrowing to cover budget deficits and proposition  approved by voters in  which decreased the vote required for the legislature to adopt a final budget from a twothirds majority vote to a simple majority vote proposition  retained the twothirds vote requirement for taxes as a result of the provisions requiring the enactment of a balanced budget and restricting borrowing the state may in some cases have to take immediate actions during the fiscal year to correct budgetary shortfalls the balanced budget determination is made by subtracting expenditures from all available resources including prioryear balances if the governor determines that the state is facing substantial revenue shortfalls or spending deficiencies the governor is authorized to declare a fiscal emergency and call the legislature into special session to consider proposed legislation to address the emergency if the legislature fails to pass and send to the governor legislation to address the budgetary or fiscal emergency within  days the legislature would be prohibited from acting on any other bills or adjourning in joint recess until such legislation is passed during the economic downturn from fiscal year  to fiscal year  the governor declared fiscal emergencies on january   december   july   january   july   november   and january   and called five special sessions of the legislature to resolve the budget imbalances enact economic stimulus and address the states liquidity problems proposition  adopted as section  of article xvi of the states constitution also requires  of estimated annual general fund revenues to be transferred by the controller into a rainy day fund the budget stabilization account no later than september  of each fiscal year these transfers will be made until the balance in the budget stabilization account reaches  billion or  of the estimated general fund revenues for that fiscal year whichever is greater and then whenever the balance falls below the  billion or  target the annual transfers can be suspended or reduced for a fiscal year by an executive order issued by the governor no later than june  of the preceding fiscal year the governor issued such an executive order for each fiscal year from  through  the  budget act projects a transfer of  billion to the budget stabilization account as of june   half of which would be used to repay outstanding economic recovery bonds commencing in the  fiscal year proposition  approved by voters in the november  general election amends proposition  to require  of estimated annual general fund revenues and an additional specified portion of general fund revenues attributable to personal income taxes on net capital gains to be transferred by the controller into the budget stabilization account no later than october  of each fiscal year these transfers will be made until the balance in the budget stabilization account reaches  of the estimated general fund revenues for that fiscal year from the  fiscal year until the  fiscal year half of the general fund revenues which would be transferrable to the budget stabilization account will be used to repay deferred budgetary obligations including unfunded state pension plan obligations and outstanding economic recovery bonds as a result of the amendment under proposition  the annual transfers may only be suspended or reduced by a bill passed by the legislature in response to the governors proclamation of a budget emergency and withdrawals from the budget stabilization account during budget emergencies are subject to limitations proposition  prohibits certain future borrowing to cover budget deficits this restriction applies to general obligation bonds revenue bonds and certain other forms of longterm borrowing the restriction does not apply to certain other types of borrowing such as shortterm borrowing to cover cash shortfalls in the general fund including revenue anticipation notes or revenue anticipation warrants currently used by the state or interfund borrowings proposition  also creates a public school system stabilization account for the support of california school districts and community college districts general fund revenues attributable to personal income taxes on net capital gains in excess of the specified portion dedicated to the budget stabilization account are required to be transferred by the controller to the public school system stabilization account under current projections proposition

of february   the state had approximately  billion aggregate principal of outstanding longterm general obligation bonds the current estimate of the interest to be paid on the principal amount

legislation providing  billion in funds for flood protection projects and projects to improve access to water supplies the funding package includes  million for drinking water and recycling projects  million to provide immediate assistance to communities facing water supply issues and  million to help the state deal with drought related environmental issues of the  billion package  million is from previously approved general obligation bonds  million is from cap and trade proceeds  million is from special funds and approximately  million is from the general fund under certain circumstances the state also provides infrastructure funding assistance to local governments and the private sector such as for schools and local transportation programs water projects housing developments and hospitals deferred obligations as part of the budget solutions in fiscal years during the recession the state repeatedly deferred payment of certain general fund obligations including proposition  payments to schools medical reimbursements state payrolls and payments to the state pension fund and approved the sale of economic recovery bonds interfund borrowing and loans from state and local governments as a result of these shortterm budgetbalancing actions the general fund is obligated to repay or make reimbursements in future years the states enacted budgets for fiscal years    and  reduced these repayment obligations from  billion to  billion the  governors act proposed further reductions in californias deferred obligations by  billion and projected that all outstanding budgetary deferrals and borrowing of the state will be repaid by the end of the  fiscal year state pension funds the two main state pension funds the california public employees retirement system calpers and calstrs currently have substantial unfunded liabilities on april   calpers estimated that its unfunded accrued liability as of june   was  billion on a market value of assets basis calstrs reported that the unfunded actuarial liability of its defined benefit plan as of june   was  billion on an actuarial basis and  billion on a market value basis the state also has an unfunded liability relating to other state retirees postemployment health care benefits which is estimated to be  billion as of june   general fund contributions to calpers and calstrs for fiscal year  are estimated to be approximately  billion and  billion respectively the  budget act also enacted a plan to eliminate calstrs current unfunded liability by the  fiscal year by increasing the mandatory contributions by the state teachers and school districts there can be no assurances that the states annual required contributions to calpers will not also significantly increase in the future on september   the state adopted the public employees pension reform act of  which reduces pension benefits for newlyhired calpers employees encourages later retirement and caps compensation in calculating pension benefits for higherincome employees in a preliminary actuarial analysis calpers estimated that the reform legislation will reduce costs to the state by  billion to  billion over the next  years medical and health care reform following the implementation of the affordable care act total medical enrollment rose from  million in fiscal year  to  million in fiscal year  covering over  of the states population the  governors budget projected general fund expenditures in fiscal year  of  billion for californias medical program after the application of federal matching funds the  governors budget estimated additional medical caseload of  million individuals and costs of  billion related to the implementation of the affordable care act california will share the cost with the federal government the net impact of the health care reform on the states budget will depend on a number of factors including levels of individual and employer participation and any changes in the federal matching rate and insurance premiums actual costs could differ materially as the affordable care act is implemented and as the california legislature realigns responsibility for certain health care and longterm care programs between the state and local governments local government the primary units of local government in california are the counties which vary significantly in size and population there are also hundreds of incorporated cities and thousands of other special districts formed for education utility and other services counties are responsible for provision of many basic services including indigent healthcare welfare courts jails and public safety in unincorporated areas the  budget act instituted a major realignment of responsibility for public safety programs from the state to local governments including certain criminal justice programs mental health services substance abuse treatment child and elderly welfare programs and the california work opportunity and responsibility to kids calworks with the implementation of the federal affordable care act counties are expected to experience significant savings in their indigent healthcare programs as participants enroll in the states expanded medical program in recognition of this shift in responsibility for indigent healthcare the  budget act established a mechanism to redirect a portion of each countys cost savings to benefit the state local governments are limited in their ability to raise revenues due to constitutional constraints on their ability to impose or increase various taxes fees and assessments without voter approval counties in particular have had fewer options to raise revenues than many other local government entities local governments in california have experienced notable financial difficulties from time to time and there is no assurance that any california issuer will make full or timely payments of principal or interest or remain solvent it should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by local california issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of obligations issued by the state and there is no obligation on the part of the state to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default proposition a enacted by the legislature and approved by the voters in november  has reduced the legislatures authority over local government revenue sources by placing restrictions on the states access to local governments property sales and vehicle licensing revenues proposition a also prohibits the state from mandating activities on cities counties or special districts without providing for the funding needed to comply with the mandates the state mandate provisions of proposition a do not apply to schools or community colleges or to mandates relating to employee rights proposition  enacted by the legislature and approved by the voters in november  supersedes proposition a and prohibits any future borrowing by the state from local government funds and generally prohibits the legislature from making changes in local government funding sources allocation of local transportation funds cannot be changed without an extensive process constitutional and legislative factors initiative constitutional amendments affecting state and local taxes and appropriations have been proposed and adopted pursuant to the states initiative process from time to time if any such initiatives are adopted the state could be pressured to provide additional financial assistance to local governments or appropriate revenues as mandated by such initiatives propositions that may be adopted in the future may also place increasing pressure on the states budget over future years potentially reducing resources available for other state programs especially to the extent any mandated spending limits would restrain the states ability to fund such other programs by raising taxes because of the complexities of constitutional amendments and related legislation concerning appropriations and spending limits the ambiguities and possible inconsistencies in their terms the applicability of any exceptions and exemptions and the impossibility of predicting future appropriations it is not possible to predict the impact on the bonds in the portfolio of the california series effect of other state laws on bond obligations some of the california municipal securities in which the california series can invest may be obligations payable solely from the revenues of a specific institution or secured by specific properties these are subject to provisions of california law that could adversely affect the holders of such obligations for example the revenues of california healthcare institutions may be adversely affected by state laws reducing medical reimbursement rates and california law limits the remedies available to a creditor secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on real property debt obligations payable solely from revenues of healthcare institutions may also be insured by the state but no guarantee exists that adequate reserve funds will be appropriated by the legislature for such purpose litigation the state is a party to numerous legal proceedings many of which normally occur in governmental operations in addition the state is involved in certain other legal proceedings that if decided against the state might require the state to make significant future expenditures or impair future revenue sources because of the prospective nature of these proceedings it is not presently possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or estimate the potential impact on the ability of the state to pay debt service costs on its obligations on march   the trial court in the rehabilitation center of beverly hills et al v department of health services et al ruled that the quality assurance fee qaf charged to skilled nursing facilities since  was properly characterized as a tax rather than a fee the trial court then denied the plaintiffs claim for refund of qaf amounts finding that the qaf was constitutionally valid plaintiffs have appealed the denial of refund the qaf amounts collected from all providers is approximately  billion and california has received additional federal financial participation based on its imposition and collection of the qaf an adverse ruling could also negatively affect the states receipt of federal funds on october   the san francisco county superior court in gillette company v franchise tax board a consolidation of six actions by several multistate corporations ruled that the legislatures modification of the revenue and taxation code implementing a doubleweighted sales factor in californias apportionment of income formula for the taxation of multistate business entities was valid and constitutional the california court of appeal first appellate district reversed the trial court judgment and in its decision issued in october  held that the state was bound by the singleweighted sales factor contained in the multistate tax compact for the tax years at issue and that attempting to override the multistate tax compact violated the constitutional protections against impairment of contracts the state has requested and the supreme court has accepted review of this case the adverse ruling in this consolidated case affects multiple taxpayers and creates potential exposure to refund claims in excess of  million on august   the los angeles superior court ruled in favor of the plaintiff in nortel networks inc v state board of equalization a tax refund case involving the interpretation of certain statutory sales and use tax exemptions for computer software and licenses to use computer software that are transferred pursuant to technology transfer agreements on january   the adverse trial court ruling was upheld by the california court of appeal and a petition for review filed by the state board was denied by the california supreme court the adverse trial court ruling if applied to other similarly situated taxpayers unless limited in scope by two similar refund cases filed by lucent technologies inc against the state board of equalization could have a significant negative impact in the range of approximately  million annually on tax revenues two cases seeking to proceed as class actions bakersfield mall llc v franchise tax board and cacenterside ii llc v franchise tax board challenge the fee imposed by the california tax code upon limited liability companies registered in california alleging discrimination against interstate commerce violation the us and california constitutions improper exercise of the states police powers and misapplication by the franchise tax board the cases were coordinated for hearing as the franchise tax board llc tax refund cases and subsequently denied class certification by a coordination trial judge if the appealable order is reversed and either case proceeds as a class action the claimed refunds could be in excess of  million in gail marie harringtonwisely et al v state of california et al a class action asserting that the use by the california department of corrections and rehabilitation the cdcr of a bodyimaging machine to search visitors to state prisons for contraband violated the rights of the visitors the trial court granted judgment in favor of the state and plaintiffs appeal was dismissed by the california court of appeal second appellate district the parties agreed to a stipulated judgment and dismissed the case subject to further review on or after  if the cdcr uses similar technology in the future if plaintiffs were successful in obtaining damages for every use of the bodyimaging machine damages could be as high as

information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in your georgia trust and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject additionally many factors including national economic social and environmental policies and conditions which are not within the control of the issuers of such bonds could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the state and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof the sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in your georgia trust the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired by your georgia trust to pay interest on or principal of such bonds your georgia trust is susceptible to political economic or regulatory factors affecting issuers of georgia municipal obligations the georgia municipal obligations these include the possible adverse effects of certain georgia constitutional amendments legislative measures voter initiatives and other matters that are described the information provided above is only a brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in georgia and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are believed to be accurate no independent verification has been made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information it is based in part on information obtained from various state and local agencies in georgia or contained in official statements for various georgia municipal obligations puerto rico risk factors certain trusts may invest in bonds issued by issuers located in puerto rico puerto rico or the commonwealth as further described under ratings puerto ricos general obligation bonds are all currently rated below investment grade following a number of downgrades by the major credit rating agencies as a result the commonwealths access to the liquidity markets may be limited and further the commonwealth may not be able to honor all of its obligations as they come due on april   the commonwealth filed a notice of failure to file annual report which stated that the commonwealth did not provide its audited financial statements for fiscal year  by the filing deadline of may   as required by its continuing disclosure undertakings made in connection with its bond issuances and that the commonwealth expected to file its  financial statements by july   however the annual report has not yet been filed as of october  therefore some of the information contained below although the most recent data may not be representative of the commonwealths current economic condition relevant history puerto rico came under united states sovereignty in  in  congress enacted public law  which provided that the existing political economic and fiscal relationship between puerto rico and the united states would remain the same but puerto rico would be authorized to draft and approve its own constitution guaranteeing a republican form of government the constitution of puerto rico was ratified by the united states congress and subsequently approved by the president of the united states puerto rico is a selfgoverning commonwealth in association with the united states the united states and the commonwealth share a common defense market and currency puerto rico exercises virtually the same control over its internal affairs as any of the fifty states of the united states however it differs from the states in its relationship with the united states federal government the people of puerto rico are citizens of the united states but do not vote in national elections they can only vote in local puerto rico elections the people of the commonwealth are represented in congress by a resident commissioner who has a voice in the house of representatives and limited voting power the chief of state of the commonwealth is the president of the united states the head of government is an elected governor there are two legislative chambers the house of representatives and the senate most federal taxes except those such as social security taxes are not levied in puerto rico no federal income tax is collected from puerto rico residents on income sourced in puerto rico except for certain federal employees who are subject to taxes on their salaries income earned by puerto rico residents from sources outside of puerto rico however is subject to federal income tax geographic location and demography puerto rico is the fourth largest of the caribbean islands and is located approximately  miles southeast of new york it is approximately  miles long and  miles wide according to united states census bureau estimates the population of puerto rico reflected a decrease to approximately  as of  according to a united states census bureau estimate compared to  in  changes in population have had and may continue to have an impact on economic growth and on the growth of tax revenues continued reductions in population particularly of working age individuals may have an adverse effect on tax and other government revenues that will not be entirely offset by reductions in government expenses in the short and medium term in addition the average age of the population of puerto rico is increasing partly due to a reduction in birth rate but primarily as a result of the migration of younger persons to the united states mainland this may increase the demand for health and other services upon the commonwealth and the cost to the commonwealth of providing such services thus imposing limitations on the commonwealths ability to achieve a balanced budget and improve its financial condition relationship with the united states while puerto rico has authority over its internal affairs the united states controls interstate trade foreign relations and commerce customs administration control of air land and sea immigration and emigration nationality and citizenship currency maritime laws military service military bases army navy and air force declaration of war constitutionality of laws jurisdictions and legal procedures treaties radio and television communications agriculture mining and minerals highways postal system social security and other areas generally controlled by the federal government in the united states puerto rican institutions control internal affairs unless us law is involved as in matters of public health and pollution puerto rico also lacks certain assignation of some revenues reserved for the states economy the commonwealth has established policies and programs directed principally at developing the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy and expanding and modernizing the commonwealths infrastructure domestic and foreign investment have been stimulated by selective tax exemptions development loans and other financial and tax incentives infrastructure expansion and modernization have been primarily financed by bonds and notes issued by the commonwealth its public corporations and municipalities economic progress has been aided by significant increases in the levels of education and occupational skills of the commonwealths population the economy of puerto rico is closely linked to the united states economy as most of the external factors that affect the local economy are determined by the policies and performance of the mainland economy these external factors include exports direct investment the amount of federal transfer payments the level of interest rates the rate of inflation and tourist expenditures puerto ricos economy is closely linked to the united states economy approximately  of puerto ricos exports go to the united states and  of the imports come from the united states in recent fiscal years however the performance of puerto ricos economy has not been consistent with the performance of the united states economy puerto ricos economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  puerto rico has a diversified economy with manufacturing and services comprising its principal sectors in the last three decades industrial development in puerto rico has been relatively capital intensive and dependent on skilled labor puerto rico has experienced mixed results in the service sector which includes wholesale and retail trade utilities transportation and warehousing information finance and insurance real estate and rental and certain services such as professional scientific technical management administrative support educational health care social recreational accommodation food and other services this sector has expanded in terms of income over the past decade following the general trend of other industrialized economies but with differences on the magnitudes of those changes the development of the service sector has been positively affected by demand generated by other sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and construction tourism makes a significant contribution to economic activity an estimated  billion were spent by visitors in puerto rico during fiscal year  san juan is the largest homeport for cruise ships in the caribbean and one of the largest homeports for cruise ships in the world during the fiscal year  the number of persons registered in tourist hotels increased  compared with fiscal year  however that number has stayed stagnant into fiscal year  fiscal year  saw record arrivals of cruise ship passengers with an impact on the local economy of approximately  million the gross national product of puerto rico was  billion in fiscal year  compared to  billion in fiscal year  aggregate personal income increased from  billion in fiscal year  to  billion in fiscal year  and personal income per capita increased from  in fiscal year  to  in fiscal year  according to the household survey during the first nine months of fiscal year  total employment fell by  as compared to the same period for the prior fiscal year and the unemployment rate averaged  compared to  for the same period of the prior fiscal year the current unemployment rate in puerto rico as of october  is  debt revenues and expenditures total assets and total liabilities of the commonwealths primary government at june   amounted to  billion and  billion respectively for a net deficit of  billion compared to a  billion net deficit at the beginning of  the commonwealth had a net deficit of  billion in the governmental activities and a net deficit of  billion in the general fund as of june   which has resulted from operating deficits over the last several years the commonwealths high level of debt and the resulting required allocation of revenues to service this debt have contributed to these deficits and have adversely affected its credit ratings the commonwealths expenses cover a range of services the largest expenses were for general government education public housing and welfare health and public safety which presented a combined increase of approximately  million when compared with prior fiscal year in  governmental activities expenses exceeded program revenue by approximately  billion resulting in the use of approximately  billion of general revenue and transfers from other funds mostly taxes the commonwealths most recent projection is that it will close fiscal year  with a budget deficit in the range of  million to  million an amount that when adjusted for actual tax refunds paid in this fiscal year in excess of the reserve included in the budget for fiscal year  increases the deficit to a range of  million to  million as of march   the commonwealth had outstanding a total of  billion aggregate principal amount of bonds and notes issued or guaranteed by the commonwealth or payable from general fund appropriations equivalent to approximately  of the commonwealths gross national product for fiscal year   billion  preliminary debt service for fiscal year  on these bonds and notes payable from the general fund  billion represents approximately  of the general fund budget for fiscal year   billion maximum annual debt service on these bonds and notes  billion in fiscal year  represents approximately  of the general fund budget for fiscal year  the total outstanding public sector debt of the commonwealth its instrumentalities and municipalities was  billion as of march   equivalent to approximately  of the commonwealths gross national product for fiscal year  as of october  preliminary general fund revenues for the first ten months of fiscal year  were approximately  billion an increase of  million when compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year but  million less than the originally estimated revenues for the period the commonwealths very high level of debt has contributed to significant budget deficits during the past several years which deficits the commonwealth has been required to finance further increasing the amount of its debt the commonwealths high level of debt among other factors has adversely affected its credit ratings and its ability to obtain financing at favorable interest rates ratings as of october  the credit ratings of the commonwealths general obligation bonds were lowered to caa by moodys investors service moodys cc by standard  poors rating services sp and cc by fitch ratings fitch each of which is noninvestment grade sp moodys and fitch each assigned a negative outlook on the commonwealths ratings any explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies there is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn credit ratings and liquidity the liquidity of the commonwealth has been adversely affected by the ratings downgrades described above by the significant increase in credit spreads for obligations of the commonwealth and its instrumentalities by the limited market access experienced by the commonwealth and its instrumentalities during the second half of  and by a significant reduction of liquidity in the local puerto rico capital markets under current market conditions in part as a result of the recent ratings downgrades the commonwealth may have limited capital market access if the commonwealth does not have sufficient access to the capital markets or alternative sources of financing to satisfy its liquidity needs it may not be able to honor all of its obligations as they come due given the recent liquidity issues faced by the commonwealth it has hired a usbased consulting firm to perform a liquidity analysis of the commonwealth assist with the implementation of measures to improve cash management and forecasting procedures and provide assistance to the puerto rico treasury department the treasury department or treasury in the development of short and mediumterm cash flow projections relationships with creditors and business counterparties changes in the commonwealths credit ratings could affect its relationships with creditors and other business counterparties for example certain of the commonwealths shortterm financings variable rate debt obligations and mandatory tender bonds include provisions that permit the acceleration of such debt instruments based on the downgrade of the commonwealths ratings below investment grade moreover the commonwealths interest rate exchange agreements include provisions that permit the counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate the agreements based on the downgrade of the commonwealths ratings below investment grade the commonwealth recently optionally terminated certain of its interest rate exchange agreements and in connection therewith made aggregate termination payments of approximately  million to a counterparty to date however the commonwealth has not been required to post collateral in connection with any of its interest rate exchange agreements and the commonwealths counterparties have not accelerated any debt obligations or terminated any interest rate exchange agreements as a result of such downgrades if the counterparties entitled to accelerate debt obligations or terminate the remaining interest rate exchange agreements exercise their respective rights there is no assurance that the commonwealth would be able to honor all such obligations as they come due local issuances it should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by local puerto rican issuers may be unrelated to the
