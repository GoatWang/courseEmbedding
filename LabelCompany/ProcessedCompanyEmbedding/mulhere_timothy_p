mulhere  naperville magazine naperville magazine naperville magazine  sections  business  business profile  timothy p mulhere business business profile  timothy p mulhere by mark zonca september  view more business photo by mike hudson with shrinking natural resourcesaround the world and the growing demand for a clean and sustainable water supply ecolab a global leader in water hygiene and energy technologies and services is using technology to find new solutions naperville magazine recently spoke with timothy p mulhere executive vice president and president of global water and process services for ecolab about the biggest challenges facing his company as leader of ecolab’s global water and process services which operates under the nalco name what is your proudest accomplishment it’s hard to point to one specific accomplishment i’m most proud of but i think in general i’m most proud of our people it’s very gratifying to see our people take an idea and turn it into a solution that solves an issue a customer may have and this happens every day in rd in sales in our functional groups i also love seeing our associates develop and excel it’s very rewarding when you see people take on new roles or new challenges and they flourish as a result of that growth nalco has several products designed to reduce energy water and other natural resource consumption what is your most successful product d trasar™ technology is definitely nalco’s keystone technology it originated as a program for treating the water in industrial cooling systems but it has since expanded to many other industrial and institutional applications including process and wastewater and continues to grow we recently sold our th unit and are preparing to roll out enhancements that will lay the foundation for the next generation of this technology that will keep it in on the leading edge of monitoring and control offerings for years to come d trasar technology monitors water systems in real time and applies control technology and  information management capabilities to detect determine and deliver improved performance in cooling boiler and membrane systems it detects upsets that precede common system challenges and delivers the appropriate chemical response either remotely or by sending corrective information to our onsite sales and service team the result is a balanced efficient and safe cooling boiler or membrane system there’s less maintenance no over or underdosing of chemistries lower operating costs and maximum asset protection what is the biggest global challenge nalco is addressing in terms of dwindling natural resources the world is facing unprecedented challenges related to water—an area of considerable expertise for us—so we’ve been working to expand our reach beyond our operations to advance sustainable water management practices around the world specifically in many of the world’s most water stressed regions as an example we have a customer who cannot increase their capacity to meet demand because local water supplies are limited we are helping to increase the amount of water they are able to recycle and reuse and decrease overall water consumption to allow for increased production which help the customer meet demand and grow their business while considering overall community impact  we also work through partnerships and initiatives to advance water stewardship practices in  ecolab fieldtested the alliance for water stewardship’s “beta” water stewardship standard at two sites within china’s most critical watershed to test its feasibility and applicability learnings from that pilot shaped the first international water stewardship standard launched in april at the un ceo water mandate multistakeholder working conference in lima peru the standard helps water users implement responsible water practices to reduce risks related to water quantity and quality work collaboratively with neighboring water users to address shared challenges and minimize environmental impact what type of work is being done at the company’s naperville office i mentioned earlier the work being done to both expand and strengthen our d trasar offering—much of this work is occurring within the rd and marketing groups in our naperville office much of the strategy work for our overall industrial water offering is occurring here as well we’re evaluating market opportunities and determining how best to meet a market need either through inhouse innovation or when appropriate through an acquisition we’re currently working to bring three recent pretreatment acquisitions within the nalco brand  you are involved in various community and professional organizations including the american chemistry council and the executives’ club of chicago how do you maintain a worklife balance  i believe having the right components in place helps to ensure one area of your life doesn’t consume a disproportionate amount of time the organizations you mentioned are workrelated but the time i spend doing this work is very different from the work i do in the office and this variety helps me stay energized i also try to be as disciplined as possible about leaving work at work technology has made it far more challenging to stay in the moment but i try to unplug as much as i can when i’m taking vacation or spending time with my family what gets you out of bed in the morning it’s very satisfying to see the impact of the work our company does both for our customers and for society ecolab’s purpose is to make the world cleaner safer and healthier to protect people and vital resources and ensure clean water safe food abundant energy and healthy environments having a profound impact on things that are so vital to life makes ecolab a great company to work for i am also on the board for the ecolab foundation and the focus on giving back to our communities is a very important part of our company culture working for ecolab is incredibly energizing when you see the positive impact we have on people throughout the world  share this page tweet   timothy mulhere  ecolab inc  zoominfocom timothy p mulhere  director at international dairy foods
