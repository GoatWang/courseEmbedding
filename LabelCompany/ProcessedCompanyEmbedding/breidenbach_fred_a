theodore “teddy” forstmann the founder of forstmann little  company is described in aviation circles as “the man who saved gulfstream” although forstmann was described on numerous occasions as “the master of the leveraged buyout” there were nevertheless raised eyebrows in  when he and allen paulson cut a deal to buy gulfstream from chrysler where it had been long neglected with little or no support or guidance paulson and forstmann paid  million for the savannah gabased business jet manufacturer with paulson holding  percent and forstmann  percent jeffrey rodengen author of the legend of gulfstream quoted forstmann as saying of gulfstream “here was the perfect company it dominated its business had a great product and was being let go by a giant company that simply didn’t have the time or resources to devote to it because its main business was cars–not jets” unfortunately the deal was consummated as the us economy slipped into a recession and more than once in those first years forstmann was advised to cut his losses and dump gulfstream which at the time was heavily leveraged and facing growing competition from bombardier aerospace but faced with the options “win lose or draw” forstmann saw only one and that was to win he knew that gulfstream had a good product what it lacked was good leadership and forstmann with his genius for hiring the best people at the right time set about correcting that in  fred breidenbach joined the company as coo and chris davis a year veteran of general electric took over as cfo that same year forstmann himself took on the job of chairman and de facto ceo in  bill boisture was hired as a senior vp pres henne came in to head gv development and joe lombardo was hired to run coproduction programs of the givsp and gv then in  gulfstream dipped into competitor bombardier’s top leadership to hire bryan moss as vice chairman of gulfstream aerospace and ceo of gulfstream aircraft the board of directors consisted of an unprecedented brain trust and included henry kissinger former secretary of state donald rumsfeld former secretary of defense george p schultz former secretary of labor treasury and state michael ovitz  film industry agent and former president of walt disney company and general colin powell former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gulfstream goes public by the mids with the givsp and new gv in production gulfstream’s revenues were soaring and in  the backlog value was  billion a year later gulfstream was planning  deliveries an percent jump from  the company had also grabbed  percent of the service and parts business for its aircraft and revenues were  billion by the end of the decade gulfstream was doing almost all its own cabin completion work and was focused on seeing that every gulfstream returned to the company for service cabin refurbishment or upgrades gulfstream was no longer selling an airplane it was selling an entire package that included product service at any gulfstream center in  forstmann took gulfstream public selling  million shares in a successful initial public offering forstmann met with the board of directors in  and broached the subject of moving gulfstream forward but according to rodengen it was not an easy decision “i just hated the idea of selling gulfstream” said forstmann “i would like to have gulfstream until i ended…i love the people without them there’s no way we could have been as successful as we were” with that gulfstream passed to general dynamics for  billion not a bad return for an original investment of  million in a little less than  years but it wasn’t all about money for forstmann it was about winning and he made gulfstream and all those with him winners perhaps it would indeed be an appropriate epitaph on a marker at the main gates of the savannahbased manufacturer so all who pass through can remember–ted forstmann the man who saved gulfstream   gulfstream ownership and major events –the grumman aircraft
