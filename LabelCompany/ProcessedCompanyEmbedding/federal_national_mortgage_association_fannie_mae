fannie maes reston virginia facility the great depression wrought havoc on the us housing market by  an estimated  to  of the nations outstanding mortgage debt was in default fannie mae was established in  by amendments to the national housing act as part of franklin delano roosevelts new deal originally chartered as the national mortgage association of washington the organizations explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home mortgages in an attempt to raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing fannie mae created a liquid secondary mortgage market and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans primarily by buying federal housing administration fha insured mortgages for the first thirty years following its inception fannie mae held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market other considerations may have motivated the new deal focus on the housing market about a third of the nations unemployed were in the building trade and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build fannie mae was acquired by the housing and home finance agency from the federal loan agency as a constituent unit in  in  an amendment known as the federal national mortgage association charter act made fannie mae into mixedownership corporation meaning that federal government held the preferred stock while private investors held the common stock in  it converted to a privately held corporation to remove its activity and debt from the federal budget in the  change arising from the housing and urban development act of  fannie maes predecessor also called fannie mae was split into the current fannie mae and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae ginnie mae which remained a government organization supports fhainsured mortgages as well as veterans administration va and farmers home administration fmha insured mortgages as such ginnie mae is the only homeloan agency explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government in  the federal government authorized fannie mae to purchase conventional mortgages the same year it went public on new york and pacific exchanges residential mortgage loan origination nd edition pg jkeith baker  ie those not insured by the fha va or fmha and created the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc colloquially known as freddie mac to compete with fannie mae and thus facilitate a more robust and efficient secondary mortgage market in  fannie mae issued its first mortgage passthrough and called it a mortgagebacked security the fannie mae laws did not require the banks to hand out subprime loans in any way ginnie mae had guaranteed the first mortgage passthrough security of an approved lender in  and in  freddie mac issued its first mortgage passthrough called a participation certificate composed primarily of private mortgages sedit in  president george hw bush signed the housing and community development act of  the act amended the charter of fannie mae and freddie mac to reflect the democratic congress view that the gses have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low and moderateincome families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return for the first time the gses were required to meet affordable housing goals set annually by the department of housing and urban development hud and approved by congress the initial annual goal for lowincome and moderateincome mortgage purchases for each gse was  of the total number of dwelling units financed by mortgage purchases and increased to  by  in  fannie mae came under pressure from the clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income borrowers by increasing the ratios of their loan portfolios in distressed inner city areas designated in the community reinvestment act cra of  additionally community reinvestment act regulators under the direction of hud secretary andrew cuomo gave higher ratings to banks that financed home loans to creditdeprived areas in essence banks were rewarded for bypassing loan standards and instead approving loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting if banks did not adhere to these rules then the cra watchdogs limited their ability to lend  in  the new york times reported that with the corporations move towards the subprime market fannie mae is taking on significantly more risk which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times but the governmentsubsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the s sedit franklin raines earned  million in salary and bonuses while he was head of fannie mae in  because of a reassessment of the housing market by hud antipredatory lending rules were put into place that disallowed risky highcost loans from being credited toward affordable housing goals in  these rules were dropped and highrisk loans were again counted toward affordable housing goals the intent was that fannie maes enforcement of the underwriting standards they maintained for standard conforming mortgages would also provide safe and stable means of lending to buyers who did not have prime credit as daniel mudd then president and ceo of fannie mae testified in  instead the agencys underwriting requirements drove business into the arms of the private mortgage industry who marketed aggressive products without regard to future consequences we also set conservative underwriting standards for loans we finance to ensure the homebuyers can afford their loans over the long term we sought to bring the standards we apply to the prime space to the subprime market with our industry partners primarily to expand our services to underserved families unfortunately fannie maequality safe loans in the subprime market did not become the standard and the lending market moved away from us borrowers were offered a range of loans that layered teaser rates interestonly negative amortization and payment options and lowdocumentation requirements on top of floatingrate loans in early  we began sounding our concerns about this layeredrisk lending for example tom lund the head of our singlefamily mortgage business publicly stated one of the things we dont feel good about right now as we look into this marketplace is more homebuyers being put into programs that have more risk those products are for more sophisticated buyers does it make sense for borrowers to take on risk they may not be aware of are we setting them up for failure as a result we gave up significant market share to our competitors alex berenson of the new york times reported in  that fannie maes risk is much larger than is commonly held nassim taleb wrote in the black swan the governmentsponsored institution fannie mae when i look at its risks seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite vulnerable to the slightest hiccup but not to worry their large staff of scientists deem these events unlikely on january   the federal housing enterprise regulatory reform act of  s was first introduced in the senate by sen chuck hagel the senate legislation was an effort to reform the existing gse regulatory structure in light of the recent accounting problems and questionable management actions leading to considerable income restatements by the gses after being reported favorably by the senates committee on banking housing and urban affairs in july  the bill was never considered by the full senate for a vote sen john mccains decision to become a cosponsor of s almost a year later in  was the last action taken regarding sen hagels bill in spite of developments since clearing the senate committee sen mccain pointed out that fannie maes regulator reported that profits were illusions deliberately and systematically created by the companys senior management in his floor statement giving support to s at the same time the house also introduced similar legislation the federal housing finance reform act of  hr  in the spring of  the house financial services committee had crafted changes and produced a committee report by july  to the legislation it was passed by the house in october in spite of president bushs statement of policy opposed to the house version which stated the regulatory regime envisioned by hr  is considerably weaker than that which governs other large complex financial institutions the legislation met with opposition from both democrats and republicans at that point and the senate never took up the house passed version for consideration after that the mortgage crisis from late edit following their mission to meet federal housing and urban development hud housing goals gses such as fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks fhlbanks had striven to improve home ownership of low and middle income families underserved areas and generally through special affordable methods such as the ability to obtain a year fixedrate mortgage with a low down payment and the continuous availability of mortgage credit under a wide range of economic conditions then in – the subprime mortgage crisis began the market shifted away from regulated gses and radically toward mortgage backed securities mbs issued by unregulated privatelabel securitization conduits typically operated by investment banks as mortgage originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label mbss gses lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators competition between the gses and private securitizers for loans further undermined gses power and strengthened mortgage originators this contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis investment bank securitizers were more willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk whereas the gses guaranteed the performance of their mbss private securitizers generally did not and might only retain a thin slice of risk often banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through credit default swaps making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern the shift toward riskier mortgages and private label mbs distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels that had been elevated during – by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates earnings depended on volume so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the gses would not initially securitize thus the shift away from gse securitization to privatelabel securitization pls also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type from traditional amortizing fixedrate mortgages frms to nontraditional structurally riskier nonamortizing adjustablerate mortgages arms and in the start of a sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards the growth of pls however forced the gses to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders shareholder pressure pushed the gses into competition with pls for market share and the gses loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete in contrast the wholly public fhaginnie mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share the growth of privatelabel securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led in  to an increasing number of borrowers often with poor credit who were unable to pay their mortgages – particularly with adjustable rate mortgages arm caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures as a result home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages this depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the gses which back the majority of us mortgages in july  the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that fannie mae and freddie mac play a central role in the us housing finance system the us treasury department and the federal reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations including granting both corporations access to federal reserve lowinterest loans at similar rates as commercial banks and removing the prohibition on the treasury department to purchase the gses stock despite these efforts by august  shares of both fannie mae and freddie mac had tumbled more than  from their oneyear prior levels on oct   fhfa estimates revealed that the bailout of freddie mac and fannie mae will likely cost taxpayers – billion in total with over  billion already provided  – crisis and conservatorshipedit main article federal takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac on july   the new york times reported that us government officials were considering a plan for the us government to take over fannie mae andor freddie mac should their financial situations worsen due to the us housing crisis fannie mae and smaller freddie mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the united states and so were especially hard hit by the slump the government officials also stated that the government had also considered calling for explicit government guarantee through legislation of  trillion on debt owned or guaranteed by the two companies fannie stock plunged some worried that fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt others worried about a government seizure us treasury secretary henry m paulson as well as the white house went on the air to defend the financial soundness of fannie mae in a lastditch effort to prevent a total financial panic fannie and freddie underpinned the whole us mortgage market as recently as  fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac had owned or guaranteed about half of the uss  trillion mortgage market if they were to collapse mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive fannie and freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the chinese government to money market funds to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people if they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale the administration pr effort was not enough by itself to save the gses their government directive to purchase bad loans from private banks in order to prevent these banks from failing as well as the  top banks falsely classifying loans as aaa caused instability paulsons plan was to go in swiftly and seize the two gses rather than provide loans as he did for aig and the major banks he told president bush that the first sound they hear will be their heads hitting the floor in a reference to the french revolution the major banks have since been sued by the feds for a sum of  and some of the major banks have already settled in addition a lawsuit has been filed against the federal government by the shareholders of fannie mae and freddie mac for a creating an environment by which fannie and freddie would be unable to meet their financial obligations b forcing the executive management to sign over the companies to the conservator by a and c the gross violation of the fifth amendment taking clause on september   james lockhart director of the federal housing finance agency fhfa announced that fannie mae and freddie mac were being placed into conservatorship of the fhfa the action was one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades lockhart also dismissed the firms chief executive officers and boards of directors and caused the issuance to the treasury new senior preferred stock and common stock warrants amounting to  of each gse the value of the common stock and preferred stock to preconservatorship holders was greatly diminished by the suspension of future dividends on previously outstanding stock in the effort to maintain the value of company debt and of mortgagebacked securities fhfa stated that there are no plans to liquidate the company the authority of the us treasury to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing fannie mae or freddie mac is limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to the july   law enabling expanded regulatory authority over fannie mae and freddie mac increased the national debt ceiling us billion to a total of us trillion in anticipation of the potential need for the treasury to have the flexibility to support the federal home loan banks  – delistingedit on june   fannie mae and freddie mac announced their stocks would be delisted from the nyse the federal housing finance agency directed the delisting after fannies stock traded below  a share for over  days since then the stocks have continued to trade on the overthecounter bulletin board  –  billion dividendedit in may  fannie mae announced that it is going to pay a dividend of  billion to the united states treasury  –  billion dividend paidedit  billion received from treasury  billion paid to treasury fannie mae  financial results enabled them to pay  billion in dividends to treasury for the year resulting in a cumulative total of  billion in dividends through december   – approximately  billion more than fannie mae received in support as of march   fannie mae expects to have paid a total of  billion in payments to treasury businessedit fannie mae makes money partly by borrowing at low rates and then reinvesting its borrowings into whole mortgages and mortgage backed securities it borrows in the debt markets by selling bonds and provides liquidity to mortgage originators by purchasing whole loans it purchases whole loans and then securitizes them for the investment market by creating mbs that are either retained or sold as a government sponsored enterprise or gse fannie mae is compelled by law to provide liquidity to mortgage originators in all economic conditions it must legally ignore adverse market conditions which appear to be unprofitable if there are loans available for purchase that meet its predetermined underwriting standards it must purchase them if no other buyers are available due to the size scale and scope of the united states singlefamily residential and commercial residential markets market participants viewed fannie mae corporate debt as having a very high probability of being repaid fannie mae is able to borrow very inexpensively in the debt markets as a consequence of market perception there usually exists a large difference between the rate it can borrow at and the rate it can lend at this was called the big fat gap by alan greenspan by august  fannie maes mortgage portfolio was in excess of  billion fannie mae also earns a significant portion of its income from guaranty fees it receives as compensation for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying its singlefamily fannie mae mbs and on the singlefamily mortgage loans held in its retained portfolio investors or purchasers of fannie mae mbss are willing to let fannie mae keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk that is fannie maes guarantee that the scheduled principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid even if the borrower defaults fannie maes charter has historically prevented it from guaranteeing mortgages with a loantovalues over  without mortgage insurance or a repurchase agreement with the lender however in  and  fannie mae did purchase subprime and alta loans as investments business mechanismedit fannie mae is a purchaser of mortgages which it packages into mbs fannie mae buys loans from approved mortgage sellers and securitizes them it then sells the resultant mortgagebacked security to investors in the secondary mortgage market along with a guarantee that the stated principal and interest payments will be timely passed through to the investorcitation needed in addition fannie mbs like those of fannie mae mbs and ginnie mae mbs are eligible to be traded in the tobeannounced or tba market by purchasing the mortgages fannie mae and freddie mac provide banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new loans this gives the united states housing and credit markets flexibility and liquidity in order for fannie mae to provide its guarantee to mortgagebacked securities it issues it sets the guidelines for the loans that it will accept for purchase called conforming loans fannie mae produced an automated underwriting system aus tool called desktop underwriter du which lenders can use to automatically determine if a loan is conforming fannie mae followed this program up in  with custom du which allows lenders to set custom underwriting rules to handle nonconforming loans as well the secondary market for nonconforming loans includes jumbo loans which are mortgages larger than the maximum mortgage that fannie mae and freddie mac will purchase in early  the decision was made to allow tba tobeannouncedeligible mortgagebacked securities to include up to  jumbo mortgages conforming loansedit fannie mae and freddie mac have a limit on the maximum sized loan they will guarantee this is known as the conforming loan limit the conforming loan limit for fannie mae along with freddie mac is set by office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo the regulator of both gses ofheo annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan based on the october to october changes in mean home price above which a mortgage is considered a nonconforming jumbo loan the conforming loan limit is  percent higher in alaska and hawaii the gses only buy loans that are conforming to repackage into the secondary market lowering the demand for nonconforming loans by virtue of the law of supply and demand then it is harder for lenders to sell these loans in the secondary market thus these types of loans tend to cost more to borrowers typically  to  of a percent indeed in  since the demand for bonds not guaranteed by gses was almost nonexistent nonconforming loans were priced nearly  to  higher than conforming loans implicit guarantee and government supportedit originally fannie had an explicit guarantee from the government if it got in trouble the government promised to bail it out this changed in  ginnie mae was split off from fannie ginnie retained the explicit guarantee fannie however became a private corporation chartered by congress and with a direct line of credit to the us treasury it was its nature as a government sponsored enterprise gse that provided the implied guarantee for their borrowing the charter also limited their business activity to the mortgage market in this regard although they were a private company they could not operate like a regular private company fannie mae received no direct government funding or backing fannie mae securities carried no actual explicit government guarantee of being repaid this was clearly stated in the law that authorizes gses on the securities themselves and in many public communications issued by fannie maecitation needed neither the certificates nor payments of principal and interest on the certificates were explicitly guaranteed by the united states government the certificates did not legally constitute a debt or obligation of the united states or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than fannie mae during the subprime era every fannie mae prospectus read in bold allcaps letters the certificates and payments of principal and interest on the certificates are not guaranteed by the united states and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the united states or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than fannie mae verbiage changed from allcaps to standard case for readabilitycitation needed however the implied guarantee as well as various special treatments given to fannie by the government greatly enhanced its success for example the implied guarantee allowed fannie mae and freddie mac to save billions in borrowing costs as their credit rating was very good estimates by the congressional budget office and the treasury department put the figure at about  billion per year vernon l smith  nobel laureate in economics has called fhlmc and fnma implicitly taxpayerbacked agencies the economist has referred to the implicit government guarantee of fhlmc and fnma in testimony before the house and senate banking committee in  alan greenspan expressed the belief that fannie maes weak financial position was the result of markets believing that the us government would never allow fannie mae or freddie mac to fail fannie mae and freddie mac were allowed to hold less capital than normal financial institutions eg they were allowed to sell mortgagebacked securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions regulations exist through the fdic bank holding company act that govern the solvency of financial institutions the regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capitalasset ratio greater than or equal to  the gses fannie mae and freddie mac are exempt from this capitalasset ratio requirement and can and often do maintain a capitalasset ratio less than  the additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times but put the companies at greater risk in bad times such as during the subprime mortgage crisis fnma is not exempt from state and local taxes in addition fnma and fhlmc are exempt from sec filing requirements they file sec k and q reports but many other reports such as certain reports regarding their remic mortgage securities are not filed lastly money market funds have diversification requirements so that not more than  of assets may be from the same issuer that is a worstcase default would drop a fund not more than five percent however these rules do not apply to fannie and freddie it would not be unusual to find a fund that had the vast majority of its assets in fannie and freddie debtcitation needed in  the congressional budget office wrote there have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies but in the place of federal funds the government provides considerable unpriced benefits to the enterprises governmentsponsored enterprises are costly to the government and taxpayers the benefit is currently worth  billion annually

introduced the budget and accounting transparency act of  hr  th congress into the united states house of representatives during the th united states congress the bill if it were passed would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs such as fannie mae and freddie mac the bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fairvalue basis using guidelines set forth by the financial accounting standards board the changes made by the bill would mean that fannie mae and freddie mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt these programs themselves would not be changed but how they are accounted for in the united states federal budget would be the goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget  rulingedit on may   the wall street journal reported that a us district court judge said nomura holdings inc was not truthful in describing mortgagebacked securities sold to fannie mae and freddie mac giving a victory to the companies’ conservator the

conservatively measured is enormous” she wrote during the boom fannie and freddie invested billions of dollars in mortgagebacked securities issued by such companies as nomura those investments bolstered profits but in the bust contributed to steep losses that ultimately resulted in the companies’  government takeover nomura and rbs were two of  financial institutions including bank of

external links historyedit a view from the southwest of the federal national mortgage associations fannie maes reston virginia facility the great depression wrought havoc on the us housing market by  an estimated  to  of the nations outstanding mortgage debt was in default fannie mae was established in  by amendments to the national housing act as part of franklin delano roosevelts new deal originally chartered as the national mortgage association of washington the organizations explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home mortgages in an attempt to raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing fannie mae created a liquid secondary mortgage market and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans primarily by buying federal housing administration fha insured mortgages for the first thirty years following its inception fannie mae held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market other considerations may have motivated the new deal focus on the housing market about a third of the nations unemployed were in the building trade and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build fannie mae was acquired by the housing and home finance agency from the federal loan agency as a constituent unit in  in  an amendment known as the federal national mortgage association charter act made fannie mae into mixedownership corporation meaning that federal government held the preferred stock while private investors held the common stock in  it converted to a privately held corporation to remove its activity and debt from the federal budget in the  change arising from the housing and urban development act of  fannie maes predecessor also called fannie mae was split into the current fannie mae and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae ginnie mae which remained a government organization supports fhainsured mortgages as well as veterans administration va and farmers home administration fmha insured mortgages as such ginnie mae is the only homeloan agency explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government in  the federal government authorized fannie mae to purchase conventional mortgages the same year it went public on new york and pacific exchanges residential mortgage loan origination nd edition pg jkeith baker  ie those not insured by the fha va or fmha and created the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc colloquially known as freddie mac to compete with fannie mae and thus facilitate a more robust and efficient secondary mortgage market in  fannie mae issued its first mortgage passthrough and called it a mortgagebacked security the fannie mae laws did not require the banks to hand out subprime loans in any way ginnie mae had guaranteed the first mortgage passthrough security of an approved lender in  and in  freddie mac issued its first mortgage passthrough called a participation certificate composed primarily of private mortgages sedit in  president george hw bush signed the housing and community development act of  the act amended the charter of fannie mae and freddie mac to reflect the democratic congress view that the gses have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low and moderateincome families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return for the first time the gses were required to meet affordable housing goals set annually by the department of housing and urban development hud and approved by congress the initial annual goal for lowincome and moderateincome mortgage purchases for each gse was  of the total number of dwelling units financed by mortgage purchases and increased to  by  in  fannie mae came under pressure from the clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income borrowers by increasing the ratios of their loan portfolios in distressed inner city areas designated in the community reinvestment act cra of  additionally community reinvestment act regulators under the direction of hud secretary andrew cuomo gave higher ratings to banks that financed home loans to creditdeprived areas in essence banks were rewarded for bypassing loan standards and instead approving loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting if banks did not adhere to these rules then the cra watchdogs limited their ability to lend  in  the new york times reported that with the corporations move towards the subprime market fannie mae is taking on significantly more risk which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times but the governmentsubsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the s sedit franklin raines earned  million in salary and bonuses while he was head of fannie mae in  because of a reassessment of the housing market by hud antipredatory lending rules were put into place that disallowed risky highcost loans from being credited toward affordable housing goals in  these rules were dropped and highrisk loans were again counted toward affordable housing goals the intent was that fannie maes enforcement of the underwriting standards they maintained for standard conforming mortgages would also provide safe and stable means of lending to buyers who did not have prime credit as daniel mudd then president and ceo of fannie mae testified in  instead the agencys underwriting requirements drove business into the arms of the private mortgage industry who marketed aggressive products without regard to future consequences we also set conservative underwriting standards for loans we finance to ensure the homebuyers can afford their loans over the long term we sought to bring the standards we apply to the prime space to the subprime market with our industry partners primarily to expand our services to underserved families unfortunately fannie maequality safe loans in the subprime market did not become the standard and the lending market moved away from us borrowers were offered a range of loans that layered teaser rates interestonly negative amortization and payment options and lowdocumentation requirements on top of floatingrate loans in early  we began sounding our concerns about this layeredrisk lending for example tom lund the head of our singlefamily mortgage business publicly stated one of the things we dont feel good about right now as we look into this marketplace is more homebuyers being put into programs that have more risk those products are for more sophisticated buyers does it make sense for borrowers to take on risk they may not be aware of are we setting them up for failure as a result we gave up significant market share to our competitors alex berenson of the new york times reported in  that fannie maes risk is much larger than is commonly held nassim taleb wrote in the black swan the governmentsponsored institution fannie mae when i look at its risks seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite vulnerable to the slightest hiccup but not to worry their large staff of scientists deem these events unlikely on january   the federal housing enterprise regulatory reform act of  s was first introduced in the senate by sen chuck hagel the senate legislation was an effort to reform the existing gse regulatory structure in light of the recent accounting problems and questionable management actions leading to considerable income restatements by the gses after being reported favorably by the senates committee on banking housing and urban affairs in july  the bill was never considered by the full senate for a vote sen john mccains decision to become a cosponsor of s almost a year later in  was the last action taken regarding sen hagels bill in spite of developments since clearing the senate committee sen mccain pointed out that fannie maes regulator reported that profits were illusions deliberately and systematically created by the companys senior management in his floor statement giving support to s at the same time the house also introduced similar legislation the federal housing finance reform act of  hr  in the spring of  the house financial services committee had crafted changes and produced a committee report by july  to the legislation it was passed by the house in october in spite of president bushs statement of policy opposed to the house version which stated the regulatory regime envisioned by hr  is considerably weaker than that which governs other large complex financial institutions the legislation met with opposition from both democrats and republicans at that point and the senate never took up the house passed version for consideration after that the mortgage crisis from late edit following their mission to meet federal housing and urban development hud housing goals gses such as fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks fhlbanks had striven to improve home ownership of low and middle income families underserved areas and generally through special affordable methods such as the ability to obtain a year fixedrate mortgage with a low down payment and the continuous availability of mortgage credit under a wide range of economic conditions then in – the subprime mortgage crisis began the market shifted away from regulated gses and radically toward mortgage backed securities mbs issued by unregulated privatelabel securitization conduits typically operated by investment banks as mortgage originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label mbss gses lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators competition between the gses and private securitizers for loans further undermined gses power and strengthened mortgage originators this contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis investment bank securitizers were more willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk whereas the gses guaranteed the performance of their mbss private securitizers generally did not and might only retain a thin slice of risk often banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through credit default swaps making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern the shift toward riskier mortgages and private label mbs distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels that had been elevated during – by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates earnings depended on volume so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the gses would not initially securitize thus the shift away from gse securitization to privatelabel securitization pls also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type from traditional amortizing fixedrate mortgages frms to nontraditional structurally riskier nonamortizing adjustablerate mortgages arms and in the start of a sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards the growth of pls however forced the gses to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders shareholder pressure pushed the gses into competition with pls for market share and the gses loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete in contrast the wholly public fhaginnie mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share the growth of privatelabel securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led in  to an increasing number of borrowers often with poor credit who were unable to pay their mortgages – particularly with adjustable rate mortgages arm caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures as a result home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages this depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the gses which back the majority of us mortgages in july  the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that fannie mae and freddie mac play a central role in the us housing finance system the us treasury department and the federal reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations including granting both corporations access to federal reserve lowinterest loans at similar rates as commercial banks and removing the prohibition on the treasury department to purchase the gses stock despite these efforts by august  shares of both fannie mae and freddie mac had tumbled more than  from their oneyear prior levels on oct   fhfa estimates revealed that the bailout of freddie mac and fannie mae will likely cost taxpayers – billion in total with over  billion already provided  – crisis and conservatorshipedit main article federal takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac on july   the new york times reported that us government officials were considering a plan for the us government to take over fannie mae andor freddie mac should their financial situations worsen due to the us housing crisis fannie mae and smaller freddie mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the united states and so were especially hard hit by the slump the government officials also stated that the government had also considered calling for explicit government guarantee through legislation of  trillion on debt owned or guaranteed by the two companies fannie stock plunged some worried that fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt others worried about a government seizure us treasury secretary henry m paulson as well as the white house went on the air to defend the financial soundness of fannie mae in a lastditch effort to prevent a total financial panic fannie and freddie underpinned the whole us mortgage market as recently as  fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac had owned or guaranteed about half of the uss  trillion mortgage market if they were to collapse mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive fannie and freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the chinese government to money market funds to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people if they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale the administration pr effort was not enough by itself to save the gses their government directive to purchase bad loans from private banks in order to prevent these banks from failing as well as the  top banks falsely classifying loans as aaa caused instability paulsons plan was to go in swiftly and seize the two gses rather than provide loans as he did for aig and the major banks he told president bush that the first sound they hear will be their heads hitting the floor in a reference to the french revolution the major banks have since been sued by the feds for a sum of  and some of the major banks have already settled in addition a lawsuit has been filed against the federal government by the shareholders of fannie mae and freddie mac for a creating an environment by which fannie and freddie would be unable to meet their financial obligations b forcing the executive management to sign over the companies to the conservator by a and c the gross violation of the fifth amendment taking clause on september   james lockhart director of the federal housing finance agency fhfa announced that fannie mae and freddie mac were being placed into conservatorship of the fhfa the action was one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades lockhart also dismissed the firms chief executive officers and boards of directors and caused the issuance to the treasury new senior preferred stock and common stock warrants amounting to  of each gse the value of the common stock and preferred stock to preconservatorship holders was greatly diminished by the suspension of future dividends on previously outstanding stock in the effort to maintain the value of company debt and of mortgagebacked securities fhfa stated that there are no plans to liquidate the company the authority of the us treasury to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing fannie mae or freddie mac is limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to the july   law enabling expanded regulatory authority over fannie mae and freddie mac increased the national debt ceiling us billion to a total of us trillion in anticipation of the potential need for the treasury to have the flexibility to support the federal home loan banks  – delistingedit on june   fannie mae and freddie mac announced their stocks would be delisted from the nyse the federal housing finance agency directed the delisting after fannies stock traded below  a share for over  days since then the stocks have continued to trade on the overthecounter bulletin board  –  billion dividendedit in may  fannie mae announced that it is going to pay a dividend of  billion to the united states treasury  –  billion dividend paidedit  billion received from treasury  billion paid to treasury fannie mae  financial results enabled them to pay  billion in dividends to treasury for the year resulting in a cumulative total of  billion in dividends through december   – approximately  billion more than fannie mae received in support as of march   fannie mae expects to have paid a total of  billion in payments to treasury businessedit fannie mae makes money partly by borrowing at low rates and then reinvesting its borrowings into whole mortgages and mortgage backed securities it borrows in the debt markets by selling bonds and provides liquidity to mortgage originators by purchasing whole loans it purchases whole loans and then securitizes them for the investment market by creating mbs that are either retained or sold as a government sponsored enterprise or gse fannie mae is compelled by law to provide liquidity to mortgage originators in all economic conditions it must legally ignore adverse market conditions which appear to be unprofitable if there are loans available for purchase that meet its predetermined underwriting standards it must purchase them if no other buyers are available due to the size scale and scope of the united states singlefamily residential and commercial residential markets market participants viewed fannie mae corporate debt as having a very high probability of being repaid fannie mae is able to borrow very inexpensively in the debt markets as a consequence of market perception there usually exists a large difference between the rate it can borrow at and the rate it can lend at this was called the big fat gap by alan greenspan by august  fannie maes mortgage portfolio was in excess of  billion fannie mae also earns a significant portion of its income from guaranty fees it receives as compensation for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying its singlefamily fannie mae mbs and on the singlefamily mortgage loans held in its retained portfolio investors or purchasers of fannie mae mbss are willing to let fannie mae keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk that is fannie maes guarantee that the scheduled principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid even if the borrower defaults fannie maes charter has historically prevented it from guaranteeing mortgages with a loantovalues over  without mortgage insurance or a repurchase agreement with the lender however in  and  fannie mae did purchase subprime and alta loans as investments business mechanismedit fannie mae is a purchaser of mortgages which it packages into mbs fannie mae buys loans from approved mortgage sellers and securitizes them it then sells the resultant mortgagebacked security to investors in the secondary mortgage market along with a guarantee that the stated principal and interest payments will be timely passed through to the investorcitation needed in addition fannie mbs like those of fannie mae mbs and ginnie mae mbs are eligible to be traded in the tobeannounced or tba market by purchasing the mortgages fannie mae and freddie mac provide banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new loans this gives the united states housing and credit markets flexibility and liquidity in order for fannie mae to provide its guarantee to mortgagebacked securities it issues it sets the guidelines for the loans that it will accept for purchase called conforming loans fannie mae produced an automated underwriting system aus tool called desktop underwriter du which lenders can use to automatically determine if a loan is conforming fannie mae followed this program up in  with custom du which allows lenders to set custom underwriting rules to handle nonconforming loans as well the secondary market for nonconforming loans includes jumbo loans which are mortgages larger than the maximum mortgage that fannie mae and freddie mac will purchase in early  the decision was made to allow tba tobeannouncedeligible mortgagebacked securities to include up to  jumbo mortgages conforming loansedit fannie mae and freddie mac have a limit on the maximum sized loan they will guarantee this is known as the conforming loan limit the conforming loan limit for fannie mae along with freddie mac is set by office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo the regulator of both gses ofheo annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan based on the october to october changes in mean home price above which a mortgage is considered a nonconforming jumbo loan the conforming loan limit is  percent higher in alaska and hawaii the gses only buy loans that are conforming to repackage into the secondary market lowering the demand for nonconforming loans by virtue of the law of supply and demand then it is harder for lenders to sell these loans in the secondary market thus these types of loans tend to cost more to borrowers typically  to  of a percent indeed in  since the demand for bonds not guaranteed by gses was almost nonexistent nonconforming loans were priced nearly  to  higher than conforming loans implicit guarantee and government supportedit originally fannie had an explicit guarantee from the government if it got in trouble the government promised to bail it out this changed in  ginnie mae was split off from fannie ginnie retained the explicit guarantee fannie however became a private corporation chartered by congress and with a direct line of credit to the us treasury it was its nature as a government sponsored enterprise gse that provided the implied guarantee for their borrowing the charter also limited their business activity to the mortgage market in this regard although they were a private company they could not operate like a regular private company fannie mae received no direct government funding or backing fannie mae securities carried no actual explicit government guarantee of being repaid this was clearly stated in the law that authorizes gses on the securities themselves and in many public communications issued by fannie maecitation needed neither the certificates nor payments of principal and interest on the certificates were explicitly guaranteed by the united states government the certificates did not legally constitute a debt or obligation of the united states or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than fannie mae during the subprime era every fannie mae prospectus read in bold allcaps letters the certificates and payments of principal and interest on the certificates are not guaranteed by the united states and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the united states or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than fannie mae verbiage changed from allcaps to standard case for readabilitycitation needed however the implied guarantee as well as various special treatments given to fannie by the government greatly enhanced its success for example the implied guarantee allowed fannie mae and freddie mac to save billions in borrowing costs as their credit rating was very good estimates by the congressional budget office and the treasury department put the figure at about  billion per year vernon l smith  nobel laureate in economics has called fhlmc and fnma implicitly taxpayerbacked agencies the economist has referred to the implicit government guarantee of fhlmc and fnma in testimony before the house and senate banking committee in  alan greenspan expressed the belief that fannie maes weak financial position was the result of markets believing that the us government would never allow fannie mae or freddie mac to fail fannie mae and freddie mac were allowed to hold less capital than normal financial institutions eg they were allowed to sell mortgagebacked securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions regulations exist through the fdic bank holding company act that govern the solvency of financial institutions the regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capitalasset ratio greater than or equal to  the gses fannie mae and freddie mac are exempt from this capitalasset ratio requirement and can and often do maintain a capitalasset ratio less than  the additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times but put the companies at greater risk in bad times such as during the subprime mortgage crisis fnma is not exempt from state and local taxes in addition fnma and fhlmc are exempt from sec filing requirements they file sec k and q reports but many other reports such as certain reports regarding their remic mortgage securities are not filed lastly money market funds have diversification requirements so that not more than  of assets may be from the same issuer that is a worstcase default would drop a fund not more than five percent however these rules do not apply to fannie and freddie it would not be unusual to find a fund that had the vast majority of its assets in fannie and freddie debtcitation needed in  the congressional budget office wrote there have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies but in the place of federal funds the government provides considerable unpriced benefits to the enterprises governmentsponsored enterprises are costly to the government and taxpayers the benefit is currently worth  billion annually accountingedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve

accounting errors fannie mae was expected to spend more than  billion in  alone to complete its internal audit and bring it closer to compliance the necessary restatement was expected to cost  billion but was completed at a total cost of  billion in restated earnings as listed in fannie maes annual report on form k concerns with business and accounting practices at fannie mae predate the scandal itself on june   the house banking subcommittee on capital markets securities and governmentsponsored enterprises held hearings on fannie mae on december   us regulators filed  civil charges against chief executive franklin raines chief financial officer j timothy howard and the former controller leanne g spencer the three were accused of manipulating fannie mae earnings to maximize their bonuses

standards board the changes made by the bill would mean that fannie mae and freddie mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs

federal national mortgage associations fannie maes reston virginia facility the great depression wrought havoc on the us housing market by  an estimated  to  of the nations outstanding mortgage debt was in default fannie mae was established in  by amendments to the national housing act as part of franklin delano roosevelts new deal originally chartered as the national mortgage association of washington the organizations explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home mortgages in an attempt to raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing fannie mae created a liquid secondary mortgage market and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans primarily by buying federal housing administration fha insured mortgages for the first thirty years following its inception fannie mae held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market other considerations may have motivated the new deal focus on the housing market about a third of the nations unemployed were in the building trade and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build fannie mae was acquired by the housing and home finance agency from the federal loan agency as a constituent unit in  in  an amendment known as the federal national mortgage association charter act made fannie mae into mixedownership corporation meaning that federal government held the preferred stock while private investors held the common stock in  it converted to a privately held corporation to remove its activity and debt from the federal budget in the  change arising from the housing and urban development act of  fannie maes predecessor also called fannie mae was split into the current fannie mae and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae ginnie mae which remained a government organization supports fhainsured mortgages as well as veterans administration va and farmers home administration fmha insured mortgages as such ginnie mae is the only homeloan agency explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government in  the federal government authorized fannie mae to purchase conventional mortgages the same year it went public on new york and pacific exchanges residential mortgage loan origination nd edition pg jkeith baker  ie those not insured by the fha va or fmha and created the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc colloquially known as freddie mac to compete with fannie mae and thus facilitate a more robust and efficient secondary mortgage market in  fannie mae issued its first mortgage passthrough and called it a mortgagebacked security the fannie mae laws did not require the banks to hand out subprime loans in any way ginnie mae had guaranteed the first mortgage passthrough security of an approved lender in  and in  freddie mac issued its first mortgage passthrough called a participation certificate composed primarily of private mortgages sedit in  president george hw bush signed the housing and community development act of  the act amended the charter of fannie mae and freddie mac to reflect the democratic congress view that the gses have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low and moderateincome families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return for the first time the gses were required to meet affordable housing goals set annually by the department of housing and urban development hud and approved by congress the initial annual goal for lowincome and moderateincome mortgage purchases for each gse was  of the total number of dwelling units financed by mortgage purchases and increased to  by  in  fannie mae came under pressure from the clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income borrowers by increasing the ratios of their loan portfolios in distressed inner city areas designated in the community reinvestment act cra of  additionally community reinvestment act regulators under the direction of hud secretary andrew cuomo gave higher ratings to banks that financed home loans to creditdeprived areas in essence banks were rewarded for bypassing loan standards and instead approving loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting if banks did not adhere to these rules then the cra watchdogs limited their ability to lend  in  the new york times reported that with the corporations move towards the subprime market fannie mae is taking on significantly more risk which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times but the governmentsubsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the s sedit franklin raines earned  million in salary and bonuses while he was head of fannie mae in  because of a reassessment of the housing market by hud antipredatory lending rules were put into place that disallowed risky highcost loans from being credited toward affordable housing goals in  these rules were dropped and highrisk loans were again counted toward affordable housing goals the intent was that fannie maes enforcement of the underwriting standards they maintained for standard conforming mortgages would also provide safe and stable means of lending to buyers who did not have prime credit as daniel mudd then president and ceo of fannie mae testified in  instead the agencys underwriting requirements drove business into the arms of the private mortgage industry who marketed aggressive products without regard to future consequences we also set conservative underwriting standards for loans we finance to ensure the homebuyers can afford their loans over the long term we sought to bring the standards we apply to the prime space to the subprime market with our industry partners primarily to expand our services to underserved families unfortunately fannie maequality safe loans in the subprime market did not become the standard and the lending market moved away from us borrowers were offered a range of loans that layered teaser rates interestonly negative amortization and payment options and lowdocumentation requirements on top of floatingrate loans in early  we began sounding our concerns about this layeredrisk lending for example tom lund the head of our singlefamily mortgage business publicly stated one of the things we dont feel good about right now as we look into this marketplace is more homebuyers being put into programs that have more risk those products are for more sophisticated buyers does it make sense for borrowers to take on risk they may not be aware of are we setting them up for failure as a result we gave up significant market share to our competitors alex berenson of the new york times reported in  that fannie maes risk is much larger than is commonly held nassim taleb wrote in the black swan the governmentsponsored institution fannie mae when i look at its risks seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite vulnerable to the slightest hiccup but not to worry their large staff of scientists deem these events unlikely on january   the federal housing enterprise regulatory reform act of  s was first introduced in the senate by sen chuck hagel the senate legislation was an effort to reform the existing gse regulatory structure in light of the recent accounting problems and questionable management actions leading to considerable income restatements by the gses after being reported favorably by the senates committee on banking housing and urban affairs in july  the bill was never considered by the full senate for a vote sen john mccains decision to become a cosponsor of s almost a year later in  was the last action taken regarding sen hagels bill in spite of developments since clearing the senate committee sen mccain pointed out that fannie maes regulator reported that profits were illusions deliberately and systematically created by the companys senior management in his floor statement giving support to s at the same time the house also introduced similar legislation the federal housing finance reform act of  hr  in the spring of  the house financial services committee had crafted changes and produced a committee report by july  to the legislation it was passed by the house in october in spite of president bushs statement of policy opposed to the house version which stated the regulatory regime envisioned by hr  is considerably weaker than that which governs other large complex financial institutions the legislation met with opposition from both democrats and republicans at that point and the senate never took up the house passed version for consideration after that the mortgage crisis from late edit following their mission to meet federal housing and urban development hud housing goals gses such as fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks fhlbanks had striven to improve home ownership of low and middle income families underserved areas and generally through special affordable methods such as the ability to obtain a year fixedrate mortgage with a low down payment and the continuous availability of mortgage credit under a wide range of economic conditions then in – the subprime mortgage crisis began the market shifted away from regulated gses and radically toward mortgage backed securities mbs issued by unregulated privatelabel securitization conduits typically operated by investment banks as mortgage originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label mbss gses lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators competition between the gses and private securitizers for loans further undermined gses power and strengthened mortgage originators this contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis investment bank securitizers were more willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk whereas the gses guaranteed the performance of their mbss private securitizers generally did not and might only retain a thin slice of risk often banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through credit default swaps making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern the shift toward riskier mortgages and private label mbs distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels that had been elevated during – by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates earnings depended on volume so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the gses would not initially securitize thus the shift away from gse securitization to privatelabel securitization pls also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type from traditional amortizing fixedrate mortgages frms to nontraditional structurally riskier nonamortizing adjustablerate mortgages arms and in the start of a sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards the growth of pls however forced the gses to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders shareholder pressure pushed the gses into competition with pls for market share and the gses loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete in contrast the wholly public fhaginnie mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share the growth of privatelabel securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led in  to an increasing number of borrowers often with poor credit who were unable to pay their mortgages – particularly with adjustable rate mortgages arm caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures as a result home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages this depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the gses which back the majority of us mortgages in july  the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that fannie mae and freddie mac play a central role in the us housing finance system the us treasury department and the federal reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations including granting both corporations access to federal reserve lowinterest loans at similar rates as commercial banks and removing the prohibition on the treasury department to purchase the gses stock despite these efforts by august  shares of both fannie mae and freddie mac had tumbled more than  from their oneyear prior levels on oct   fhfa estimates revealed that the bailout of freddie mac and fannie mae will likely cost taxpayers – billion in total with over  billion already provided  – crisis and conservatorshipedit main article federal takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac on july   the new york times reported that us government officials were considering a plan for the us government to take over fannie mae andor freddie mac should their financial situations worsen due to the us housing crisis fannie mae and smaller freddie mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the united states and so were especially hard hit by the slump the government officials also stated that the government had also considered calling for explicit government guarantee through legislation of  trillion on debt owned or guaranteed by the two companies fannie stock plunged some worried that fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt others worried about a government seizure us treasury secretary henry m paulson as well as the white house went on the air to defend the financial soundness of fannie mae in a lastditch effort to prevent a total financial panic fannie and freddie underpinned the whole us mortgage market as recently as  fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac had owned or guaranteed about half of the uss  trillion mortgage market if they were to collapse mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive fannie and freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the chinese government to money market funds to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people if they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale the administration pr effort was not enough by itself to save the gses their government directive to purchase bad loans from private banks in order to prevent these banks from failing as well as the  top banks falsely classifying loans as aaa caused instability paulsons plan was to go in swiftly and seize the two gses rather than provide loans as he did for aig and the major banks he told president bush that the first sound they hear will be their heads hitting the floor in a reference to the french revolution the major banks have since been sued by the feds for a sum of  and some of the major banks have already settled in addition a lawsuit has been filed against the federal government by the shareholders of fannie mae and freddie mac for a creating an environment by which fannie and freddie would be unable to meet their financial obligations b forcing the executive management to sign over the companies to the conservator by a and c the gross violation of the fifth amendment taking clause on september   james lockhart director of the federal housing finance agency fhfa announced that fannie mae and freddie mac were being placed into conservatorship of the fhfa the action was one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades lockhart also dismissed the firms chief executive officers and boards of directors and caused the issuance to the treasury new senior preferred stock and common stock warrants amounting to  of each gse the value of the common stock and preferred stock to preconservatorship holders was greatly diminished by the suspension of future dividends on previously outstanding stock in the effort to maintain the value of company debt and of mortgagebacked securities fhfa stated that there are no plans to liquidate the company the authority of the us treasury to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing fannie mae or freddie mac is limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to the july   law enabling expanded regulatory authority over fannie mae and freddie mac increased the national debt

cumulative total of  billion in dividends through december   – approximately  billion more than fannie mae received in support as of march   fannie mae expects to have paid a total of  billion in payments to treasury businessedit fannie mae makes money partly by borrowing at low rates and then reinvesting its borrowings into whole mortgages and mortgage backed securities it borrows in the debt markets by selling bonds and provides liquidity to mortgage originators by purchasing whole loans it purchases whole loans and then securitizes them for the investment market by creating mbs that are either retained or sold as a government sponsored enterprise or gse fannie mae is compelled by law to provide liquidity to mortgage originators in all economic conditions it must legally ignore adverse market conditions which appear to be unprofitable if there are loans available for purchase that meet its predetermined underwriting standards it must purchase them if no other buyers are available due to the size scale and scope of the united states singlefamily residential and commercial residential markets market participants viewed fannie mae corporate debt as having a very high probability of being repaid fannie mae is able to borrow very inexpensively in the debt markets as a consequence of market perception there usually exists a large difference between the rate it can borrow at and the rate it can lend at this was called the big fat gap by alan greenspan by august  fannie maes mortgage portfolio was in excess of  billion fannie mae also earns a significant portion of its income from guaranty fees it receives as compensation for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying its singlefamily fannie mae mbs and on the singlefamily mortgage loans held in its retained portfolio investors or purchasers of fannie mae mbss are willing to let fannie mae keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk that is fannie maes guarantee that the scheduled principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid even if the borrower defaults fannie maes charter has historically prevented it from guaranteeing mortgages with a loantovalues over  without mortgage insurance or a repurchase agreement with the lender however in  and  fannie mae did purchase subprime and alta loans as investments business mechanismedit fannie mae is a purchaser of mortgages which it packages into mbs fannie mae buys loans from approved mortgage sellers and securitizes them it then sells the resultant mortgagebacked security to investors in the secondary mortgage market along with a guarantee that the stated principal and interest payments will be timely passed through to the investorcitation needed in addition fannie mbs like those of fannie mae mbs and ginnie mae mbs are eligible to be traded in the tobeannounced or tba market by purchasing the mortgages fannie mae and freddie mac provide banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new loans this gives the united states housing and credit markets flexibility and liquidity in order for fannie mae to provide its guarantee to mortgagebacked securities it issues it sets the guidelines for the loans that it will accept for purchase called conforming loans fannie mae produced an automated underwriting system aus tool called desktop underwriter du which lenders can use to automatically determine if a loan is conforming fannie mae followed this program up in  with custom du which allows lenders to set custom underwriting rules to handle nonconforming loans as well the secondary market for nonconforming loans includes jumbo loans which are mortgages larger than the maximum mortgage that fannie mae and freddie mac will purchase in early  the decision was made to allow tba tobeannouncedeligible mortgagebacked securities to include up to  jumbo mortgages conforming loansedit fannie mae and freddie mac have a limit on the maximum sized loan they will guarantee this is known as the conforming loan limit the conforming loan limit for fannie mae along with freddie mac is set by office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo the regulator of both gses ofheo annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan based on the october to october changes in mean home price above which a mortgage is considered a nonconforming jumbo loan the conforming loan limit is  percent higher in alaska and hawaii the gses only buy loans that are conforming to repackage into the secondary market lowering the demand for nonconforming loans by virtue of the law of supply and demand then it is harder for lenders to sell these loans in the secondary market thus these types of loans tend to cost more to borrowers typically  to  of a percent indeed in  since the demand for bonds not guaranteed by gses was almost nonexistent nonconforming loans were priced nearly  to  higher than conforming loans implicit guarantee and government supportedit originally fannie had an explicit guarantee from the government if it got in trouble the government promised to bail it out this changed in  ginnie mae was split off from fannie ginnie retained the explicit guarantee fannie however became a private corporation chartered by congress and with a direct line of credit to the us treasury it was its nature as a government sponsored enterprise gse that provided the implied guarantee for their borrowing the charter also limited their business activity to the mortgage market in this regard although they were a private company they could not operate like a regular private company fannie mae received no direct government funding or backing fannie mae securities carried no actual explicit government guarantee of being repaid this was clearly stated in the law that authorizes gses on the securities themselves and in many public communications issued by fannie maecitation needed neither the certificates nor payments of principal and interest on the certificates were explicitly guaranteed by the united states government the certificates did not legally constitute a debt or obligation of the united states or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than fannie mae during the subprime era every fannie mae prospectus read in bold allcaps letters the certificates and payments of principal and interest on the certificates are not guaranteed by the united states and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the united states or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than fannie mae verbiage changed from allcaps to standard case for readabilitycitation needed however the implied guarantee as well as various special treatments given to fannie by the government greatly enhanced its success for example the implied guarantee allowed fannie mae and freddie mac to save billions in borrowing costs as their credit rating was very good estimates by the congressional budget office and the treasury department put the figure at about  billion per year vernon l smith  nobel laureate in economics has called fhlmc and fnma implicitly taxpayerbacked agencies the economist has referred to the implicit government guarantee of fhlmc and fnma in testimony before the house and senate banking committee in  alan greenspan expressed the belief that fannie maes weak financial position was the result of markets believing that the us government would never allow fannie mae or freddie mac to fail fannie mae and freddie mac were allowed to hold less capital than normal financial institutions eg they were allowed to sell mortgagebacked securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions regulations exist through the fdic bank holding company act that govern the solvency of financial institutions the regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capitalasset ratio greater than or equal to  the gses fannie mae and freddie mac are exempt from this capitalasset ratio requirement and can and often do maintain a capitalasset ratio less than  the additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times but put the companies at greater risk in bad times such as during the subprime mortgage crisis fnma is not exempt from state and local taxes in addition fnma and fhlmc are exempt from sec filing requirements they file sec k and q reports but many other reports such as certain reports regarding their remic mortgage securities are not filed lastly money market funds have diversification requirements so that not more than  of assets may be from the same issuer that is a worstcase default would drop a fund not more than five percent however these rules do not apply to fannie and freddie it would not be unusual to find a fund that had the vast majority of its assets in fannie and freddie debtcitation needed in  the congressional budget office wrote there have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies but in the place of federal funds the government provides considerable unpriced benefits to the enterprises governmentsponsored enterprises are costly to the government and taxpayers the benefit is currently worth  billion annually accountingedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced

for its accounting practices the office of federal housing enterprise oversight released a report on september   alleging widespread accounting errors fannie mae was expected to spend more than  billion in  alone to complete its internal audit and bring it closer to compliance the necessary restatement was expected to cost  billion but was completed at a total cost of  billion in restated earnings as listed in fannie maes annual report on form k concerns with business and accounting practices at fannie mae predate the scandal itself on june   the house banking subcommittee on capital markets securities and governmentsponsored enterprises held hearings on fannie mae on december   us regulators filed  civil charges against chief executive franklin raines chief financial officer j timothy howard and the former controller leanne g spencer the three were accused of manipulating fannie mae earnings to maximize their bonuses the lawsuit sought to recoup more than  million in bonus payments collectively accrued by the trio from  to  and about  million in penalties for their involvement in the accounting scandal after  years of litigation in  a summary judgment was issued

political loan scandal and angelo mozilo § friends of angelo foa vip program in june  the wall street journal reported that two former ceos of fannie mae james a johnson and franklin raines had received loans below market rate from countrywide financial fannie mae was the biggest buyer of countrywides mortgages the friends of angelo vip countrywide loan program included many people from

commission with securities fraud the sec alleges they knew and approved of misleading statements claiming the companies had minimal exposure to subprime loans at the height of home mortgage bubble former freddie chief financial officer anthony “buddy” piszel who in february  was cfo of corelogic had received a notice from the sec that the agency was considering taking action against him he then resigned from corelogic piszel was not among the executives charged in december  piszel had been succeeded at freddie by david kellermann kellermann committed suicide during his tenure at freddie a contemporaneous report on the sec charges continued the sec said mudd’s misconduct included knowingly giving false testimony to congress mudd said last week that the government approved fannie mae’s disclosures during his tenure “now it appears that the government has negotiated a deal to hold the government and governmentappointed executives who have signed the same disclosures since my departure blameless – so that it can sue individuals it fired years ago” he said in a statement last week  lawsuitsedit in  the agency had a number of other big banks in the crosshairs as well jpmorgan jpm was one of  financial institutions the fhfa sued back in  accusing them of selling fannie and freddie securities that had different and more risky characteristics than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales materials fannie and freddie the governmentbacked housing finance firms sustained massive losses on mortgagebacked securities as the housing market imploded requiring a bailout of over  billion the firms have been controlled by the fhfa since their  rescue swiss lender ubs has already reached an  million settlement with the fhfa in connection with losses fannie and freddie sustained on over  billion worth of mortgage securities the agency also settled for undisclosed sums earlier this year with citigroup c and general electric ge the fhfa is reportedly seeking  billion from jpmorgan to resolve its claims over  billion worth of securities sold to fannie and freddie by jpmorgan bear and wamu bank of america bac which acquired countrywide and merrill lynch during the crisis era could be on the hook for even more the charlottebased firm is facing claims from the fhfa over  billion worth of mortgage bonds in all the  fhfa lawsuits cover more than  billion in allegedly misrepresented securities the question of whether any individual bankers will be held to account is another matter thus far criminal cases related to the packaging and sale of mortgagebacked securities have been conspicuously absent the proposed jpmorgan settlement covers only civil charges and would not settle the question of whether any individual executives engaged in wrongdoing there is an ongoing federal criminal probe based in sacramento calif the state where washington mutual was based jpmorgan originally sought to be protected from any criminal charges as part of this deal but that request was rejected by the government  allegations of kickbacksedit on may   the los angeles times reported that a former foreclosure specialist at fannie mae has been charged but pleaded “not guilty to accepting a kickback from an arizona real estate broker in a santa ana federal court another lawsuit filed earlier in orange county superior court this one for wrongful termination has been filed against fannie mae by an employee who claims she was fired when she tried to alert management to kickbacks the employee claims that she started voicing her suspicions in  related legislationedit on may   representative scott garrett introduced the budget and accounting transparency act of  hr  th congress into the united states house of representatives during the th united states congress the bill if it were passed would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs such as fannie mae and freddie mac the bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fairvalue basis using guidelines set forth by the financial accounting standards board the changes made by the bill would mean that fannie mae and freddie mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt these programs themselves would not be changed but how they are accounted for in the united states federal budget would be the goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget  rulingedit on may   the wall street journal reported that a us district court judge said nomura holdings inc was not truthful in describing mortgagebacked securities sold to fannie mae and freddie mac giving a victory to the companies’ conservator the federal housing finance agency fhfa judge denise cote asked the fhfa to propose updated damages to be paid by nomura and codefendant rbs securities inc which underwrote some of the investments at the outset of the case the fhfa asked for about  billion the order brought to conclusion a rare trial addressing alleged mortgagerelated infractions committed during the housing boom over the past few years more than a dozen firms chose to settle similar allegations brought by the fhfa rather than face a court battle the settlements have brought fannie and freddie  billion in penalties in her decision judge cote wrote that nomura in offering documents for mortgagebacked securities sold to fannie and freddie didnt accurately describe the loans’ quality “the magnitude of falsity conservatively measured is enormous” she wrote during the boom fannie and freddie invested billions of dollars in mortgagebacked securities issued by such companies as nomura those investments bolstered profits but in the bust contributed to steep losses that ultimately resulted in the companies’  government takeover nomura and rbs were two of  financial institutions including bank of america corp and goldman sachs group inc targeted in  by the fhfa which alleged that the companies lied about the quality of the loans underlying the securities during the nonjury trial lawyers for the fhfa said that nomura and rbs inflated values of homes behind some mortgages and sometimes said a home was owneroccupied when it was

external links historyedit a view from the southwest of the federal national mortgage associations fannie maes reston virginia facility the great depression wrought havoc on the us housing market by  an estimated  to  of the nations outstanding mortgage debt was in default fannie mae was established in  by amendments to the national housing act as part of franklin delano roosevelts new deal originally chartered as the national mortgage association of washington the organizations explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home mortgages in an attempt to raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing fannie mae created a liquid secondary mortgage market and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans primarily by buying federal housing administration fha insured mortgages for the first thirty years following its inception fannie mae held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market other considerations may have motivated the new deal focus on the housing market about a third of the nations unemployed were in the building trade and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build fannie mae was acquired by the housing and home finance agency from the federal loan agency as a constituent unit in  in  an amendment known as the federal national mortgage association charter act made fannie mae into mixedownership corporation meaning that federal government held the preferred stock while private investors held the common stock in  it converted to a privately held corporation to remove its activity and debt from the federal budget in the  change arising from the housing and urban development act of  fannie maes predecessor also called fannie mae was split into the current fannie mae and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae ginnie mae which remained a government organization supports fhainsured mortgages as well as veterans administration va and farmers home administration fmha insured mortgages as such ginnie mae is the only homeloan agency explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government in  the federal government authorized fannie mae to purchase conventional mortgages the same year it went public on new york and pacific exchanges residential mortgage loan origination nd edition pg jkeith baker  ie those not insured by the fha va or fmha and created the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc colloquially known as freddie mac to compete with fannie mae and thus facilitate a more robust and efficient secondary mortgage market in  fannie mae issued its first mortgage passthrough and called it a mortgagebacked security the fannie mae laws did not require the banks to hand out subprime loans in any way ginnie mae had guaranteed the first mortgage passthrough security of an approved lender in  and in  freddie mac issued its first mortgage passthrough called a participation certificate composed primarily of private mortgages sedit in  president george hw bush signed the housing and community development act of  the act amended the charter of fannie mae and freddie mac to reflect the democratic congress view that the gses have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low and moderateincome families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return for the first time the gses were required to meet affordable housing goals set annually by the department of housing and urban development hud and approved by congress the initial annual goal for lowincome and moderateincome mortgage purchases for each gse was  of the total number of dwelling units financed by mortgage purchases and increased to  by  in  fannie mae came under pressure from the clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income borrowers by increasing the ratios of their loan portfolios in distressed inner city areas designated in the community reinvestment act cra of  additionally community reinvestment act regulators under the direction of hud secretary andrew cuomo gave higher ratings to banks that financed home loans to creditdeprived areas in essence banks were rewarded for bypassing loan standards and instead approving loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting if banks did not adhere to these rules then the cra watchdogs limited their ability to lend  in  the new york times reported that with the corporations move towards the subprime market fannie mae is taking on significantly more risk which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times but the governmentsubsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the s sedit franklin raines earned  million in salary and bonuses while he was head of fannie mae in  because of a reassessment of the housing market by hud antipredatory lending rules were put into place that disallowed risky highcost loans from being credited toward affordable housing goals in  these rules were dropped and highrisk loans were again counted toward affordable housing goals the intent was that fannie maes enforcement of the underwriting standards they maintained for standard conforming mortgages would also provide safe and stable means of lending to buyers who did not have prime credit as daniel mudd then president and ceo of fannie mae testified in  instead the agencys underwriting requirements drove business into the arms of the private mortgage industry who marketed aggressive products without regard to future consequences we also set conservative underwriting standards for loans we finance to ensure the homebuyers can afford their loans over the long term we sought to bring the standards we apply to the prime space to the subprime market with our industry partners primarily to expand our services to underserved families unfortunately fannie maequality safe loans in the subprime market did not become the standard and the lending market moved away from us borrowers were offered a range of loans that layered teaser rates interestonly negative amortization and payment options and lowdocumentation requirements on top of floatingrate loans in early  we began sounding our concerns about this layeredrisk lending for example tom lund the head of our singlefamily mortgage business publicly stated one of the things we dont feel good about right now as we look into this marketplace is more homebuyers being put into programs that have more risk those products are for more sophisticated buyers does it make sense for borrowers to take on risk they may not be aware of are we setting them up for failure as a result we gave up significant market share to our competitors alex berenson of the new york times reported in  that fannie maes risk is much larger than is commonly held nassim taleb wrote in the black swan the governmentsponsored institution fannie mae when i look at its risks seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite vulnerable to the slightest hiccup but not to worry their large staff of scientists deem these events unlikely on january   the federal housing enterprise regulatory reform act of  s was first introduced in the senate by sen chuck hagel the senate legislation was an effort to reform the existing gse regulatory structure in light of the recent accounting problems and questionable management actions leading to considerable income restatements by the gses after being reported favorably by the senates committee on banking housing and urban affairs in july  the bill was never considered by the full senate for a vote sen john mccains decision to become a cosponsor of s almost a year later in  was the last action taken regarding sen hagels bill in spite of developments since clearing the senate committee sen mccain pointed out that fannie maes regulator reported that profits were illusions deliberately and systematically created by the companys senior management in his floor statement giving support to s at the same time the house also introduced similar legislation the federal housing finance reform act of  hr  in the spring of  the house financial services committee had crafted changes and produced a committee report by july  to the legislation it was passed by the house in october in spite of president bushs statement of policy opposed to the house version which stated the regulatory regime envisioned by hr  is considerably weaker than that which governs other large complex financial institutions the legislation met with opposition from both democrats and republicans at that point and the senate never took up the house passed version for consideration after that the mortgage crisis from late edit following their mission to meet federal housing and urban development hud housing goals gses such as fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks fhlbanks had striven to improve home ownership of low and middle income families underserved areas and generally through special affordable methods such as the ability to obtain a year fixedrate mortgage with a low down payment and the continuous availability of mortgage credit under a wide range of economic conditions then in – the subprime mortgage crisis began the market shifted away from regulated gses and radically toward mortgage backed securities mbs issued by unregulated privatelabel securitization conduits typically operated by investment banks as mortgage originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label mbss gses lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators competition between the gses and private securitizers for loans further undermined gses power and strengthened mortgage originators this contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis investment bank securitizers were more willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk whereas the gses guaranteed the performance of their mbss private securitizers generally did not and might only retain a thin slice of risk often banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through credit default swaps making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern the shift toward riskier mortgages and private label mbs distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels that had been elevated during – by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates earnings depended on volume so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the gses would not initially securitize thus the shift away from gse securitization to privatelabel securitization pls also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type from traditional amortizing fixedrate mortgages frms to nontraditional structurally riskier nonamortizing adjustablerate mortgages arms and in the start of a sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards the growth of pls however forced the gses to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders shareholder pressure pushed the gses into competition with pls for market share and the gses loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete in contrast the wholly public fhaginnie mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share the growth of privatelabel securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led in  to an increasing number of borrowers often with poor credit who were unable to pay their mortgages – particularly with adjustable rate mortgages arm caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures as a result home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages this depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the gses which back the majority of us mortgages in july  the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that fannie mae and freddie mac play a central role in the us housing finance system the us treasury department and the federal reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations including granting both corporations access to federal reserve lowinterest loans at similar rates as commercial banks and removing the prohibition on the treasury department to purchase the gses stock despite these efforts by august  shares of both fannie mae and freddie mac had tumbled more than  from their oneyear prior levels on oct   fhfa estimates revealed that the bailout of freddie mac and fannie mae will likely cost taxpayers – billion in total with over  billion already provided  – crisis and conservatorshipedit main article federal takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac on july   the new york times reported that us government officials were considering a plan for the us government to take over fannie mae andor freddie mac should their financial situations worsen due to the us housing crisis fannie mae and smaller freddie mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the united states and so were especially hard hit by the slump the government officials also stated that the government had also considered calling for explicit government guarantee through legislation of  trillion on debt owned or guaranteed by the two companies fannie stock plunged some worried that fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt others worried about a government seizure us treasury secretary henry m paulson as well as the white house went on the air to defend the financial soundness of fannie mae in a lastditch effort to prevent a total financial panic fannie and freddie underpinned the whole us mortgage market as recently as  fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac had owned or guaranteed about half of the uss  trillion mortgage market if they were to collapse mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive fannie and freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the chinese government to money market funds to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people if they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale the administration pr effort was not enough by itself to save the gses their government directive to purchase bad loans from private banks in order to prevent these banks from failing as well as the  top banks falsely classifying loans as aaa caused instability paulsons plan was to go in swiftly and seize the two gses rather than provide loans as he did for aig and the major banks he told president bush that the first sound they hear will be their heads hitting the floor in a reference to the french revolution the major banks have since been sued by the feds for a sum of  and some of the major banks have already settled in addition a lawsuit has been filed against the federal government by the shareholders of fannie mae and freddie mac for a creating an environment by which fannie and freddie would be unable to meet their financial obligations b forcing the executive management to sign over the companies to the conservator by a and c the gross violation of the fifth amendment taking clause on september   james lockhart director of the federal housing finance agency fhfa announced that fannie mae and freddie mac were being placed into conservatorship of the fhfa the action was one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades lockhart also dismissed the firms chief executive officers and boards of directors and caused the issuance to the treasury new senior preferred stock and common stock warrants amounting to  of each gse the value of the common stock and preferred stock to preconservatorship holders was greatly diminished by the suspension of future dividends on previously outstanding stock in the effort to maintain the value of company debt and of mortgagebacked securities fhfa stated that there are no plans to liquidate the company the authority of the us treasury to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing fannie mae or freddie mac is limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to the july   law enabling expanded regulatory authority over fannie mae and freddie mac increased the national debt ceiling us billion to a total of us trillion in anticipation of the potential need for the treasury to have the flexibility to support the federal home loan banks  – delistingedit on june   fannie mae and freddie mac announced their stocks would be delisted from the nyse the federal housing finance agency directed the delisting after fannies stock traded below  a share for over  days since then the stocks have continued to trade on the overthecounter bulletin board  –  billion dividendedit in may  fannie mae announced that it is going to pay a dividend of  billion to the united states treasury  –  billion dividend paidedit  billion received from treasury  billion paid to treasury fannie mae  financial results enabled them to pay  billion in dividends to treasury for the year resulting in a cumulative total of  billion in dividends through december   – approximately  billion more than fannie mae received in support as of march   fannie mae expects to have paid a total of  billion in payments to treasury businessedit fannie mae makes money partly by borrowing at low rates and then reinvesting its borrowings into whole mortgages and mortgage backed securities it borrows in the debt markets by selling bonds and provides liquidity to mortgage originators by purchasing whole loans it purchases whole loans and then securitizes them for the investment market by creating mbs that are either retained or sold as a government sponsored enterprise or gse fannie mae is compelled by law to provide liquidity to mortgage originators in all economic conditions it must legally ignore adverse market conditions which appear to be unprofitable if there are loans available for purchase that meet its predetermined underwriting standards it must purchase them if no other buyers are available due to the size scale and scope of the united states singlefamily residential and commercial residential markets market participants viewed fannie mae corporate debt as having a very high probability of being repaid fannie mae is able to borrow very inexpensively in the debt markets as a consequence of market perception there usually exists a large difference between the rate it can borrow at and the rate it can lend at this was called the big fat gap by alan greenspan by august  fannie maes mortgage portfolio was in excess of  billion fannie mae also earns a significant portion of its income from guaranty fees it receives as compensation for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying its singlefamily fannie mae mbs and on the singlefamily mortgage loans held in its retained portfolio investors or purchasers of fannie mae mbss are willing to let fannie mae keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk that is fannie maes guarantee that the scheduled principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid even if the borrower defaults fannie maes charter has historically prevented it from guaranteeing mortgages with a loantovalues over  without mortgage insurance or a repurchase agreement with the lender however in  and  fannie mae did purchase subprime and alta loans as investments business mechanismedit fannie mae is a purchaser of mortgages which it packages into mbs fannie mae buys loans from approved mortgage sellers and securitizes them it then sells the resultant mortgagebacked security to investors in the secondary mortgage market along with a guarantee that the stated principal and interest payments will be timely passed through to the investorcitation needed in addition fannie mbs like those of fannie mae mbs and ginnie mae mbs are eligible to be traded in the tobeannounced or tba market by purchasing the mortgages fannie mae and freddie mac provide banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new loans this gives the united states housing and credit markets flexibility and liquidity in order for fannie mae to provide its guarantee to mortgagebacked securities it issues it sets the guidelines for the loans that it will accept for purchase called conforming loans fannie mae produced an automated underwriting system aus tool called desktop underwriter du which lenders can use to automatically determine if a loan is conforming fannie mae followed this program up in  with custom du which allows lenders to set custom underwriting rules to handle nonconforming loans as well the secondary market for nonconforming loans includes jumbo loans which are mortgages larger than the maximum mortgage that fannie mae and freddie mac will purchase in early  the decision was made to allow tba tobeannouncedeligible mortgagebacked securities to include up to  jumbo mortgages conforming loansedit fannie mae and freddie mac have a limit on the maximum sized loan they will guarantee this is known as the conforming loan limit the conforming loan limit for fannie mae along with freddie mac is set by office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo the regulator of both gses ofheo annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan based on the october to october changes in mean home price above which a mortgage is considered a nonconforming jumbo loan the conforming loan limit is  percent higher in alaska and hawaii the gses only buy loans that are conforming to repackage into the secondary market lowering the demand for nonconforming loans by virtue of the law of supply and demand then it is harder for lenders to sell these loans in the secondary market thus these types of loans tend to cost more to borrowers typically  to  of a percent indeed in  since the demand for bonds not guaranteed by gses was almost nonexistent nonconforming loans were priced nearly  to  higher than conforming loans implicit guarantee and government supportedit originally fannie had an explicit guarantee from the government if it got in trouble the government promised to bail it out this changed in  ginnie mae was split off from fannie ginnie retained the explicit guarantee fannie however became a private corporation chartered by congress and with a direct line of credit to the us treasury it was its nature as a government sponsored enterprise gse that provided the implied guarantee for their borrowing the charter also limited their business activity to the mortgage market in this regard although they were a private company they could not operate like a regular private company fannie mae received no direct government funding or backing fannie mae securities carried no actual explicit government guarantee of being repaid this was clearly stated in the law that authorizes gses on the securities themselves and in many public communications issued by fannie maecitation needed neither the certificates nor payments of principal and interest on the certificates were explicitly guaranteed by the united states government the certificates did not legally constitute a debt or obligation of the united states or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than fannie mae during the subprime era every fannie mae prospectus read in bold allcaps letters the certificates and payments of principal and interest on the certificates are not guaranteed by the united states and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the united states or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than fannie mae verbiage changed from allcaps to standard case for readabilitycitation needed however the implied guarantee as well as various special treatments given to fannie by the government greatly enhanced its success for example the implied guarantee allowed fannie mae and freddie mac to save billions in borrowing costs as their credit rating was very good estimates by the congressional budget office and the treasury department put the figure at about  billion per year vernon l smith  nobel laureate in economics has called fhlmc and fnma implicitly taxpayerbacked agencies the economist has referred to the implicit government guarantee of fhlmc and fnma in testimony before the house and senate banking committee in  alan greenspan expressed the belief that fannie maes weak financial position was the result of markets believing that the us government would never allow fannie mae or freddie mac to fail fannie mae and freddie mac were allowed to hold less capital than normal financial institutions eg they were allowed to sell mortgagebacked securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions regulations exist through the fdic bank holding company act that govern the solvency of financial institutions the regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capitalasset ratio greater than or equal to  the gses fannie mae and freddie mac are exempt from this capitalasset ratio requirement and can and often do maintain a capitalasset ratio less than  the additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times but put the companies at greater risk in bad times such as during the subprime mortgage crisis fnma is not exempt from state and local taxes in addition fnma and fhlmc are exempt from sec filing requirements they file sec k and q reports but many other reports such as certain reports regarding their remic mortgage securities are not filed lastly money market funds have diversification requirements so that not more than  of assets may be from the same issuer that is a worstcase default would drop a fund not more than five percent however these rules do not apply to fannie and freddie it would not be unusual to find a fund that had the vast majority of its assets in fannie and freddie debtcitation needed in  the congressional budget office wrote there have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies but in the place of federal funds the government provides considerable unpriced benefits to the enterprises

kellermann committed suicide during his tenure at freddie a contemporaneous report on the sec charges continued the sec said mudd’s misconduct included knowingly giving false testimony to congress

standards board the changes made by the bill would mean that fannie mae and freddie mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs

securities sold to fannie and freddie didnt accurately describe the loans’ quality “the magnitude of falsity conservatively measured is enormous” she wrote during the boom fannie and freddie invested billions of dollars in mortgagebacked securities issued by such companies as nomura those investments bolstered profits but in the bust contributed to steep losses that ultimately resulted in the companies’  government takeover nomura and rbs were two of  financial institutions including bank of america corp and goldman sachs group inc targeted in  by the fhfa which alleged that the companies lied about the quality of the loans underlying the securities during the nonjury trial lawyers for the fhfa said that nomura and rbs inflated values of homes behind some mortgages and sometimes said a
