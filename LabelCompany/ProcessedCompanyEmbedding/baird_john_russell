in july  and was intended to highlight the harris governments record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls baird told reporters that  people had left the system since the introduction of workfare and used this figure to argue that the governments policy was a success at the time he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs and he also did not account for  of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list a number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in ontario a september  report from bairds ministry showed that  workfare placements had been created in the first six months of  a figure which the toronto star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from  to  baird was criticized in late  for

year he stated that his department would spend  million on shelters and other funding for the homeless baird supported mandatory drugtesting for welfare recipients and argued that those who refused such tests should be at risk of have their assistance cut off he introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late  in which he dramatically cast a box of syringes onto the floor and said that his department planned to stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm and to help them shoot up the ladder of success baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of welfare recipients abusing drugs although he cited estimates of between  and  the proposal was criticized by several people including ontario human rights commissioner keith norton a former progressive conservative cabinet minister who expressed concern that it could violate ontarios human rights code but officials including baird justified the measures as necessary in order to push people still receiving assistance toward independence shortly after bairds announcement a government website operated by the ministry of community and social services launched an attack against liberal party leader dalton mcguinty for opposing the drug testing plan the site claimed that mcguinty was opposed to helping welfare recipients who are addicted to drugs

house leader in june  after chris stockwell was forced to resign following allegations that he had used government funds for a family vacation as energy minister baird was entrusted with implementing the governments plan to sell off part of ontarios hydro one a few months later he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals the energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late  after hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province critics argued that the progressive conservative governments price deregulation policy implemented before baird became energy minister was responsible baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer rates remained high through the autumn and the eves government was forced to reregulate the market in november by introducing a price cap the government continued to support deregulation in principle but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office the second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late january  when premier eves announced that hydro one would remain under public control baird was regarded as less combative as energy minister than he had been in community and social services the energy policies of the eves government were controversial but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at baird eves took a prominent interest in the energy portfolio and sometimes relegated baird to a secondary role in policy announcements in november  however he was followed around the province by hydrozilla a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the ontario new democratic party as a stunt to show that deregulating electricity rates would create an economic monster for consumers in early march  baird announced that the government might be forced to implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages he encouraged conservation in late summer  following a provincewide blackout caused by a generator

that he sanctioned conservative and ndp members for behaviour he would allow from liberals at one stage baird described curlings job performance as an absolute disgrace baird cochaired jim flahertys second campaign to lead the progressive conservative party in  flaherty was again unsuccessful losing on the second ballot to the more centrist john tory baird and flaherty left provincial politics in

happen in  he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the conservative party baird won a contested nomination battle for ottawa west—nepean conservative nomination on may   defeating challengers ed mahfouz margret kopala and ade olumide john pacheco a leader in the social conservative movement against samesex marriage had sought the nomination but was disqualified due to past comments he had made alleging that homosexual practices posed a health risk pacheco later campaigned in the election as an independent conservative with the specific intent of being a spoiler against baird he argued that if his campaign caused baird to lose the conservatives would get the message that social conservatives are serious about their politics baird chose to ignore pacheco entirely in at least one allcandidates debate baird was elected defeating liberal candidate lee farnworth by about  votes the ottawa citizen endorsed baird in this campaign and argued that his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a harris cabinet minister in december  baird was one of thirteen conservative mps who voted against reopening the national debate on samesex marriage baird played an aggressive role in question period after his appointment to cabinet leading mp garth turner to describe him as stephen harpers commons pit bull president of the treasury boardedit baird was appointed president of the treasury board on february   following his appointment he said that one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from ottawa to other regions for political purposes baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government in june  he announced the creation of a threemember panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues one of the members was frances lankin a former ontario new democratic party cabinet minister accountability actedit baird introduced the conservative governments first piece of legislation in april  the accountability act promised significant reform to the structure of canadian politics and government prime minister harper said that it would put an end to the influence of money in the canadian government the accountability act restricted the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists provided protection to whistleblowers in the civil service and gave the auditor general of canada new powers of oversight it limited individual donations to political parties and candidates to  per year down from  created nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and placed crown corporations such as the canadian broadcasting corporation under accesstoinformation legislation opposition mps complained that several recommendations for accesstoinformation reform were omitted from the bill and were instead sent to committee for further review new democratic party mp pat martin suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future martin later made a deal with baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee in return for the conservatives accepting some ndp amendments information commissioner john reid criticized the new proposed powers for his department under the legislation arguing that they would create unnecessary bureaucracy shortly after the accountability act was introduced to parliament reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would increase the governments ability to cover up wrongdoing shield itself from embarrassment and control the flow of information to canadians he added that no government had ever put forward a more retrograde and dangerous set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws baird described reids criticisms as excessive stating that most of the commissioners specific concerns were minor in nature representatives of canadas business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors the bill passed the house of commons on division in june  the canadian senate approved it in december  with several amendments and sent it back to the commons for further consideration the amended act was approved by the commons without debate on december  and was signed into law four days later shortly after the bill first passed the commons baird acknowledged that the conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in  he told a senate committee that  million was left unreported and that he did not realize it was an issue at the time the matter is under review by the chief electoral officerwhen the conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the accountability act in november  stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions program cutsedit in may  baird was asked to find  billion in cuts for  and  on september  on the same day that the government announced a  billion surplus baird announced cuts to sixtysix federal programs including status of women medicinal marijuana research canadian museums adult literacy youth employment and social development and the british columbia pine beetle program one of the most controversial cuts was to the federal court challenges program which provided funding for canadians to pursue rights cases in the canadian court system baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that reflects the priorities of working families and that he just didnt think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the governments own laws in court in justifying cuts to adult literacy programs baird referenced his governments support for youth literacy and said weve got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact  ottawa municipal electionedit in early october  bairds department reviewed a promised  million grant to the city of ottawas lightrail expansion project for the otrain baird indicated that the government would keep the funding at least until the november election but added that the council elected in november would have the final say on the issue he also leaked details of the citys contact with the german firm siemens as a result the rail program became a focal issue in the  ottawa mayoral election and bairds opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome baird and ottawa mayor bob chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project and liberal mp navdeep bains asked the federal ethics commissioner to investigate bairds decision to release details of the private contract chiarelli was defeated in the election and the lightrail expansion was stopped by the new council an ottawa citizen report in january  revealed that federal officials had not posed any objections to the lightrail project before bairds intervention and suggested that his involvement was political in nature green party leader elizabeth may speculated that ottawa may have been deprived of lightrail service because of an apparent personal vendetta from baird against chiarelli baird denied this charge saying that his intervention was not political opponents of the lightrail project have argued that it was undertaken without sufficient consultation with the public in february  it was reported that the house of commons committee on government operations would be looking into his involvement over the case mp and committee member mark holland voiced a concern that baird leaked information on the contract baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying there is no evidence of anything speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation if you want to avert a billiondollar boondoggle you have to make some difficult decisions other responsibilitiesedit baird held ministerial responsibilities for the toronto harbourfront centre and the toronto waterfront revitalization corporation he developed a working relationship with toronto mayor david miller soon after his appointment and was present for the announcement of a

christmas  meeting with canadian soldiers in afghanistan environment minister –edit on january   baird was appointed as environment minister in a cabinet shuffle replacing rona ambrose in making the appointment prime minister stephen harper acknowledged that his government needed to do more to make the environment a priority some commentators remarked favourably on bairds appointment describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator columnist andrew coyne however described baird as the man sent to kill the issue suggesting that bairds appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms baird is a vocal opponent of the kyoto protocol which he argues will bring about an economic collapse later in  he added that any new environmental agreements must include reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as china india and the united states who have not signed the protocol or does not have any mandatory reductions set by the protocol baird met with renowned canadian environmentalist david suzuki following his appointment at the time suzuki said he was encouraged by bairds approach but remained skeptical of the harper governments environmental plans however when baird unveiled the conservative governments plan in april  suzuki confronted him calling the plan a disappointment approach to the kyoto protocoledit in february  the liberal opposition brought forward a nonbinding motion for canada to renew its commitment to the kyoto protocol all conservative mps who were present in the house including baird voted against the motion which passed with the support of the three opposition parties the following month opposition members on a special commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the governments clean air act among other things the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of kyoto targets baird indicated that the oppositions changes would not be included in federal targets or regulations in april  baird produced a federal study supported by five independent economists to support his approach to the kyoto protocol among the five economists was torontodominion bank chief economist don drummond who also wrote a private letter to baird arguing that the economic cost of implementing kyoto would be at least as deep as the recession in the early s opposition parliamentarians dismissed the report as a scare tactic while liberal environment critic david mcguinty argued that the study was misleading saying that it did not properly examine international emission trading and ignored jobs to be created through the green economy the report claimed that canadas ability to invest in developing nations to meet emissions targets through cdm by misquoting the amount of credit to be  million instead of the real approximation of  billion soon afterward a united nations report also contradicted the study mentioning that steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished at a cost of only  per cent of the worlds annual economic output but baird responded that canadas gas emission levels would peak in  three years before the uns set target of  environmental strategyedit baird was the harper governments representative at the release of a major united nations report on climate change in paris in february  he described the report as a turning point in the battle against climate change while indicating his surprise that human activity was found to be a major cause of the phenomenon baird released his governments targets for greenhouse gas emissions in late april  the plan calls for canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by  and for cuts to reach  by  under this plan canada will reach its kyoto targets between  and  taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than kyoto the government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps baird said that the plan strikes a balance between the perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect in december  baird revealed in a plan that over  bigpolluter companies including oil and gas pulp and paper electricity and iron and steel companies must cut greenhouse emissions by six percent between  and  the companies would also have to produce an annual report every may  that would include data regarding the level of greenhouses emissions produced each year bairds proposal has been met with approval from canadas oilpatch executives who described them as the toughest emission regulations in the world and who feared that more stringent standards would stifle oil sands exploration ontario premier dalton mcguinty had been considerably less critical than his brother federal liberal member of parliament david mcguinty having written to prime minister harper on the environmental policy the premier had stressed the importance of a policy that considered the north american market as a whole due to the automotive industrys importance to his province mcguinty said the conservatives environmental plan could have gone further but described the auto emissions part of the plan as very sensible members of opposition parties have criticized the governments abandonment of the kyoto goals while david suzuki described the proposal as a sham with weak targets former us vice president al gore said bairds plan was a complete and total fraud that was designed to mislead the canadian people baird responded by defending his plan and by criticizing gores environmental record noting that no similarly stringent measures were passed during gores tenure in office and that the kyoto treaty was never submitted to the us senate for ratification liberal party mp pablo rodriguez introduced to the house of commons a private bill that would have forced canada to comply with the kyoto treaty in response to the governments plan while the bill passed baird mentioned that even though that the government wouldnt dismiss the idea there were no new environmental measures planned all three opposition parties demanded that the environment become one of the main points of the governments throne speech in the  fall session environmental recordedit shortly after his appointment baird stephen harper and natural resources minister gary lunn announced  billion for cleanenergy initiatives over the next decade baird and lunn also announced a  million program for clean energy technology lunn said that there were literally hundreds of programs but there was no focus when the conservatives took office critics argued that the new conservative measures were similar to measures introduced by the liberals in their  budget former liberal leader stéphane dion has argued that the conservative partys strategy is too strongly focused on nuclear energy on february   baird appeared at a press conference with stephen harper and quebec premier jean charest to announce a  billion environmental fund for the provinces journalist frances russell criticized that as a reduction from the  billion promised by the previous liberal government canada is a signatory to the kyoto protocol which legally requires signatory countries to set up compatible carbon trading markets in direct defiance of this international legal obligation in march  baird indicated that he wanted canadian companies to be banned or at least severely restricted from participating in the international carbon market several european countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell credits on an international market many industry leaders argued that canada should adopt a similar policy thenopposition leader stéphane dion argued that participation will allow canadian firms to make megatonnes of money baird however described some carbon markets as shaky and argued that trade should be restricted to within canada or perhaps within north america in april he indicated that canadian businesses would soon gain the right to earn credits by investing in overseas environmental projects baird defended another conservative government decision to cut funds for climate science research arguing that further studies are largely superfluous in light of recent united nations reports gordon mcbean of the canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences has disagreed claiming that further research is the best way to adapt to a changing climate baird said in a house of commons committee that his government would not consider the implementation of a carbon tax he told that the governments approach will be to provide regulation for industry to ensure we reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollutants baliedit while participating at the united nations summit on climate changes in bali

supporters in less than ten hourscitation needed baird indicated afterward not only that he was loyal to harper but that he was uninterested in ever becoming party leader in  he told a newspaper some

welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from  to  baird was criticized in late  for refusing to cancel a fiveyear contract that had been signed between his department and the bermudabased private firm andersen consulting later accenture worth up to  million the contract signed when janet ecker was community and social services minister entrusted andersen with providing technological upgrades to the provinces welfare management system the arrangement was criticized by auditor general erik peters who observed that there was nothing in the contract to prevent andersen from increasing its hourly rates a published report in early  indicated that andersen was charging an average of  per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at  per hour another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of  million to find roughly  million worth of savings in response to opposition questions baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate baird opposed the harris governments plan to amalgamate the city of ottawa with neighboring municipalities which was approved by the legislature in  edit in january  baird unveiled a series of initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system this was highlighted by the establishment of a welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program the investigations baird initiated during the fiscal year of  uncovered  million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive and  million in avoided future costs but critics of this approach including opposition members poverty advocates and scholars suggested that the harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs in midyear baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province baird revealed a  million program in may  to help people with developmental disabilities become integrated into their communities he later affirmed that the province was considering closing its remaining three institutions for the mentally handicapped as part of a larger strategy focusing on home care baird expressed concern about the physical condition of these institutions saying that their residents deserve better later that same year he stated that his department would spend  million on shelters and other funding for the homeless baird supported mandatory drugtesting for welfare recipients and argued that those who refused such tests should be at risk of have their assistance cut off he introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late  in which he dramatically cast a box of syringes onto the floor and said that his department planned to stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm and to help them shoot up the ladder of success baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of welfare recipients abusing drugs although he cited estimates of between  and  the proposal was criticized by several people including ontario human rights commissioner keith norton a former progressive conservative cabinet minister who expressed concern that it could violate ontarios human rights code but officials including baird justified the measures as necessary in order to push people still receiving assistance toward independence shortly after bairds announcement a government website operated by the ministry of community and social services launched an attack against liberal party leader dalton mcguinty for opposing the drug testing plan the site claimed that mcguinty was opposed to helping welfare recipients who are addicted to drugs baird denied that the message was partisan and initially refused to apologize the speaker of the legislative assembly of ontario subsequently ruled that the site content was inappropriate and it was removed by the government with an apology –edit in early  baird announced that his governments proposed drugtesting plan would be extended to identify welfare recipients addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol he later announced that provincial welfare applicants would be required to pass a literacy test the harris governments welfare policies were put under scrutiny in august  after a pregnant woman in sudbury kimberly rogers died while serving a house arrest for welfare fraud the woman had been confined to her apartment for three months and reports indicated that her pregnancy was exacerbated by sweltering conditions in her apartment responding to criticism baird said that he could not comment on the specifics of the case until a coroners inquest was completed he defended his governments general policy on welfare issues a subsequent inquest did not assign blame to the government for the womans death but recommended that lifetime bans for fraud be eliminated and that adequate food housing and medication be provided to anyone under house arrest baird was given additional responsibilities as minister responsible for children on february   his department increased funding for child services early in the year amid a significant increase in provincial demand in november  the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending – cuts in provincial childcare programs baird initially declined to comment on the documents contents but rejected its proposals in early  baird was the first cabinet minister to support jim flahertys campaign to succeed mike harris as progressive conservative party leader in the partys  leadership election the election was won by flahertys rival ernie eves and early media reports suggested that baird might be dropped from the new premiers cabinet in april  he was not but was demoted to the position of chief government whip while remaining associate minister for francophone affairs his replacement in social services was brenda elliott who was from the more centrist wing of the progressive conservative party energy minister and government house leaderedit baird was returned to a more prominent cabinet position in august  after eves separated the ministries of environment and energy and appointed baird to head the latter department baird was given additional responsibilities as government house leader in june  after chris stockwell was forced to resign following allegations that he had used government funds for a family vacation as energy minister baird was entrusted with implementing the governments plan to sell off part of ontarios hydro one a few months later he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals the energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late  after hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province critics argued that the progressive conservative governments price deregulation policy implemented before baird became energy minister was responsible baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer rates remained high through the autumn and the eves government was forced to reregulate the market in november by introducing a price cap the government continued to support deregulation in principle but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office the second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late january  when premier eves announced that hydro one would remain under public control baird was regarded as less combative as energy minister than he had been in community and social services the energy policies of the eves government were controversial but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at baird eves took a prominent interest in the energy portfolio and sometimes relegated baird to a secondary role in policy announcements in november  however he was followed around the province by hydrozilla a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the ontario new democratic party as a stunt to show that deregulating electricity rates would create an economic monster for consumers in early march  baird announced that the government might be forced to implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages he encouraged conservation in late summer  following a provincewide blackout caused by a generator failure in the united states opposition memberedit the ontario liberal party won a majority government in the  election although baird was comfortably reelected in his own seat between  and  he served as official opposition critic for finance culture francophone affairs intergovernmental affairs and health he opposed the imposition of a health premium by dalton mcguintys government in  charging that the liberals broke an election pledge not the raise taxes baird and new democrat peter kormos were vocal critics of speaker alvin curling for allegedly favouring his liberal colleagues saying that he sanctioned conservative and ndp members for behaviour he would allow from liberals at one stage baird described curlings job performance as an absolute disgrace baird cochaired jim flahertys second campaign to lead the progressive conservative party in  flaherty was again unsuccessful losing on the second ballot to the more centrist john tory baird and flaherty left provincial politics in  to campaign for the federal house of commons although baird was generally on the right wing of the provincial progressive conservative party he expressed liberal views on some social issues he supported samesex marriage during the  provincial election and in  helped the mcguinty government achieve quick passage of a provincial bill granting legal recognition to samesex couples federal politicsedit baird supported a canadian alliance candidate in the  federal election and later endorsed stephen harpers bid to lead the newly formed conservative party of canada in its  leadership election he was appointed as the conservative partys ontario cochair for the  federal election there were rumours that baird would leave provincial politics to contest the  election but this did not happen in  he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the conservative party baird won a contested nomination battle for ottawa west—nepean conservative nomination on may   defeating challengers ed mahfouz margret kopala and ade olumide john pacheco a leader in the social conservative movement against samesex marriage had sought the nomination but was disqualified due to past comments he had made alleging that homosexual practices posed a health risk pacheco later campaigned in the election as an independent conservative with the specific intent of being a spoiler against baird he argued that if his campaign caused baird to lose the conservatives would get the message that social conservatives are serious about their politics baird chose to ignore pacheco entirely in at least one allcandidates debate baird was elected defeating liberal candidate lee farnworth by about  votes the ottawa citizen endorsed baird in this campaign and argued that his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a harris cabinet minister in december  baird was one of thirteen conservative mps who voted against reopening the national debate on samesex marriage baird played an aggressive role in question period after his appointment to cabinet leading mp garth turner to describe him as stephen harpers commons pit bull president of the treasury boardedit baird was appointed president of the treasury board on february   following his appointment he said that one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from ottawa to other regions for political purposes baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government in june  he announced the creation of a threemember panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues one of the members was frances lankin a former ontario new democratic party cabinet minister accountability actedit baird introduced the conservative governments first piece of legislation in april  the accountability act promised significant reform to the structure of canadian politics and government prime minister harper said that it would put an end to the influence of money in the canadian government the accountability act restricted the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists provided protection to whistleblowers in the civil service and gave the auditor general of canada new powers of oversight it limited individual donations to political parties and candidates to  per year down from  created nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and placed crown corporations such as the canadian broadcasting corporation under accesstoinformation legislation opposition mps complained that several recommendations for accesstoinformation reform were omitted from the bill and were instead sent to committee for further review new democratic party mp pat martin suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future martin later made a deal with baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee in return for the conservatives accepting some ndp amendments information commissioner john reid criticized the new proposed powers for his department under the legislation arguing that they would create unnecessary bureaucracy shortly after the accountability act was introduced to parliament reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would increase the governments ability to cover up wrongdoing shield itself from embarrassment and control the flow of information to canadians he added that no government had ever put forward a more retrograde and dangerous set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws baird described reids criticisms as excessive stating that most of the commissioners specific concerns were minor in nature representatives of canadas business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors the bill passed the house of commons on division in june  the canadian senate approved it in december  with several amendments and sent it back to the commons for further consideration the amended act was approved by the commons without debate on december  and was signed into law four days later shortly after the bill first passed the commons baird acknowledged that the conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in  he told a senate committee that  million was left unreported and that he did not realize it was an issue at the time the matter is under review by the chief electoral officerwhen the conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the accountability act in november  stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions program cutsedit in may  baird was asked to find  billion in cuts for  and  on september  on the same day that the government announced a  billion surplus baird announced cuts to sixtysix federal programs including status of women medicinal marijuana research canadian museums adult literacy youth employment and social development and the british columbia pine beetle program one of the most controversial cuts was to the federal court challenges program which provided funding for canadians to pursue rights cases in the canadian court system baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that reflects the priorities of working families and that he just didnt think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the governments own laws in court in justifying cuts to adult literacy programs baird referenced his governments support for youth literacy and said weve got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact  ottawa municipal electionedit in early october  bairds department reviewed a promised  million grant to the city of ottawas lightrail expansion project for the otrain baird indicated that the government would keep the funding at least until the november election but added that the council elected in november would have the final say on the issue he also leaked details of the citys contact with the german firm siemens as a result the rail program became a focal issue in the  ottawa mayoral election and bairds opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome baird and ottawa mayor bob chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project and liberal mp navdeep bains asked the federal ethics commissioner to investigate bairds decision to release details of the private contract chiarelli was defeated in the election and the lightrail expansion was stopped by the new council an ottawa citizen report in january  revealed that federal officials had not posed any objections to the lightrail project before bairds intervention and suggested that his involvement was political in nature green party leader elizabeth may speculated that ottawa may have been deprived of lightrail service because of an apparent personal vendetta from baird against chiarelli baird denied this charge saying that his intervention was not political opponents of the lightrail project have argued that it was undertaken without sufficient consultation with the public in february  it was reported that the house of commons committee on government operations would be looking into his involvement over the case mp and committee member mark holland voiced a concern that baird leaked information on the contract baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying there is no evidence of anything speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation if you want to avert a billiondollar boondoggle you have to make some difficult decisions other responsibilitiesedit baird held ministerial responsibilities for the toronto harbourfront centre and the toronto waterfront revitalization corporation he developed a working relationship with toronto mayor david miller soon after his appointment and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in june  ontario cabinet minister david caplan described baird as a champion of waterfront renewal and miller described him as an ally of the city baird spent christmas  meeting with canadian soldiers in afghanistan environment minister –edit on january   baird was appointed as environment minister in a cabinet shuffle replacing rona ambrose in making the appointment prime minister stephen harper acknowledged that his government needed to do more to make the environment a priority some commentators remarked favourably on bairds appointment describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator columnist andrew coyne however described baird as the man sent to kill the issue suggesting that bairds appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms baird is a vocal opponent of the kyoto protocol which he argues will bring about an economic collapse later in  he added that any new environmental agreements must include reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as china india and the united states who have not signed the protocol or does not have any mandatory reductions set by the protocol baird met with renowned canadian environmentalist david suzuki following his appointment at the time suzuki said he was encouraged by bairds approach but remained skeptical of the harper governments environmental plans however when baird unveiled the conservative governments plan in april  suzuki confronted him calling the plan a disappointment approach to the kyoto protocoledit in february  the liberal opposition brought forward a nonbinding motion for canada to renew its commitment to the kyoto protocol all conservative mps who were present in the house including baird voted against the motion which passed with the support of the three opposition parties the following month opposition members on a special commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the governments clean air act among other things the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of kyoto targets baird indicated that the oppositions changes would not be included in federal targets or regulations in april  baird produced a federal study supported by five independent economists to support his approach to the kyoto protocol among the five economists was torontodominion bank chief economist don drummond who also wrote a private letter to baird arguing that the economic cost of implementing kyoto would be at least as deep as the recession in the early s opposition parliamentarians dismissed the report as a scare tactic while liberal environment critic david mcguinty argued that the study was misleading saying that it did not properly examine international emission trading and ignored jobs to be created through the green economy the report claimed that canadas ability to invest in developing nations to meet emissions targets through cdm by misquoting the amount of credit to be  million instead of the real approximation of  billion soon afterward a united nations report also contradicted the study mentioning that steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished at a cost of only  per cent of the worlds annual economic output but baird responded that canadas gas emission levels would peak in  three years before the uns set target of  environmental strategyedit baird was the harper governments representative at the release of a major united nations report on climate change in paris in february  he described the report as a turning point in the battle against climate change while indicating his surprise that human activity was found to be a major cause of the phenomenon baird released his governments targets for greenhouse gas emissions in late april  the plan calls for canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by  and for cuts to reach  by  under this plan canada will reach its kyoto targets between  and  taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than kyoto the government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps baird said that the plan strikes a balance between the perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect in december  baird revealed in a plan that over  bigpolluter companies including oil and gas pulp and paper electricity and iron and steel companies must cut greenhouse emissions by six percent between  and  the companies would also have to produce an annual report every may  that would include data regarding the level of greenhouses emissions produced each year bairds proposal has been met with approval from canadas oilpatch executives who described them as the toughest emission regulations in the world and who feared that more stringent standards would stifle oil sands exploration ontario premier dalton mcguinty had been considerably less critical than his brother federal liberal member of parliament david mcguinty having written to prime minister harper on the environmental policy the premier had stressed the importance of a policy that considered the north american market as a whole due to the automotive industrys importance to his province mcguinty said the conservatives environmental plan could have gone further but described the auto emissions part of the plan as very sensible members of opposition parties have criticized the governments abandonment of the kyoto goals while david suzuki described the proposal as a sham with weak targets former us vice president al gore said bairds plan was a complete and total fraud that was designed to mislead the canadian people baird responded by defending his plan and by criticizing gores environmental record noting that no similarly stringent measures were passed during gores tenure in office and that the kyoto treaty was never submitted to the us senate for ratification liberal party mp pablo rodriguez introduced to the house of commons a private bill that would have forced canada to comply with the kyoto treaty in response to the governments plan while the bill passed baird mentioned that even though that the government wouldnt dismiss the idea there were no new environmental measures planned all three opposition parties demanded that the environment become one of the main points of the governments throne speech in the  fall session environmental recordedit shortly after his appointment baird stephen harper and natural resources minister gary lunn announced  billion for cleanenergy initiatives over the next decade baird and lunn also announced a  million program for clean energy technology lunn said that there were literally hundreds of programs but there was no focus when the conservatives took office critics argued that the new conservative measures were similar to measures introduced by the liberals in their  budget former liberal leader stéphane dion has argued that the conservative partys strategy is too strongly focused on nuclear energy on february   baird appeared at a press conference with stephen harper and quebec premier jean charest to announce a  billion environmental fund for the provinces journalist frances russell criticized that as a reduction from the  billion promised by the previous liberal government canada is a signatory to the kyoto protocol which legally requires signatory countries to set up compatible carbon trading markets in direct defiance of this international legal obligation in march  baird indicated that he wanted canadian companies to be banned or at least severely restricted from participating in the international carbon market several european countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell credits on an international market many industry leaders argued that canada should adopt a similar policy thenopposition leader stéphane dion argued that participation will allow canadian firms to make megatonnes of money baird however described some carbon markets as shaky and argued that trade should be restricted to within canada or perhaps within north america in april he indicated that canadian businesses would soon gain the right to earn credits by investing in overseas environmental projects baird defended another conservative government decision to cut funds for climate science research arguing that further studies are largely superfluous in light of recent united nations reports gordon mcbean of the canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences has disagreed claiming that further research is the best way to adapt to a changing climate baird said in a house of commons committee that his government would not consider the implementation of a carbon tax he told that the governments approach will be to provide regulation for industry to ensure we reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollutants baliedit while participating at the united nations summit on climate changes in bali indonesia baird announced a  million funding to help canadian communities notably coping with the loss of forests due to pine beetles in the west and of infrastructures in the north due to softer soil the fouryear plan included  million on several projects and  million for research baird was criticized by some parties and observers for obstructing progress on what was to become the bali action plan baird showed up for the bali conference at which it was intended he explain canadas position at a meeting with nongovernmental activists but instead quickly left with one of the activists alleging that baird left because he probably did not want to confront young activists critical of canadas stand draft baird movementedit in late november and early december  a website went online allegedly representing a movement to draft baird for leader of the conservative party in the face of stephen harper facing possible defeat by an opposition coalition the draft group allegedly comprised over  party members from across the country—including two mps and one senator who reportedly had requested anonymity in its only contact with the media the campaign claimed it had nearly  visitors and  new supporters in less than ten hourscitation needed baird indicated afterward not only that he was loyal to harper but that he was uninterested in ever becoming party leader in  he told a newspaper some people may have when growing up always harboured leadership ambitions ive never harboured leadership ambitions

un climate talks canada under baird was accused of working against progressive legislation to address climate change cited for cancelling support for clean energy and for failing to have any plan to

likuds opposition to palestinian statehood while visiting israel in february  on september   he announced the sudden closure of canadas embassy in tehran and the expulsion of all iranian diplomats from canada baird made the announcement at an asiapacific economic cooperation meeting in russia he said canadas decision was not linked to growing speculation of an imminent attack by israel on irans

prime minister benjamin netanyahu who described them as bold leadership  baird signed an agreement between the governments of the united arab emirates and canada for cooperation in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy bairds criticism of the stance of several african countries on samesex rights and of the russian federation for its ban on homosexual propaganda and other moves to

ontarios workfare program as one of harriss few bilingual ministers he was also named as minister responsible for francophone affairs edit bairds first press conference as a cabinet minister was held in july  and was intended to highlight the harris governments record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls baird told reporters that  people had left the system since the introduction of workfare and used this figure to argue that the governments policy was a success at the time he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs and he also did not account for  of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list a number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in ontario a september  report from bairds ministry showed that  workfare placements had been created in the first six months of  a figure which the toronto star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from  to  baird was criticized in late  for refusing to cancel a fiveyear contract that had been signed between his department and the bermudabased private firm andersen consulting later accenture worth up to  million the contract signed when janet ecker was community and social services minister entrusted andersen with providing technological upgrades to the provinces welfare management system the arrangement was criticized by auditor general erik peters who observed that there was nothing in the contract to prevent andersen from increasing its hourly rates a published report in early  indicated that andersen was charging an

the city of ottawa with neighboring municipalities which was approved by the legislature in  edit in january  baird unveiled a series of initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare

given a lifetime ban from the program the investigations baird initiated during the fiscal year of  uncovered  million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive and  million in avoided future costs but critics of this approach including opposition members poverty advocates and scholars suggested that the harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs in midyear baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province baird revealed a  million program in may  to help people with developmental disabilities become integrated into their communities he later affirmed that the province was considering closing its remaining three institutions for the mentally handicapped as part of a larger strategy focusing on home care baird expressed concern about the physical condition of these institutions saying that their residents deserve better later that same year he stated that his department would spend  million on shelters and other funding for the homeless baird supported mandatory drugtesting for welfare recipients and argued that those who refused such tests should be at risk of have their assistance cut off he introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late  in which he dramatically cast a box of syringes onto the floor and said that his department planned to stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm and to help them shoot up the ladder of success baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of welfare recipients abusing drugs although he cited estimates of between  and  the proposal was criticized by several people including ontario human rights commissioner keith norton a former progressive conservative cabinet minister who expressed concern that it could violate ontarios human rights code but officials including baird justified the measures as necessary in order to push people still receiving assistance toward independence shortly after bairds announcement a government website operated by the ministry of community and social services launched an attack against liberal party leader dalton mcguinty for opposing the drug testing plan the site claimed that mcguinty was opposed to helping welfare recipients who are addicted to drugs baird denied that the message was partisan and initially refused to apologize the speaker of the legislative assembly of ontario subsequently ruled that the site content was inappropriate and it was removed by the government with an apology –edit in early  baird announced that his governments proposed drugtesting plan would be extended to identify welfare recipients addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol he later announced that provincial welfare applicants would be required to pass a literacy test the harris governments welfare policies were put under scrutiny in august  after a pregnant woman in sudbury kimberly rogers died while serving a house arrest for welfare fraud the woman had been confined to her apartment for three months and reports indicated that her pregnancy was exacerbated by sweltering conditions in her apartment responding to criticism baird said that he could not comment on the specifics of the case until a coroners inquest was completed he defended his governments general policy on welfare issues a subsequent inquest did not assign blame to the government for the womans death but recommended that lifetime bans for fraud be eliminated and that adequate food housing and medication be provided to anyone under house arrest baird was given additional responsibilities as minister responsible for children on february   his department increased funding for child services early in the year amid a significant increase in provincial demand in november  the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending – cuts in provincial childcare programs baird initially declined to comment on the documents contents but rejected its proposals in early  baird was the first cabinet minister to support jim flahertys campaign to succeed mike harris as progressive conservative party leader in the partys  leadership election the election was won by flahertys rival ernie eves and early media reports suggested that baird might be dropped from the new premiers cabinet in april  he was not but was demoted to the position of chief government whip while remaining associate minister for francophone affairs his replacement in social services was brenda elliott who was from the more centrist wing of the progressive conservative party energy minister and government house leaderedit baird was returned to a more prominent cabinet position in august  after eves separated the ministries of environment and energy and appointed baird to head the latter department baird was given additional responsibilities as government house leader in june  after chris stockwell was forced to resign following allegations that he had used government funds for a family vacation as energy minister baird was entrusted with implementing the governments plan to sell off part of ontarios hydro one a few months later he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals the energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late  after hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province critics argued that the progressive conservative governments price deregulation policy implemented before baird became energy minister was responsible baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer rates remained high through the autumn and the eves government was forced to reregulate the market in november by introducing a price cap the government continued to support deregulation in principle but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office the second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late january  when premier eves announced that hydro one would remain under public control baird was regarded as less combative as energy minister than he had been in community and social services the energy policies of the eves government were controversial but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at baird eves took a prominent interest in the energy portfolio and sometimes relegated baird to a secondary role in policy announcements in november  however he was followed around the province by hydrozilla a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the ontario new democratic party as a stunt to show that deregulating electricity rates would create an economic monster for consumers in early march  baird announced that the government might be forced to implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages he encouraged conservation in late summer  following a provincewide blackout caused by a generator

as official opposition critic for finance culture francophone affairs intergovernmental affairs and health he opposed the imposition of a health premium by dalton mcguintys government in  charging that the liberals broke an election pledge not the raise taxes baird and new democrat peter kormos were vocal critics of speaker alvin curling for allegedly favouring his liberal colleagues saying that he sanctioned conservative and ndp members for behaviour he would allow from liberals at one stage baird described curlings job performance as an absolute disgrace baird cochaired jim flahertys second campaign to lead the progressive conservative party in  flaherty was again unsuccessful losing on the second ballot to the more centrist john tory baird and flaherty left provincial politics in  to campaign for the federal house of commons although baird was generally on the right wing of the provincial progressive conservative party he expressed liberal views on some social issues he supported samesex marriage during the  provincial election and in  helped the mcguinty government achieve quick passage of a provincial bill granting legal recognition to samesex couples federal politicsedit baird supported a canadian alliance candidate in the  federal election and later endorsed stephen harpers bid to lead the newly formed conservative party of canada in its  leadership election he was appointed as the conservative partys ontario cochair for the  federal election there were rumours that baird would leave provincial politics to contest the  election but this did not happen in  he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the conservative party baird won a contested nomination battle for ottawa west—nepean conservative nomination on may   defeating challengers ed mahfouz margret kopala and ade olumide john pacheco a leader in the social conservative movement against samesex marriage had sought the nomination but was disqualified due to past comments he had made alleging that homosexual practices posed a health risk pacheco later campaigned in the election as an independent conservative with the specific intent of being a spoiler against baird he argued that if his campaign caused baird to lose the conservatives would get the message that social conservatives are serious about their politics baird chose to ignore pacheco entirely in at least one allcandidates debate baird was elected defeating liberal candidate lee farnworth by about  votes the ottawa citizen endorsed baird in this campaign and argued that his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a harris cabinet minister in december  baird was one of thirteen conservative mps who voted against reopening the national debate on samesex marriage baird played an aggressive role in question period after his appointment to cabinet leading mp garth turner to describe him as stephen harpers commons pit bull president of the treasury boardedit baird was appointed president of the treasury board on february   following his appointment he said that one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from ottawa to other regions for political purposes baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government in june  he announced the creation of a threemember panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues one of the members was frances lankin a former ontario new democratic party cabinet minister accountability actedit baird introduced the conservative governments first piece of legislation in april  the accountability act promised significant reform to the structure of canadian politics and government prime minister harper said that it would put an end to the influence of money in the canadian government the accountability act restricted the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists provided protection to whistleblowers in the civil service and gave the auditor general of canada new powers of oversight it limited individual donations to political parties and candidates to  per year down from  created nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and placed crown corporations such as the canadian broadcasting corporation under accesstoinformation legislation opposition mps complained that several recommendations for accesstoinformation reform were omitted from the bill and were instead sent to committee for further review new democratic party mp pat martin suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future martin later made a deal with baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee in return for the conservatives accepting some ndp amendments information commissioner john reid criticized the new proposed powers for his department under the legislation arguing that they would create unnecessary bureaucracy shortly after the accountability act was introduced to parliament reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would increase the governments ability to cover up wrongdoing shield itself from embarrassment and control the flow of information to canadians he added that no government had ever put forward a more retrograde and dangerous set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws baird described reids criticisms as excessive stating that most of the commissioners specific concerns were minor in nature representatives of canadas business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors the bill passed the house of commons on division in june  the canadian senate approved it in december  with several amendments and sent it back to the commons for further consideration the amended act was approved by the commons without debate on december  and was signed into law four days later shortly after the bill first passed the commons baird acknowledged that the conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in  he told a senate committee that  million was left unreported and that he did not realize it was an issue at the time the matter is under review by the chief electoral officerwhen the conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the accountability act in november  stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions program cutsedit in may  baird was asked to find  billion in cuts for  and  on september  on the same day that the government announced a  billion surplus baird announced cuts to sixtysix federal programs including status of women medicinal marijuana research canadian museums adult literacy youth employment and social development and the british columbia pine beetle program one of the most controversial cuts was to the federal court challenges program which provided funding for canadians to pursue rights cases in the canadian court system baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that reflects the priorities of working families and that he just didnt think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the governments own laws in court in justifying cuts to adult literacy programs baird referenced his governments support for youth literacy and said weve got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact  ottawa municipal electionedit in early october  bairds department reviewed a promised  million grant to the city of ottawas lightrail expansion project for the otrain baird indicated that the government would keep the funding at least until the november election but added that the council elected in november would have the final say on the issue he also leaked details of the citys contact with the german firm siemens as a result the rail program became a focal issue in the  ottawa mayoral election and bairds opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome baird and ottawa mayor bob chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project and liberal mp navdeep bains asked the federal ethics commissioner to investigate bairds decision to release details of the private contract chiarelli was defeated in the election and the lightrail expansion was stopped by the new council an ottawa citizen report in january  revealed that federal officials had not posed any objections to the lightrail project before bairds intervention and suggested that his involvement was political in nature green party leader elizabeth may speculated that ottawa may have been deprived of lightrail service because of an apparent personal vendetta from baird against chiarelli baird denied this charge saying that his intervention was not political opponents of the lightrail project have argued that it was undertaken without sufficient consultation with the public in february  it was reported that the house of commons committee on government operations would be looking into his involvement over the case mp and committee member mark holland voiced a concern that baird leaked information on the contract baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying there is no evidence of anything speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation if you want to avert a billiondollar boondoggle you have to make some difficult decisions other responsibilitiesedit baird held ministerial responsibilities for the toronto harbourfront centre and the toronto waterfront revitalization corporation he developed a working relationship with toronto mayor david miller soon after his appointment and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in june  ontario cabinet minister david caplan described baird as a champion of waterfront renewal and miller described him as an ally of the city baird spent christmas  meeting with canadian soldiers in afghanistan environment minister –edit on january   baird was appointed as environment minister in a cabinet shuffle replacing rona ambrose in making the appointment prime minister stephen harper acknowledged that his government needed to do more to make the environment a priority some commentators remarked favourably on bairds appointment describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator columnist andrew coyne however described baird as the man sent to kill the issue suggesting that bairds appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms baird is a vocal opponent of the kyoto protocol which he argues will bring about an economic collapse later in  he added that any new environmental agreements must include reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as china india and the united states who have not signed the protocol or does not have any mandatory reductions set by the protocol baird met with renowned canadian environmentalist david suzuki following his appointment at the time suzuki said he was encouraged by bairds approach but remained skeptical of the harper governments environmental plans however when baird unveiled the conservative governments plan in april  suzuki confronted him calling the plan a disappointment approach to the kyoto protocoledit in february  the liberal opposition brought forward a nonbinding motion for canada to renew its commitment to the kyoto protocol all conservative mps who were present in the house including baird voted against the motion which passed with the support of the three opposition parties the following month opposition members on a special commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the governments clean air act among other things the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of kyoto targets baird indicated that the oppositions changes would not be included in federal targets or regulations in april  baird produced a federal study supported by five independent economists to support his approach to the kyoto protocol among the five economists was torontodominion bank chief economist don drummond who also wrote a private letter to baird arguing that the economic cost of implementing kyoto would be at least as deep as the recession in the early s opposition parliamentarians dismissed the report as a scare tactic while liberal environment critic david mcguinty argued that the study was misleading saying that it did not properly examine international emission trading and ignored jobs to be created through the green economy the report claimed that canadas ability to invest in developing nations to meet emissions targets through cdm by misquoting the amount of credit to be  million instead of the real approximation of  billion soon afterward a united nations report also contradicted the study mentioning that steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished at a cost of only  per cent of the worlds annual economic output but baird responded that canadas gas emission levels would peak in  three years before the uns set target of  environmental strategyedit baird was the harper governments representative at the release of a major united nations report on climate change in paris in february  he described the report as a turning point in the battle against climate change while indicating his surprise that human activity was found to be a major cause of the phenomenon baird released his governments targets for greenhouse gas emissions in late april  the plan calls for canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by  and for cuts to reach  by  under this plan canada will reach its kyoto targets between  and  taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than kyoto the government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps baird said that the plan strikes a balance between the perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect in december  baird revealed in a plan that over  bigpolluter companies including oil and gas pulp and paper electricity and iron and steel companies must cut greenhouse emissions by six percent between  and  the companies would also have to produce an annual report every may  that would include data regarding the level of greenhouses emissions produced each year bairds proposal has been met with approval from canadas oilpatch executives who described them as the toughest emission regulations in the world and who feared that more stringent standards would stifle oil sands exploration ontario premier dalton mcguinty had been considerably less critical than his brother federal liberal member of parliament david mcguinty having written to prime minister harper on the environmental policy the premier had stressed the importance of a policy that considered the north american market as a whole due to the automotive industrys importance to his province mcguinty said the conservatives environmental plan could have gone further but described the auto emissions part of the plan as very sensible members of opposition parties have criticized the governments abandonment of the kyoto goals while david suzuki described the proposal as a sham with weak targets former us vice president al gore said bairds plan was a complete and total fraud that was designed to mislead the canadian people baird responded by defending his plan and by criticizing gores environmental record noting that no similarly stringent measures were passed during gores tenure in office and that the kyoto treaty was never submitted to the us senate for ratification liberal party mp pablo rodriguez introduced to the house of commons a private bill that would have forced canada to comply with the kyoto treaty in response to the governments plan while the bill passed baird mentioned that even though that the government wouldnt dismiss the idea there were no new environmental measures planned all three opposition parties demanded that the environment become one of the main points of the governments throne speech in the  fall session environmental recordedit shortly after his appointment baird stephen harper and natural resources minister gary lunn announced  billion for cleanenergy initiatives over the next decade baird and lunn also announced a  million program for clean energy technology lunn said that there were literally hundreds of programs but there was no focus when the conservatives took office critics argued that the new conservative measures were similar to measures introduced by the liberals in their  budget former liberal leader stéphane dion has argued that the conservative partys strategy is too strongly focused on nuclear energy on february   baird appeared at a press conference with stephen harper and quebec premier jean charest to announce a  billion environmental fund for the provinces journalist frances russell criticized that as a reduction from the  billion promised by the previous liberal government canada is a signatory to the kyoto protocol which legally requires signatory countries to set up compatible carbon trading markets in direct defiance of this international legal obligation in march  baird indicated that he wanted canadian companies to be banned or at least severely restricted from participating in the international carbon market several european countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell credits on an international market many industry leaders argued that canada should adopt a similar policy thenopposition leader stéphane dion argued that participation will allow canadian firms to make megatonnes of money baird however described some carbon markets as shaky and argued that trade should be restricted to within canada or perhaps within north america in april he indicated that canadian businesses would soon gain the right to earn credits by investing in overseas environmental projects baird defended another conservative government decision to cut funds for climate science research arguing that further studies are largely superfluous in light of recent united nations reports gordon mcbean of the canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences has disagreed claiming that further research is the best way to adapt to a changing climate baird said in a house of commons committee that his government would not consider the implementation of a carbon tax he told that the governments approach will be to provide regulation for industry to ensure we reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollutants baliedit while participating at the united nations summit on climate changes in bali indonesia baird announced a  million funding to help canadian communities notably coping with the loss of forests due to pine beetles in the west and of infrastructures in the north due to softer soil the fouryear plan included  million on several projects and  million for research baird was criticized by some parties and observers for obstructing progress on what was to become the bali action plan baird showed up for the bali conference at which it was intended he explain canadas position at a meeting with nongovernmental activists but instead quickly left with one of the activists alleging that baird left because he probably did not want to confront young activists critical of canadas stand draft baird movementedit in late november and early december  a website went online allegedly representing a movement to draft baird for leader of the conservative party in the face of stephen harper facing possible defeat by an opposition coalition the draft group allegedly comprised over  party members from across the country—including two mps and one senator who reportedly had requested anonymity in its only contact with the media the campaign claimed it had nearly  visitors and  new supporters in less than ten hourscitation needed baird indicated afterward not only that he was loyal to harper but that he was uninterested in ever becoming party leader in  he told a newspaper some people may have when growing up always harboured leadership ambitions ive never harboured leadership ambitions it is the honesttogod truth minister of transport –edit baird served as minister of transport between october   and august  citation needed interim environment minister –edit cancun climate fossil awardsedit after resuming his environment portfolio from november  until january  baird was the harper governments main representative to the united nations climate conference in cancun in december  on the first day canada “won” three fossil of the day awards awards which after a vote by more than  leadingwhich international organizations go to countries that do the most to disrupt or undermine un climate talks canada under baird was accused of working against progressive legislation to address climate change cited for cancelling support for clean energy and for failing to have any plan to meet its very weak target for reducing canadas greenhouse gas emissions foreign affairs minister –edit john baird with us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington dc august   john baird with clintons successor as us secretary of state john kerry in london united kingdom april   activists on board a canadian boat taking supplies to gaza which had been blockaded by the israeli government to ensure that weapons and other contraband did not enter gaza in november  urged baird to resign as foreign minister for failing to do his job they said they had been roughed up and tasered by israeli forces and that if minister baird wants to put the interests of a farright israeli government before canadians he should apply for the job of israels ambassador baird affirmed canadas support for likuds opposition to palestinian statehood while visiting israel in february  on september   he announced the sudden closure of canadas embassy in tehran and the expulsion of all iranian diplomats from canada baird made the announcement at an asiapacific economic cooperation meeting in russia he said canadas decision was not linked to growing speculation of an imminent attack by israel on irans nuclear facilities baird said canada views the government of iran as the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today canadas actions were immediately praised by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu who described them as bold leadership  baird signed an agreement between the governments of the united arab emirates and canada for cooperation in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy bairds criticism of the stance of several african countries on samesex rights and of the russian federation for its ban on homosexual propaganda and other moves to suppress lgbt rights have been condemned by the social conservative lobby group real women of canada which issued a statement accusing him of abuse of office claiming that mr bairds actions are destructive to the conservative base in canada and causing collateral damage to his party a spokesman for bairds office replied stating the promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of canada’s foreign policy baird refused to sign the world arms trade treaty with the canadian government reportedly ordering its diplomats to play a “lowkey minimal role” during negotiations and protect the rights of canadian gun owners resignation and departing public officeedit

community and social services where he became responsible for implementing and expanding ontarios workfare program as one of harriss few bilingual ministers he was also named as minister responsible for francophone affairs edit bairds first press conference as a cabinet minister was held in july  and was intended to highlight the harris governments record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls baird told reporters that  people had left the system since the introduction of workfare and used this figure to argue that the governments policy was a success at the time he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs and he also did not account for  of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list a number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in ontario a september  report from bairds ministry showed that  workfare placements had been created in the first six months of  a figure which the toronto star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from  to  baird was criticized in late  for refusing to cancel a fiveyear contract that had been signed between his department and the bermudabased private firm andersen consulting later accenture worth up to  million the contract signed when janet ecker was community and social services minister entrusted andersen with providing technological upgrades to the provinces welfare management system the arrangement was criticized by auditor general erik peters who observed that there was nothing in the contract to prevent andersen from increasing its hourly rates a published report in early  indicated that andersen was charging an average of  per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at  per hour another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of  million to find roughly  million worth of savings in response to opposition questions baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate baird opposed the harris governments plan to amalgamate the city of ottawa with neighboring municipalities which was approved by the legislature in  edit in january  baird unveiled a series of initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system this was highlighted by the establishment of a welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program the investigations baird initiated during the fiscal year of  uncovered  million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive and  million in avoided future costs but critics of this approach including opposition members poverty advocates and scholars suggested that the harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs in midyear baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province baird revealed a  million program in may  to help people with developmental disabilities become integrated into their communities he later affirmed that the province was considering closing its remaining three institutions for the mentally handicapped as part of a larger strategy focusing on home care baird expressed concern about the physical condition of these institutions saying that their residents deserve better later that same year he stated that his department would spend  million on shelters and other funding for the homeless baird supported mandatory drugtesting for welfare recipients and argued that those who refused such tests should be at risk of have their assistance cut off he introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late  in which he dramatically cast a box of syringes onto the floor and said that his department planned to stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm and to help them shoot up the ladder of success baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of welfare recipients abusing drugs although he cited estimates of between  and  the proposal was criticized by several people including ontario human rights commissioner keith norton a former progressive conservative cabinet minister who expressed concern that it could violate ontarios human rights code but officials including baird justified the measures as necessary in order to push people still receiving assistance toward independence shortly after bairds announcement a government website operated by the ministry of community and social services launched an attack against liberal party leader dalton mcguinty for opposing the drug testing plan the site claimed that mcguinty was opposed to helping welfare recipients who are addicted to drugs baird denied that the message was partisan and initially refused to apologize the speaker of the legislative assembly of ontario subsequently ruled that the site content was inappropriate and it was removed by the government with an apology –edit in early  baird announced that his governments proposed drugtesting plan would be extended to identify welfare recipients addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol he later announced that provincial welfare applicants would be required to pass a literacy test the harris governments welfare policies were put under scrutiny in august  after a pregnant woman in sudbury kimberly rogers died while serving a house arrest for welfare fraud the woman had been confined to her apartment for three months and reports indicated that her pregnancy was exacerbated by sweltering conditions in her apartment responding to criticism baird said that he could not comment on the specifics of the case until a coroners inquest was completed he defended his governments general policy on welfare issues a subsequent inquest did not assign blame to the government for the womans death but recommended that lifetime bans for fraud be eliminated and that adequate food housing and medication be provided to anyone under house arrest baird was given additional responsibilities as minister responsible for children on february   his department increased funding for child services early in the year amid a significant increase in provincial demand in november  the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending – cuts in provincial childcare programs baird initially declined to comment on the documents contents but rejected its proposals in early  baird was the first cabinet minister to support jim flahertys campaign to succeed mike harris as progressive conservative party leader in the partys  leadership election the election was won by flahertys rival ernie eves and early media reports suggested that baird might be dropped from the new premiers cabinet in april  he was not but was demoted to the position of chief government whip while remaining associate minister for francophone affairs his replacement in social services was brenda elliott who was from the more centrist wing of the progressive conservative party energy minister and government house leaderedit baird was returned to a more prominent cabinet position in august  after eves separated the ministries of environment and energy and appointed baird to head the latter department baird was given additional responsibilities as government house leader in june  after chris stockwell was forced to resign following allegations that he had used government funds for a family vacation as energy minister baird was entrusted with implementing the governments plan to sell off part of ontarios hydro one a few months later he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals the energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late  after hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province critics argued that the progressive conservative governments price deregulation policy implemented before baird became energy minister was responsible baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer rates remained high through the autumn and the eves government was forced to reregulate the market in november by introducing a price cap the government continued to support deregulation in principle but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office the second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late january  when premier eves announced that hydro one would remain under public control baird was regarded as less combative as energy minister than he had been in community and social services the energy policies of the eves government were controversial but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at baird eves took a prominent interest in the energy portfolio and sometimes relegated baird to a secondary role in policy announcements in november  however he was followed around the province by hydrozilla a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the ontario new democratic party as a stunt to show that deregulating electricity rates would create an economic monster for consumers in early march  baird announced that the government might be forced to implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages he encouraged conservation in late summer  following a provincewide blackout caused by a generator failure in the united states opposition memberedit the ontario liberal party won a majority government in the  election although baird was comfortably reelected in his own seat between  and  he served as official opposition critic for finance culture francophone affairs intergovernmental affairs and health he opposed the imposition of a health premium by dalton mcguintys government in  charging that the liberals broke an election pledge not the raise taxes baird and new democrat peter kormos were vocal critics of speaker alvin curling for allegedly favouring his liberal colleagues saying that he sanctioned conservative and ndp members for behaviour he would allow from liberals at one stage baird described curlings job performance as an absolute disgrace baird cochaired jim flahertys second campaign to lead the progressive conservative party in  flaherty was again unsuccessful losing on the second ballot to the more centrist john tory baird and flaherty left provincial politics in  to campaign for the federal house of commons although baird was generally on the right wing of the provincial progressive conservative party he expressed liberal views on some social issues he supported samesex marriage during the  provincial election and in  helped the mcguinty government achieve quick passage of a provincial bill granting legal recognition to samesex couples federal politicsedit baird supported a canadian alliance candidate in the  federal election and later endorsed stephen harpers bid to lead the newly formed conservative party of canada in its  leadership election he was appointed as the conservative partys ontario cochair for the  federal election there were rumours that baird would leave provincial politics to contest the  election but this did not happen in  he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the conservative party baird won a contested nomination battle for ottawa west—nepean conservative nomination on may   defeating challengers ed mahfouz margret kopala and ade olumide john pacheco a leader in the social conservative movement against samesex marriage had sought the nomination but was disqualified due to past comments he had made alleging that homosexual practices posed a health risk pacheco later campaigned in the election as an independent conservative with the specific intent of being a spoiler against baird he argued that if his campaign caused baird to lose the conservatives would get the message that social conservatives are serious about their politics baird chose to ignore pacheco entirely in at least one allcandidates debate baird was elected defeating liberal candidate lee farnworth by about  votes the ottawa citizen endorsed baird in this campaign and argued that his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a harris cabinet minister in december  baird was one of thirteen conservative mps who voted against reopening the national debate on samesex marriage baird played an aggressive role in question period after his appointment to cabinet leading mp garth turner to describe him as stephen harpers commons pit bull president of the treasury boardedit baird was appointed president of the treasury board on february   following his appointment he said that one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from ottawa to other regions for political purposes baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government in june  he announced the creation of a threemember panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues one of the members was frances lankin a former ontario new democratic party cabinet minister accountability actedit baird introduced the conservative governments first piece of legislation in april  the accountability act promised significant reform to the structure of canadian politics and government prime minister harper said that it would put an end to the influence of money in the canadian government the accountability act restricted the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists provided protection to whistleblowers in the civil service and gave the auditor general of canada new powers of oversight it limited individual donations to political parties and candidates to  per year down from  created nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and placed crown corporations such as the canadian broadcasting corporation under accesstoinformation legislation opposition mps complained that several recommendations for accesstoinformation reform were omitted from the bill and were instead sent to committee for further review new democratic party mp pat martin suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future martin later made a deal with baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee in return for the conservatives accepting some ndp amendments information commissioner john reid criticized the new proposed powers for his department under the legislation arguing that they would create unnecessary bureaucracy shortly after the accountability act was introduced to parliament reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would increase the governments ability to cover up wrongdoing shield itself from embarrassment and control the flow of information to canadians he added that no government had ever put forward a more retrograde and dangerous set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws baird described reids criticisms as excessive stating that most of the commissioners specific concerns were minor in nature representatives of canadas business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors the bill passed the house of commons on division in june  the canadian senate approved it in december  with several amendments and sent it back to the commons for further consideration the amended act was approved by the commons without debate on december  and was signed into law four days later shortly after the bill first passed the commons baird acknowledged that the conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in  he told a senate committee that  million was left unreported and that he did not realize it was an issue at the time the matter is under review by the chief electoral officerwhen the conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the accountability act in november  stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions program cutsedit in may  baird was asked to find  billion in cuts for  and  on september  on the same day that the government announced a  billion surplus baird announced cuts to sixtysix federal programs including status of women medicinal marijuana research canadian museums adult literacy youth employment and social development and the british columbia pine beetle program one of the most controversial cuts was to the federal court challenges program which provided funding for canadians to pursue rights cases in the canadian court system baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that reflects the priorities of working families and that he just didnt think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the governments own laws in court in justifying cuts to adult literacy programs baird referenced his governments support for youth literacy and said weve got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact  ottawa municipal electionedit in early october  bairds department reviewed a promised  million grant to the city of ottawas lightrail expansion project for the otrain baird indicated that the government would keep the funding at least until the november election but added that the council elected in november would have the final say on the issue he also leaked details of the citys contact with the german firm siemens as a result the rail program became a focal issue in the  ottawa mayoral election and bairds opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome baird and ottawa mayor bob chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project and liberal mp navdeep bains asked the federal ethics commissioner to investigate bairds decision to release details of the private contract chiarelli was defeated in the election and the lightrail expansion was stopped by the new council an ottawa citizen report in january  revealed that federal officials had not posed any objections to the lightrail project before bairds intervention and suggested that his involvement was political in nature green party leader elizabeth may speculated that ottawa may have been deprived of lightrail service because of an apparent personal vendetta from baird against chiarelli baird denied this charge saying that his intervention was not political opponents of the lightrail project have argued that it was undertaken without sufficient consultation with the public in february  it was reported that the house of commons committee on government operations would be looking into his involvement over the case mp and committee member mark holland voiced a concern that baird leaked information on the contract baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying there is no evidence of anything speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation if you want to avert a billiondollar boondoggle you have to make some difficult decisions other responsibilitiesedit baird held ministerial responsibilities for the toronto harbourfront centre and the toronto waterfront revitalization corporation he developed a working relationship with toronto mayor david miller soon after his appointment and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in june  ontario cabinet minister david caplan described baird as a champion of waterfront renewal and miller described him as an ally of the city baird spent christmas  meeting with canadian soldiers in afghanistan environment minister –edit on january   baird was appointed as environment minister in a cabinet shuffle replacing rona ambrose in making the appointment prime minister stephen harper acknowledged that his government needed to do more to make the environment a priority some commentators remarked favourably on bairds appointment describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator columnist andrew coyne however described baird as the man sent to kill the issue suggesting that bairds appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms baird is a vocal opponent of the kyoto protocol which he argues will bring about an economic collapse later in  he added that any new environmental agreements must include reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as china india and the united states who have not signed the protocol or does not have any mandatory reductions set by the protocol baird met with renowned canadian environmentalist david suzuki following his appointment at the time suzuki said he was encouraged by bairds approach but remained skeptical of the harper governments environmental plans however when baird unveiled the conservative governments plan in april  suzuki confronted him calling the plan a disappointment approach to the kyoto protocoledit in february  the liberal opposition brought forward a nonbinding motion for canada to renew its commitment to the kyoto protocol all conservative mps who were present in the house including baird voted against the motion which passed with the support of the three opposition parties the following month opposition members on a special commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the governments clean air act among other things the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of kyoto targets baird indicated that the oppositions changes would not be included in federal targets or regulations in april  baird produced a federal study supported by five independent economists to support his approach to the kyoto protocol among the five economists was torontodominion bank chief economist don drummond who also wrote a private letter to baird arguing that the economic cost of implementing kyoto would be at least as deep as the recession in the early s opposition parliamentarians dismissed the report as a scare tactic while liberal environment critic david mcguinty argued that the study was misleading saying that it did not properly examine international emission trading and ignored jobs to be created through the green economy the report claimed that canadas ability to invest in developing nations to meet emissions targets through cdm by misquoting the amount of credit to be  million instead of the real approximation of  billion soon afterward a united nations report also contradicted the study mentioning that steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished at a cost of only  per cent of the worlds annual economic output but baird responded that canadas gas emission levels would peak in  three years before the uns set target of  environmental strategyedit baird was the harper governments representative at the release of a major united nations report on climate change in paris in february  he described the report as a turning point in the battle against climate change while indicating his surprise that human activity was found to be a major cause of the phenomenon baird released his governments targets for greenhouse gas emissions in late april  the plan calls for canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by  and for cuts to reach  by  under this plan canada will reach its kyoto targets between  and  taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than kyoto the government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps baird said that the plan strikes a balance between the perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect in december  baird revealed in a plan that over  bigpolluter companies including oil and gas pulp and paper electricity and iron and steel companies must cut greenhouse emissions by six percent between  and  the companies would also have to produce an annual report every may  that would include data regarding the level of greenhouses emissions produced each year bairds proposal has been met with approval from canadas oilpatch executives who described them as the toughest emission regulations in the world and who feared that more stringent standards would stifle oil sands exploration ontario premier dalton mcguinty had been considerably less critical than his brother federal liberal member of parliament david mcguinty having written to prime minister harper on the environmental policy the premier had stressed the importance of a policy that considered the north american market as a whole due to the automotive industrys importance to his province mcguinty said the conservatives environmental plan could have gone further but described the auto emissions part of the plan as very sensible members of opposition parties have criticized the governments abandonment of the kyoto goals while david suzuki described the proposal as a sham with weak targets former us vice president al gore said bairds plan was a complete and total fraud that was designed to mislead the canadian people baird responded by defending his plan and by criticizing gores environmental record noting that no similarly stringent measures were passed during gores tenure in office and that the kyoto treaty was never submitted to the us senate for ratification liberal party mp pablo rodriguez introduced to the house of commons a private bill that would have forced canada to comply with the kyoto treaty in response to the governments plan while the bill passed baird mentioned that even though that the government wouldnt dismiss the idea there were no new environmental measures planned all three opposition parties demanded that the environment become one of the main points of the governments throne speech in the  fall session environmental recordedit shortly after his appointment baird stephen harper and natural resources minister gary lunn announced  billion for cleanenergy initiatives over the next decade baird and lunn also announced a  million program for clean energy technology lunn said that there were literally hundreds of programs but there was no focus when the conservatives took office critics argued that the new conservative measures were similar to measures introduced by the liberals in their  budget former liberal leader stéphane dion has argued that the conservative partys strategy is too strongly focused on nuclear energy on february   baird appeared at a press conference with stephen harper and quebec premier jean charest to announce a  billion environmental fund for the provinces journalist frances russell criticized that as a reduction from the  billion promised by the previous liberal government canada is a signatory to the kyoto protocol which legally requires signatory countries to set up compatible carbon trading markets in direct defiance of this international legal obligation in march  baird indicated that he wanted canadian companies to be banned or at least severely restricted from participating in the international carbon market several european countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell credits on an international market many industry leaders argued that canada should adopt a similar policy thenopposition leader stéphane dion argued that participation will allow canadian firms to make megatonnes of money baird however described some carbon markets as shaky and argued that trade should be restricted to within canada or perhaps within north america in april he indicated that canadian businesses would soon gain the right to earn credits by investing in overseas environmental projects baird defended another conservative government decision to cut funds for climate science research arguing that further studies are largely superfluous in light of recent united nations reports gordon mcbean of the canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences has disagreed claiming that further research is the best way to adapt to a changing climate baird said in a house of commons committee that his government would not consider the implementation of a carbon tax he told that the governments approach will be to provide regulation for industry to ensure we reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollutants baliedit while participating at the united nations summit on climate changes in bali indonesia baird announced a  million funding to help canadian communities notably coping with the loss of forests due to pine beetles in the west and of infrastructures in the north due to softer soil the fouryear plan included  million on several projects and  million for research baird was criticized by some parties and observers for obstructing progress on what was to become the bali action plan baird showed up for the bali conference at which it was intended he explain canadas position at a meeting with nongovernmental activists but instead quickly left with one of the activists alleging that baird left because he probably did not want to confront young activists critical of canadas stand draft baird movementedit in late november and early december  a website went online allegedly representing a movement to draft baird for leader of the conservative party in the face of stephen harper facing possible defeat by an opposition coalition the draft group allegedly comprised over  party members from across the country—including two mps and one senator who reportedly had requested anonymity in its only contact with the media the campaign claimed it had nearly  visitors and  new supporters in less than ten hourscitation needed baird indicated afterward not only that he was loyal to harper but that he was uninterested in ever becoming party leader in  he told a newspaper some people may have when growing up always harboured leadership ambitions ive never harboured leadership ambitions it is the honesttogod truth minister of transport –edit baird served as minister of transport between october   and august  citation needed interim environment minister –edit cancun climate fossil awardsedit after resuming his environment portfolio from november  until january  baird was the harper governments main representative to the united nations climate conference in cancun in december  on the first day canada “won” three fossil of the day awards awards which after a vote by more than  leadingwhich international organizations go to countries that do the most to disrupt or undermine un climate talks canada under baird was accused of working against progressive legislation to address climate change cited for cancelling support for clean energy and for failing to have any plan to meet its very weak target for reducing canadas greenhouse gas emissions foreign affairs minister –edit john baird with us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington dc august   john baird with clintons successor as us secretary of state john kerry in london united kingdom april   activists on board a canadian boat taking supplies to gaza which had been blockaded by the israeli government to ensure that weapons and other contraband did not enter gaza in november  urged baird to resign as foreign minister for failing to do his job they said they had been roughed up and tasered by israeli forces and that if minister baird wants to put the interests of a farright israeli government before canadians he should apply for the job of israels ambassador baird affirmed canadas support for likuds opposition to palestinian statehood while visiting israel in february  on september   he announced the sudden closure of canadas embassy in tehran and the expulsion of all iranian diplomats from canada baird made the announcement at an asiapacific economic cooperation meeting in russia he said canadas decision was not linked to growing speculation of an imminent attack by israel on irans nuclear facilities baird said canada views the government of iran as the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today canadas actions were immediately praised by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu who described them as bold leadership  baird signed an agreement between the governments of the united arab emirates and canada for cooperation in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy bairds criticism of the stance of several african countries on samesex rights and of the russian federation for its ban on homosexual propaganda and other moves to suppress lgbt rights have been condemned by the social conservative lobby group real women of canada which issued a statement accusing him of abuse of office claiming that mr bairds actions are destructive to the conservative base in canada and causing collateral damage to his party a spokesman for bairds office replied stating the promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of canada’s foreign policy baird refused to sign the world arms trade treaty with the canadian government reportedly ordering its diplomats to play a “lowkey minimal role” during negotiations and protect the rights of canadian gun owners resignation and departing public officeedit following his resignation as minister of foreign affairs baird remained a backbench mp for several weeks on

in july  and was intended to highlight the harris governments record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls baird told reporters that  people had left the system since the introduction of workfare and used this figure to argue that the governments policy was a success at the time he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs and he also did not account for  of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list a number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in ontario a september  report from bairds ministry showed that  workfare placements had been created in the first six months of  a figure which the toronto star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from  to  baird was criticized in late  for

year he stated that his department would spend  million on shelters and other funding for the homeless baird supported mandatory drugtesting for welfare recipients and argued that those who refused such tests should be at risk of have their assistance cut off he introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late  in which he dramatically cast a box of syringes onto the floor and said that his department planned to stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm and to help them shoot up the ladder of success baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of welfare recipients abusing drugs although he cited estimates of between  and  the proposal was criticized by several people including ontario human rights commissioner keith norton a former progressive conservative cabinet minister who expressed concern that it could violate ontarios human rights code but officials including baird justified the measures as necessary in order to push people still receiving assistance toward independence shortly after bairds announcement a government website operated by the ministry of community and social services launched an attack against liberal party leader dalton mcguinty for opposing the drug testing plan the site claimed that mcguinty was opposed to helping welfare recipients who are addicted to drugs

house leader in june  after chris stockwell was forced to resign following allegations that he had used government funds for a family vacation as energy minister baird was entrusted with implementing the governments plan to sell off part of ontarios hydro one a few months later he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals the energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late  after hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province critics argued that the progressive conservative governments price deregulation policy implemented before baird became energy minister was responsible baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer rates remained high through the autumn and the eves government was forced to reregulate the market in november by introducing a price cap the government continued to support deregulation in principle but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office the second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late january  when premier eves announced that hydro one would remain under public control baird was regarded as less combative as energy minister than he had been in community and social services the energy policies of the eves government were controversial but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at baird eves took a prominent interest in the energy portfolio and sometimes relegated baird to a secondary role in policy announcements in november  however he was followed around the province by hydrozilla a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the ontario new democratic party as a stunt to show that deregulating electricity rates would create an economic monster for consumers in early march  baird announced that the government might be forced to implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages he encouraged conservation in late summer  following a provincewide blackout caused by a generator

that he sanctioned conservative and ndp members for behaviour he would allow from liberals at one stage baird described curlings job performance as an absolute disgrace baird cochaired jim flahertys second campaign to lead the progressive conservative party in  flaherty was again unsuccessful losing on the second ballot to the more centrist john tory baird and flaherty left provincial politics in

happen in  he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the conservative party baird won a contested nomination battle for ottawa west—nepean conservative nomination on may   defeating challengers ed mahfouz margret kopala and ade olumide john pacheco a leader in the social conservative movement against samesex marriage had sought the nomination but was disqualified due to past comments he had made alleging that homosexual practices posed a health risk pacheco later campaigned in the election as an independent conservative with the specific intent of being a spoiler against baird he argued that if his campaign caused baird to lose the conservatives would get the message that social conservatives are serious about their politics baird chose to ignore pacheco entirely in at least one allcandidates debate baird was elected defeating liberal candidate lee farnworth by about  votes the ottawa citizen endorsed baird in this campaign and argued that his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a harris cabinet minister in december  baird was one of thirteen conservative mps who voted against reopening the national debate on samesex marriage baird played an aggressive role in question period after his appointment to cabinet leading mp garth turner to describe him as stephen harpers commons pit bull president of the treasury boardedit

other regions for political purposes baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government in june  he announced the creation of a threemember panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues one of the members was frances lankin a former ontario new democratic party cabinet minister accountability actedit baird introduced the conservative governments first piece of legislation in april  the accountability act promised significant reform to the structure of canadian politics and government prime minister harper said that it would put an end to the influence of money in the canadian government the accountability act restricted the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists provided protection to whistleblowers in the civil service and gave the auditor general of canada new powers of oversight it limited individual donations to political parties and candidates to  per year down from  created nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and placed crown corporations such as the canadian broadcasting corporation under accesstoinformation legislation opposition mps complained that several recommendations for accesstoinformation reform were omitted from the bill and were instead sent to committee for further review new democratic party mp pat martin suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future martin later made a deal with baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee in return for the conservatives accepting some ndp amendments information commissioner john reid criticized the new proposed powers for his department under the legislation arguing that they would create unnecessary bureaucracy shortly after the accountability act was introduced to parliament reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would increase the governments ability to cover up wrongdoing shield itself from embarrassment and control the flow of information to canadians he added that no government had ever put forward a more retrograde and dangerous set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws baird described reids criticisms as excessive stating that most of the commissioners specific concerns were minor in nature representatives of canadas business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors the bill passed the house of commons on division in june  the canadian senate approved it in december  with several amendments and sent it back to the commons for further consideration the amended act was approved by the commons without debate on december  and was signed into law four days later shortly after the bill first passed the commons baird acknowledged that the conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in  he told a senate committee that  million was left unreported and that he did not realize it was an issue at the time the matter is under review by the chief electoral officerwhen the conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the accountability act in november  stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions program cutsedit in may  baird was asked to find  billion in cuts for  and  on september  on the same day that the government announced a  billion surplus baird announced cuts to sixtysix federal programs including status of women medicinal marijuana research canadian museums adult literacy youth employment and social development and the british columbia pine beetle program one of the most controversial cuts was to the federal court challenges program which provided funding for canadians to pursue rights cases in the canadian court system baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that reflects the priorities of working families and that he just didnt think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the governments own laws in court in justifying cuts to adult literacy programs baird referenced his governments support for youth literacy and said weve got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact  ottawa municipal electionedit in early october  bairds department reviewed a promised  million grant to the city of ottawas lightrail expansion project for the otrain baird indicated that the government would keep the funding at least until the november election but added that the council elected in november would have the final say on the issue he also leaked details of the citys contact with the german firm siemens as a result the rail program became a focal issue in the  ottawa mayoral election and bairds opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome baird and ottawa mayor bob chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project and liberal mp navdeep bains asked the federal ethics commissioner to investigate bairds decision to release details of the private contract chiarelli was defeated in the election and the lightrail expansion was stopped by the new council an ottawa citizen report in january  revealed that federal officials had not posed any objections to the lightrail project before bairds intervention and suggested that his involvement was political in nature green party leader elizabeth may speculated that ottawa may have been deprived of lightrail service because of an apparent personal vendetta from baird against chiarelli baird denied this charge saying that his intervention was not political opponents of the lightrail project have argued that it was undertaken without sufficient consultation with the public in february  it was reported that the house of commons committee on government operations would be looking into his involvement over the case mp and committee member mark holland voiced a concern that baird leaked information on the contract baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying there is no evidence of anything speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation if you want to avert a billiondollar boondoggle you have to make some difficult decisions other responsibilitiesedit baird held ministerial responsibilities for the toronto harbourfront centre and the toronto waterfront revitalization corporation he developed a working relationship with toronto mayor david miller soon after his appointment and was present for the announcement of a

christmas  meeting with canadian soldiers in afghanistan environment minister –edit on january   baird was appointed as environment minister in a cabinet shuffle replacing rona ambrose in making the appointment prime minister stephen harper acknowledged that his government needed to do more to make the environment a priority some commentators remarked favourably on bairds appointment describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator columnist andrew coyne however described baird as the man sent to kill the issue suggesting that bairds appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms baird is a vocal opponent of the kyoto protocol which he argues will bring about an economic collapse later in  he added that any new environmental agreements must include reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as china india and the united states who have not signed the protocol or does not have any mandatory reductions set by the protocol baird met with renowned canadian environmentalist david suzuki following his appointment at the time suzuki said he was encouraged by bairds approach but remained skeptical of the harper governments environmental plans however when baird unveiled the conservative governments plan in april  suzuki confronted him calling the plan a disappointment approach to the kyoto protocoledit in february  the liberal opposition brought forward a nonbinding motion for canada to renew its commitment to the kyoto protocol all conservative mps who were present in the house including baird voted against the motion which passed with the support of the three opposition parties the following month opposition members on a special commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the governments clean air act among other things the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of kyoto targets baird indicated that the oppositions changes would not be included in federal targets or regulations in april  baird produced a federal study supported by five independent economists to support his approach to the kyoto protocol among the five economists was torontodominion bank chief economist don drummond who also wrote a private letter to baird arguing that the economic cost of implementing kyoto would be at least as deep as the recession in the early s opposition parliamentarians dismissed the report as a scare tactic while liberal environment critic david mcguinty argued that the study was misleading saying that it did not properly examine international emission trading and ignored jobs to be created through the green economy the report claimed that canadas ability to invest in developing nations to meet emissions targets through cdm by misquoting the amount of credit to be  million instead of the real approximation of  billion soon afterward a united nations report also contradicted the study mentioning that steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished at a cost of only  per cent of the worlds annual economic output but baird responded that canadas gas emission levels would peak in  three years before the uns set target of  environmental strategyedit baird was the harper governments representative at the release of a major united nations report on climate change in paris in february  he described the report as a turning point in the battle against climate change while indicating his surprise that human activity was found to be a major cause of the phenomenon baird released his governments targets for greenhouse gas emissions in late april  the plan calls for canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by  and for cuts to reach  by  under this plan canada will reach its kyoto targets between  and  taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than kyoto the government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps baird said that the plan strikes a balance between the perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect in december  baird revealed in a plan that over  bigpolluter companies including oil and gas pulp and paper electricity and iron and steel companies must cut greenhouse emissions by six percent between  and  the companies would also have to produce an annual report every may  that would include data regarding the level of greenhouses emissions produced each year bairds proposal has been met with approval from canadas oilpatch executives who described them as the toughest emission regulations in the world and who feared that more stringent standards would stifle oil sands exploration ontario premier dalton mcguinty had been considerably less critical than his brother federal liberal member of parliament david mcguinty having written to prime minister harper on the environmental policy the premier had stressed the importance of a policy that considered the north american market as a whole due to the automotive industrys importance to his province mcguinty said the conservatives environmental plan could have gone further but described the auto emissions part of the plan as very sensible members of opposition parties have criticized the governments abandonment of the kyoto goals while david suzuki described the proposal as a sham with weak targets former us vice president al gore said bairds plan was a complete and total fraud that was designed to mislead the canadian people baird responded by defending his plan and by criticizing gores environmental record noting that no similarly stringent measures were passed during gores tenure in office and that the kyoto treaty was never submitted to the us senate for ratification liberal party mp pablo rodriguez introduced to the house of commons a private bill that would have forced canada to comply with the kyoto treaty in response to the governments plan while the bill passed baird mentioned that even though that the government wouldnt dismiss the idea there were no new environmental measures planned all three opposition parties demanded that the environment become one of the main points of the governments throne speech in the  fall session environmental recordedit shortly after his appointment baird stephen harper and natural resources minister gary lunn announced  billion for cleanenergy initiatives over the next decade baird and lunn also announced a  million program for clean energy technology lunn said that there were literally hundreds of programs but there was no focus when the conservatives took office critics argued that the new conservative measures were similar to measures introduced by the liberals in their  budget former liberal leader stéphane dion has argued that the conservative partys strategy is too strongly focused on nuclear energy on february   baird appeared at a press conference with stephen harper and quebec premier jean charest to announce a  billion environmental fund for the provinces journalist frances russell criticized that as a reduction from the  billion promised by the previous liberal government canada is a signatory to the kyoto protocol which legally requires signatory countries to set up compatible carbon trading markets in direct defiance of this international legal obligation in march  baird indicated that he wanted canadian companies to be banned or at least severely restricted from participating in the international carbon market several european countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell credits on an international market many industry leaders argued that canada should adopt a similar policy thenopposition leader stéphane dion argued that participation will allow canadian firms to make megatonnes of money baird however described some carbon markets as shaky and argued that trade should be restricted to within canada or perhaps within north america in april he indicated that canadian businesses would soon gain the right to earn credits by investing in overseas environmental projects baird defended another conservative government decision to cut funds for climate science research arguing that further studies are largely superfluous in light of recent united nations reports gordon mcbean of the canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences has disagreed claiming that further research is the best way to adapt to a changing climate baird said in a house of commons committee that his government would not consider the implementation of a carbon tax he told that the governments approach will be to provide regulation for industry to ensure we reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollutants baliedit while participating at the united nations summit on climate changes in bali indonesia baird announced a  million funding to help canadian communities notably coping with the loss of forests due to pine beetles in the west and of infrastructures in the north due to softer soil

baird showed up for the bali conference at which it was intended he explain canadas position at a meeting with nongovernmental activists but instead quickly left with one of the activists alleging that baird left because he probably did not want to confront young activists critical of canadas stand draft baird movementedit in late november and early december  a website went online allegedly representing a movement to draft baird for leader of the conservative party in the face of stephen harper facing possible defeat by an opposition coalition the draft group allegedly comprised over  party members from across the country—including two mps and one senator who reportedly had requested anonymity in its only contact with the media the campaign claimed it had nearly  visitors and  new supporters in less than ten hourscitation needed baird indicated afterward not only that he was loyal to harper but that he was uninterested in ever becoming party leader in  he told a newspaper some people may have when growing up always harboured leadership ambitions ive never harboured leadership ambitions it is the honesttogod truth minister of transport –edit baird served as minister of

more than  leadingwhich international organizations go to countries that do the most to disrupt or undermine un climate talks canada under baird was accused of working against progressive legislation

politicians in ottawa john baird has succeeded in federal politics because of his ability energy intelligence work ethic — and strong relationship with the pm that has made him a cabinet favourite  tom hanson  the canadian press file photo  by linda diebelcanadasat aug  hes feisty lippy occasionally foulmouthed – as in f off toronto – and comes across as a red meateating conservative ideologue he also remembers birthdays knows how to listen doesnt eat meat and says hey cooool with the aplomb of a teenager circa john baird federal minister of transport infrastructure and communities is a complicated man fitting perhaps for one of the most powerful politicians in ottawa who holds a significant chunk of torontos future in the palm of his hand at the moment anywayhes the ice cream man the federal minister responsible for spreading some  billion in stimulus spending on infrastructure projects the conservative government hopes will put recessionary canada back to workwith such power lies great danger article continued belowhow baird handles the distribution of the money including  millionplus expected for toronto could well determine how canadians view the conservatives at election time – possibly as early as fallthe key thing is getting the money out the door and getting the work done says liberal consultant bob richardson a friend of bairds for  years thats what canadians want to know did he get it done if the answers yes then great if no youve got big problems for the governmenta fall election likely would be too soon for any comprehensive review of the spending plan but not too soon for communities across the country to have a good sense of how well the money is flowing if torontos any indication things may not go well baird recently rejected the citys proposal to pump stimulus funds into new streetcars because their completion date fell outside the programs early  deadline his frustration with mayor david miller led to the infamous epithet and it must be noted a hasty and full apologyjohn is playing a critical role for the government says richardson of course finance minister jim flahertys a heavyweight but bairds the guy with his hand on the infrastructure spigot thats a top issue – if not the top issue across the country richardson addshows that for pressure on john russell baird rusty to his palsprobably nothing too overwhelming at  hes the former boy wonder who quickly morphed into prime minister stephen harpers mr fixit after the conservatives won their first minority in early  harper named baird to the presidency of the frontline treasury board then parachuted him into the environment portfolio to relieve a faltering rona ambrose aka harpers pit bull he took on new liberal leader stéphane dion when dion was seen as the green saviour of canadian politics hows he done it ability energy intelligence and a solid work ethic sure but hes also close to the boss arguably baird is harpers cabinet favourite a leader seen as prickly and aloof is described by baird as sharing a strong relationship with him we have great discussions we debate ideas all the timefriends and colleagues applaud sharp political skills for his rocket ride in federal politicsjohn baird was one of the people who supported stephen harper before a lot of other people figured it out says jaime watt a conservative political strategist and another longtime baird friend baird cochaired harpers  bid for the new conservative partys leadership and that same year played a similar role in the federal election in which the liberals won a minorityi liked harper i believed in a new conservative party i thought it was unhealthy for canada not to have a real opposition and i got behind him very early in the province says baird then he took a risk by  hed been a prominent mpp and cabinet minister from the ottawaarea riding of nepeancarleton for  years a safe and comfy seat nevertheless he resigned and ran federally in the much more volatile ottawa westnepean riding john has extraordinary political instincts says ontario progressive conservative leader tim hudak when he made the leap to federal politics many more cautious people recommended he stay put at queens park they didnt see stephen harper emerging as anything special on the national level other mpps whod been headhunted by the conservatives thought the liberals would be in power in ottawa for a very long timea gutsy move no question but it was no secret baird also a favourite of former premier mike harris the guys got a knack didnt get along with new leader ernie eves it was personal say colleagues and went beyond evess annoyance over bairds early support for flaherty in the leadership race moreover by  the conservatives were out of power in queens parktheres more with harper the pm values loyalty and baird is the dictionary definition of the word of his early support for harpers leadership baird says i wasnt a member of caucus trying to position myself for the future and so there was a lot of trust in our relationship from the beginninghe knows im loyalpolitics is brutal a royal court of intrigue colleagues wait in the wings sniffing for that first whiff of blood not baird nobody interviewed sees him as a schemer only canadian chamber of commerce president perrin beatty who hired student baird political science queens when he was communications minister cautioned one shouldnt rule that out as a possibility at some time in his career  but hes not consumed with the desire to be prime ministerbaird is blunt i dont have any plans i think some people probably think about that i dontsources say harper doesnt see baird as a threat if baird ever were to think about running it would be on harpers timetable and with his counsel and blessingbaird should be able to count on laureen harper described as funny charming and a bon vivant by friends he often escorts the pms wife to events in the capitalmrs harper is fantastic says baird we get along finetall husky and looking fit baird sat down with the toronto star on a muggy toronto afternoon at an outdoor café he lived near queens park for a decade loves the city and waves often to passersby who spot the familiar dudley doright jutting jaw hes not into sports oh god no says watt loves fast food and his weight goes up and down like a seesaw hes recently dropped pounds by eschewing carbs he doesnt so much laugh as cackle and hes funny if not always intentionally so since he was  his big passion in life was to be an mpp at queens park trulywhy he doesnt really know his dads favourite uncle russell boucher was an ottawaarea mp in the s but thats not it i just thought that would be a really cool thingsays richardson thats off the nerd meterbaird was born and raised in nepean his parents gerald and marianne divorced when he was  he has one sister and lived alternately with each parentat  and in grade  french immersion at d aubrey moodie school

in a nepean townhouse characterized by richardson as a permanent bachelor pad with his grey tabby thatcher whats the cat like exactly like mrs thatcher says richardson of the former frosty british pmone of the things thats special about john is how he treats his friends says watt you know when you are friends with a politician youre going to have to do the bulk of the work but hes different he shares the heavy lifting  he knows how to nurture friendshipsfriends bristle when hes described as a loudmouthed hothead too often just screaming his head off in the house of commons looking wild as one political observer puts it but opponents dont always grasp that his tongue is supposed to be in cheek baird cites ndp leader jack layton as proof he works well across the political spectrum layton isnt so sure he called olivia and me a twoheaded monster responds layton referring to his wife new democrat mp olivia chow maybe it was in jest but it felt pretty personalchow who represents trinityspadina may turn out to be bairds nemesis in his recent challenge she doesnt buy the argument toronto should have been able to match other cities in getting the spending criteria right from the beginning in a democratic society it should be up to the municipality to decide how it wants to spend the money she says chow is helping to organize a public protest against baird later this summer
