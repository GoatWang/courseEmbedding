customary opening remarks from greg including comments about our recently announced agreement to acquire synventive molding solutions followed by a more detailed review of quarterly results and an updated outlook discussion by chris after that we will open up the call for questions at this time i will turn the call over to barnes groups president and ceo greg milzcik gregory f milzcik thanks bill and good morning barnes group delivered expanded operating income and improved margins in each of our segments during the second quarter in a business environment which remains uncertain and cautious we believe these conditions will prevail for an extended period of time and we are adapting to the climate revenues in the quarter were impacted by a number of factors including foreign exchange loss planned attrition of underperforming accounts in our distribution business and an ongoing economic conditions however we expect improved performance in the second half of  based on our current orders trends and existing backlog net sales of  million were down  from last year although organic sales growth was up modestly in our  manufacturing segments aerospace and industrial we saw a  sequential growth and a  yearoveryear growth in backlog total backlog for barnes group is now at a record  million up more than  million from last years second quarter before my usual operating review i would like to say a few words regarding our recently announced agreement to acquire synventive molding solutions our largest acquisition ever please refer to slide  of our earnings supplement synventive is a leading designer and manufacturer of highly engineered and customized solutions components and services with a complex injection molding applications and is an excellent strategic fit for barnes group we expect global demand for synventives products and services to grow substantially in the future adding a suite of products and solutions for customers and this market is expected to speed our global growth and enhance our profitability it possesses intellectual propertybased capabilities which provide us with an exceptional opportunity to establish a new growth platform one that includes highly engineered solutions a leading market position a stronger global presence and solid profitability in addition the teams and corporate cultures at both barnes group and synventive are closely aligned sharing the same values in terms of business practices lean manufacturing techniques and technological innovations in the product systems and services that we bring into market later in our prepared remarks chris will touch upon some of the additional details of this transaction now turning our attention back to our secondquarter performance in aerospace what we see reflects much of the same observations coming out of the recent farnborough air show as well as the recent commentary from several industry participants our aerospace business reflects the general outlook for commercial aviation strong orders for our original equipment manufacturing business go back up  yearoveryear to a record  million this certainly telegraphs a stronger second half as the rampup in the aircraft production moves forward we feel confident that commercial aircraft production over the next several years should show meaningful growth continued strong orders taken by aircraft manufacturers along with the introduction of new aircraft technologies provide additional data points to support this belief we feel were on the right aircraft platforms and we continue our efforts to secure additional content on both existing and future aircraft platforms our aftermarket business saw a  yearoveryear growth in maintenance repair and overhaul or mro sales reflecting sustained demand as well as new process introductions however soft spare part sales reflect inventory compression particularly in europe commentary from a number of market participants mirrored the soft demand for spare parts although an expected stronger second half in  is still prevalent industrial sales declined in the second quarter as a result of the economic environment combined with an unfavorable foreign exchange impact our nitrogen gas products business generated doubledigit volume growth and strong order intake and as for associated spring performance improved yearoveryear as several productivity initiatives helped us expand margins orders were up  at associated spring and the forecast for north american light vehicle production for  has improved to  million units another positive sign our distribution segment saw sales increase slightly over last year while operating profit and margins both improved profitability benefits derived from a sustained emphasis on productivity and the planned attrition of certain underperforming accounts while the latter does negatively influence sales growth it has contributed meaningfully to better flowthrough in our north american distribution business we saw daily sales average or dsa continue to improve thats now  consecutive quarters of yearoveryear dsa growth we are watching closely the overall economic environment in barnes distribution north americas key markets and we have noticed the monthly ism index dipped below  for the first time in nearly  years although the second quarter average remained above  signifying growth junes numbers is one point in time and well certainly be attentive to trends in our customer ordering pattern to see if theres any effect on our ability to grow the businesses further to conclude our second quarter results demonstrated the ongoing emphasis to enhance profitability across our business in spite of a sales shortfall we delivered increased operating income and margins our secondhalf outlook remain positive and we expect to further margin improvements and solid eps growth for  lastly i look forward to welcoming synventives management team and highly skilled workforce to barnes group we are excited about the prospect of having such a highquality business in our portfolio now let me turn the call over to chris for some of the financial details over the quarter chris christopher j stephens thanks greg let me begin our discussion this morning by highlighting the key points made on slide  of the earnings release supplement which is available on our website net sales decreased  to  million while overall organic sales were up  in the second quarter after you adjust for a  unfavorable impact of fx operating income increased  to  million and as greg mentioned operating margins improved in each of our  segments for bgi operating margin improved  basis points to  reflecting our ongoing focus on driving profitable sales growth and productivity eps from continuing operations was up  to  per diluted share which compares to  per share from last years second quarter i would like to highlight that even though eps was up  for the quarter we did incur additional costs for aggressively pursuing ma deals not of all  not all of which have materialized this negatively impacted eps by about  in the quarter now let me discuss a few details on the quarter and then i will wrap up with comments on our updated guidance and the synventive transaction in our aerospace segment net sales of  million were down  from last year a slight increase in original equipment manufacturing sales continued strong sales in our aftermarket repair and overhaul activity were offset by a sales decline in our aftermarket spare parts business our aerospace oem business generated significant increase in order activity which drove the meaningful yearoveryear increase in backlog from  million last year to  million this year that represents a  increase as a reminder while backlog is a helpful indicator sales can be affected by a number of factors over time including insourcing decisions material changes production schedules and volumes of specific programs to name a few at industrial second quarter sales of  million decreased  driven by the negative impact of fx while organic sales were up  and in our distribution segment sales were  million up slightly from the second quarter of last year turning now to operating profit at aerospace operating profit decreased  to  million driven by the profit impact of lower sales and a shift in sales mix operating margins improved slightly to  up  basis points industrial operating profit increased  to  million as the result of the profit impact from higher organic sales at some of our industrial businesses and overall lower employeerelated incentive compensation partially offset by increased pension expense operating margins improved  basis points to  operating profit at distribution increased  to  million while margins improved  basis points to  a reduction in employeerelated incentive compensation and further productivity improvements contributed to the expansion and were partially offset by higher pension expense as a reminder when we provided initial full year guidance for  we highlighted the fact that pension expense was going to increase approximately  million from  for reporting purposes this increase is primarily reflected in our industrial and distribution segments with respect to taxes the companys effective tax rate for the second quarter of  was  compared to  in the second quarter of  last years secondquarter effective tax rate included the recognition of  million of discrete tax expense related to tax adjustments for prior years regarding share count our secondquarter average diluted outstanding share count was  million thats down  from last year and in the second quarter we repurchased  shares under the authority of our boardapproved  repurchase program of  million shares at the end of june  we have  million shares remaining under this program but with the anticipated closing of the synventive acquisition we do not expect to repurchase additional shares over the remainder of  turning now to cash flow in the first half of  operating activities generated cash flow of  million versus  million in the first half of last years reflecting improved operating performance offset by higher cash payments for  employeerelated incentive compensation and increased contributions to the companys pension plan  yeartodate free cash flow reflects a lower level of capital expenditures as compared to last year which is a function of timing we still expect fullyear capex to be in the range of  million to  million up from  million in  lets now discuss our updated  financial guidance on slide  of our supplement this updated guidance excludes the impact of the announced synventive acquisition we now expect lower revenue growth of  to  due to the effect of fx given the stronger dollar and lower aerospace spare parts sales in the first half of the year operating margins are forecasted to be approximately  while earnings from continuing operations per diluted share are now expected to be in the range of  to  up  to  from  and for the full year we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately  key factors in our  guidance range includes the following for the upper end of the range we would benefit from stronger aerospace spare parts sales in the second half of the year better margin leverage or flowthrough on increased sales and incremental productivity gains given our focus on lean quality and cost management at the lower end of the range we would be negatively impacted by a slowdown in the global economy a steeperthananticipated decline in european industrial activity and further strengthening of the us dollar with respect to the announced synventive acquisition we expect their fullyear  revenues to be approximately  million additionally with synventives anticipated ebitda margins higher than barnes groups we expect to see an improvement in our total ebitda margins the transaction is expected to be dilutive to  earnings per share due to the impact of purchase accounting and accretive to  as mentioned this transaction is expected to be financed with cash on hand and additional borrowing from the companys credit agreement and is anticipated to close in august of  so to wrap up my prepared remarks our sustained focus on driving productivity improving operating leverage and strengthening our balance sheet has allowed barnes group to expand profitably during the quarter these efforts have positioned barnes group to capitalize on new opportunities such as the announcement of the synventive acquisition and are expected to drive longterm shareholder value operator we will now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of peter lisnic with baird peter lisnic  robert w baird  co incorporated research division i guess chris if we could start off a little bit with synventive and give us a little bit of history there just wondering kind of what the growth profile has looked like over the years and maybe if we could discuss peak and trough revenue and ebitda profiles that would be very helpful for us gregory f milzcik im going to butt in here peter since we have not yet closed on this business theres little we can share with you on some of this information i think that after the close which we expect in august we will have followup information that will be able to clear up many of your questions peter lisnic  robert w baird  co incorporated research division okay is it  you did mention that the ebitda profile here is higher than the current barnes portfolio is it safe to say that that would be the case if you look at previous peaks and previous troughs christopher j stephens i would say as we looked at the past several years during the due diligence process we clearly recognize the value that synventive has been able to provide over the past year or  and when you think about that being an attractive addition to barnes group we do see that ebitda margin improvement expected post close peter lisnic  robert w baird  co incorporated research division okay all right and then if i could switch gears a bit to the aerospace piece of the portfolio it looks like the oem business decelerated a bit from a growth comp perspective from first quarter second quarter if i have my numbers right can you give us gregory f milzcik youre right peter lisnic  robert w baird  co incorporated research division okay any reason why that would happen gregory f milzcik just the timing of the deliveries the thing that was disappointing in the quarter as far as top line our industrial business performed about what we expected given the foreign exchange issues we expected some intentional attrition at our distribution business so that was pretty much the same the thing that was a little disappointing was the aerospace sales why im not worried is basically because the backlog has swelled when we look at the profile for the balance of the year i think were going to see that driving sequential improvement throughout the year so if i were to profile the earnings through the year it would be an improvement in third quarter and fourth quarter sequentially so its a little different than what the current profile looks like on the street right now peter lisnic  robert w baird  co incorporated research division okay got it and then last question just you mentioned inventory correction in the spares business is that essentially done have you saw  did you see incremental takedown of inventory in july kind of where are we at on the inventory situation there gregory f milzcik no we think were there and this largely comes out of ges conference call that was held recently where they pointed out that there was a correction of spares in europe we saw that reflected in our business as well so most of the people who participate in the spare parts market have seen that in the first half of the year were hopeful but at the same time were also looking at it a little differently revenue sharing program as a percentage of our overall profit is not as great as it used to be as the rest of the businesses are improving we dont think that its the big driver that it had been in the past and going forward we think its going to be a smaller portion of our overall profitability as well operator our next question comes from the line of edward marshall with sidoti  company edward marshall  sidoti  company llc so what  i know you mentioned existing backlog you also mentioned the pace of orders i mean what gives you confidence that youre going to see the backhalf acceleration that the guidance implies its  yearoveryear even at the bottom end of the range your  or rather second half versus half in eps range even at the bottom end of the range so is it what slated to be shipped in the second half that you see in your backlog is that what youre saying gregory f milzcik exactly when we do our detailed quarterly reviews and we also look at everything from the delivery cycle et cetera and the easiest thing to forecast in our business portfolio is the aerospace oe side of the business because it is a long cycle from order backlog delivery so we feel pretty confident that the year will unfold the way we expect aerospace is about half of the profitability of barnes group historically so it is a driver going to the back half of the year and it is certainly going to change the profile that was traditionally firsthalf heavy versus backhalf we see the back half being bigger this year basically as we enter the ramp and i think the ramp is real and its going to happen for several more years edward marshall  sidoti  company llc is it related to the  out of curiosity i mean knowing that engine has some pretty good yearoveryear growth already gregory f milzcik yes both  and  are for us are some of the key drivers we also have some other work here and there thats driving the improvement in backlog so were pretty happy with the package that we have and the profile of the platforms that were on it looks pretty robust ive been in aerospace for a very long time and i havent seen a commercial aerospace outlook this bright in my whole career edward marshall  sidoti  company llc i know chris mentioned spares outperforming could get you to the high end of the range my expectation is that your  you dont expect that to happen you would assume thats relatively flat from here gregory f milzcik well thats what we built into thats why i took the top end down and in order to get back above the range it would have to be some pretty robust sales growth but at the same time were trying to be as accurate as possible were not trying to underestimate or overestimate and we dont guestimate this stuff we do a very detailed buildup and look a the macroeconomic conditions and make sure that we think we have something thats solid we dont want to keep changing guidance edward marshall  sidoti  company llc point of clarity the top end of the range i think  i mean rather the revenue guidance was  to  growth are you referring to organic growth gregory f milzcik yes edward marshall  sidoti  company llc okay so not including synventive which could add additional what lets say  million to  million of sales for the year gregory f milzcik right right and thats with the fx christopher j stephens yes i would add fx  the impact of fx as well as organic growth in the business but it does not include synventive at this point edward marshall  sidoti  company llc it includes your fx expectations as well gregory f milzcik exactly christopher j stephens right edward marshall  sidoti  company llc okay and then finally the aerospace backlog did you give out a number i missed it gregory f milzcik the aerospace backlog was christopher j stephens on the oem side gregory f milzcik yes its  and christopher j stephens  million gregory f milzcik  million christopher j stephens on the oem side edward marshall  sidoti  company llc  million christopher j stephens  million right edward marshall  sidoti  company llc okay and that was  million last quarter if im right gregory f milzcik it was  million   million was all of aerospace so weve got some mro work in there so youve got  all of  overall aerospace was  million last quarter and  million this quarter edward marshall  sidoti  company llc so we saw a significant pickup and i guess thats whats youre referring to in your guidance christopher j stephens yes gregory f milzcik exactly its not only sequential but its yearoveryear and its a very bright picture its going to be a strong second half at least we expect it operator our next question comes from the line of matt summerville with keybanc matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division a couple of questions first on the aero oem side what sort of yearoveryear growth rate did you experience in the first half of the year and what yearoveryear growth rate do you expect to see in the second half to help us kind of think through this gregory f milzcik on the second quarter we had  it was just about  and i think christopher j stephens yes the second quarter was  for the first half of the year it was actually up  so we expect that to improve as greg mentioned in his comments sequentially increasing quartertoquarter third quarter and fourth quarter so we expect a stronger second half matt on the oem deliveries matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division i want to make sure i have one of the numbers correct that you provided you said aftermarket overhaul and repair was up  is that the correct number christopher j stephens it is yes gregory f milzcik thats correct but its also  not just market we have been investing heavily in new process or new product introduction so thats a combination number it does exceed many of the current numbers out in the marketplace but it does not include spares so i think that its a good sign in some ways that there is aftermarket activity although the mro market for the past several years has been confusing to say the least matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division if you try and parse that then greg maybe you can talk about some platforms where you have aftermarket content now that you did not in the past and maybe how much of the  do you think is being driven by your own sort of internal push in that business gregory f milzcik a lot of it is the rollsroyce product line the trents in particular and i think that as we go forward were going to continue to see that strong relationship with rollsroyce continue to expand but we also have invested in a variety of cfm overhaul work and things of that nature so weve been paying a lot of attention to the demographics of the fleet out in the field and investing where it makes sense matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division so then if mro was up  how much was the spares business down gregory f milzcik we dont break it out but it was significant matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division how much was total aftermarket down christopher j stephens matt total aftermarket was basically down maybe  to  it was not a significant decrease so youve got a combination of the mro strength offset by spare parts softness as we commented matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division okay and then if we can move over to industrial for a moment so in the quarter can you talk about at associated spring how much that business grew organically versus production just trying to get a feel for where youre at with content there and market share and then what your experience was in your european auto businesses and then maybe speak to both how youre thinking about the second half gregory f milzcik well first we dont go so granular in the industrial businesses as that but i could basically say that in general we had good growth in north america there was some sluggishness in brazil in particular associated spring has little in europe as far as automotive content but our european manufacturing business when you adjust for local currency was up with the exception of our lower differentiated businesses that are autoorientated they were impacted by a slower growth of auto in europe matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division so what are your thoughts on the back half and i guess what have the incoming order rates been telling you with lets say nitrogen gas with seeger and maybe with your hänggi business gregory f milzcik well first of all nitrogen gas products is really booming its going nicely there are so many promising things going on at heinz hänggi that i dont want to get into but im very happy with the direction were heading there and seeger has been impacted because they have a fair amount of domestic auto content and it is the lower margin of the  businesses so it does have a minimal effect on the overall matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division so then netnet youre seeing favorable mix shift has the capacity constraints youve had in nitrogen gas been fully alleviated at this point gregory f milzcik yes and i can tell you im really thrilled with the way the team performed there when youre doing  its not quite a greenfield but close to building a plant expansion of that magnitude et cetera its been managed extremely well it has hit all the targets capital equipment was purchased early et cetera so were expecting that to be part of the second half recovery is the fact that were going to be seeing the insourcing of work that was previously outsourced and i think that weve alleviated the capacity issue matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division has some of that benefit already  did we see that in the margin in q already or not gregory f milzcik no no because the building has just been completed and the equipment is going in matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division and then just lastly i understand that you cant give particulars on the synventive in terms of financials but can you talk at a high level about the market size the addressable market the competitive landscape in the industry that you are looking to get into here patrick j dempsey yes matt this is patrick dempsey just to talk about hot runner marketplace overall the injection molding industry is estimated to be about  billion within that the global hot runner marketplace is estimated to be approximately  billion so clearly lots of room for expansion as it pertains to synventive which as you know specializes in the design and manufacture of custom hot runner systems in terms of the value proposition that synventive brings to the marketplace its one of the lowest total cost of ownership across the platform life cycle and so in that the unique technology that synventive brings to the marketplace reduces downtime reduces scrap lower failure rates and increased faster cycle times matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division i was just going to ask in terms of  you mentioned  sales are roughly  million so well just round and say synventive has roughly  of this  billion addressable market i guess where would that sort of rank them competitively and who are some of the other players that we should be thinking about in this space patrick j dempsey okay from a competitive standpoint what i would highlight is that the market for hot runners is highly fragmented and subsequently it features competitors with varying capabilities scope scale and expertise and the majority of competitors compete in niche applications andor geographies the great thing about synventive is that its one of the few global players in the industry but to give you some examples of competitors where theres some overlap it would include companies such as udall ph moldmasters inco ph as examples operator our next question comes from the line of bhupender bohra with jefferies bhupender bohra just following up on the question which was asked before on synventive just wanted to get your thinking what actually you thought when you made this acquisition what was the thinking behind this and just want to fit into industrial segment if you can just give us some color on will this be like an expansion platform for you guys or how its going to benefit like synergies on the top line and gregory f milzcik right exactly if youve been looking at our investor presentation over the past couple of years weve been telegraphing this exact type of move were looking at increasing our differentiation both organically and through acquisition so when we look at the overall industry were looking for things that have growing markets for example and in this particular case not only is global auto growing but plastic as a percentage of content is growing so you have a double overlap thats a nice place to be leading positions we found businesses that are leaders in particular niche areas tend to have higher profit margins and are being our price leaders significant intellectual property as a differentiator and also a barrier to entry leads to higher margins global access is one of the things that we really looked at because we think that the markets will grow faster outside of western europe and north america and some level of cyclical moderation so when we look at all those things and bring it to bear on synventive it really fits in nicely with our overall strategy where were going forward and as patrick mentioned it is a fractured market and in that sense that there is probably room to have additional acquisitive growth as well as continued investment in the business for longterm organic growth as well bhupender bohra okay so are you going to  i mean right now the business that you have is like the hot runner right synventive actually does that gregory f milzcik right hot runner yes bhupender bohra yes will that expand to like making molding machines or gregory f milzcik i wouldnt go that far what were looking at is focusing on this market we think that theres good investment that we can make in that business and i want to reemphasize that we are not making parts this is a system that supports an industry that manufactures parts and this is also a capital item rather than an expense item so theres a variety of things in the business model that are attractive compared to other businesses and i would say that its similar to our nitrogen gas products business in that sense where nitrogen gas products doesnt make parts they make systems and components that go into the tool and die industry again a capital item and we like that model bhupender bohra okay the next question you gave a number aftermarket actually totally  total aftermarket declined  to  thats for the first half or the second quarter christopher j stephens that would be second quarter bhupender bohra second quarter now on top of that actually you said for the second half if you need to achieve your higher end of the guidance something needs to happen on the spare parts it needs to grow or  i dont know if you can just give some color on what needs to happen in spare parts actually for you to achieve gregory f milzcik i think if the inventory destocking is over as we expect we should be able to see increased back half year sales and theres only so far you can go with destocking i think that theres a lot of stress in european economy which is driving the cash conservation associated with the destocking so im not overly worried about it and as i mentioned before rsps as a percentage of our overall profitability have declined so i think that were in pretty good shape bhupender bohra okay are we done with destocking or we still have it in front of us gregory f milzcik well we cant confirm it but we believe its mostly done operator our next question comes from the line of holden lewis with bbt capital markets holden lewis  bbt capital markets research division as it relates to sort of your  margin goal as im sort of looking at how the year is playing out i mean obviously through the first half you werent there so youre kind of expecting the i guess sequential improvement in the operating margin in the second half but when you look at sort of your distribution and industrial business correct me if im wrong in this assumption but the combination of seasonality and weaker markets might suggest that the q margin might be sort of the peak for those  businesses which then suggests that theres going to be some real heavy lifting done in aerospace and can you do that if spares are flat or do you really require spares to get better and influence the mix in order to make that  gregory f milzcik no were heading in the right direction actually when i look at the numbers were doing exactly what we said we would do we said that a high upper single digit for distribution which is were at what  or something like that we said that wed be low to  or mid to upper teens for aerospace and we still believe that and thats where its at right now and we said low double digit for industrial which is where were at i think theyre all going to improve for varying reasons one is some of the expenses in distribution that were in the first half and some of the attrition is going to dissipate in the back half of the year so we expect that to continue to improve we also expect with nitrogen gas products leading the way in the back half of the year thats going to continue to help improve the industrial business associated spring in it  that mix is continuing to see rampup of auto production so were looking at some expansion there theres also productivity initiatives and  but we clearly expect the aerospace to lead the way as far as the back half of the year holden lewis  bbt capital markets research division okay and again assuming spares dont come back and maybe they do and if they do that would obviously be beneficial just to the aerospace mix but youve sort of been in this ish kind of range for a while on the aerospace if you  what kind of incremental margins or what kind of stepup in the margin would you expect to see if its just the oem backlog flowing through and spares dont contribute or if spares dont contribute youre looking at a kind of a  type of margin gregory f milzcik it should improve about  with the increased flowthrough from oe side i dont see a problem as i mentioned since  weve had the management fees nipping at the rsp percentage which drives down the margin so theres not a applestoapples comparison there but at the same time the rest of the business as a percentage of the profitability has improved significantly so i think going forward were going to be pretty comfortable with that  between mid teens and upper teens regardless of the mix holden lewis  bbt capital markets research division okay and what costs have burdened sort of the first half in distribution that you think could slide away in the second half gregory f milzcik there were just some investments that were made in a variety different areas and its not a huge magnitude but at the same time i think its going to improve in the back half of the year holden lewis  bbt capital markets research division okay and then in the industrial what kind of impact do you think this insourcing could have but maybe i dont know if you can give us some sense of what benefit you think it will have or maybe what the decrement has been to date from outsourcing but whats kind of the magnitude of impact there christopher j stephens yes holden this is chris i would just say like we talked about for overall industrial nitrogen gas products had the firsthalf pressure of insourcing so well get the second half benefit of  outsourcing i mean in terms of pressure of outsourcing and then insourcing given the fact that weve added to the facilities and capacitized accordingly we would expect that to continue to improve so overall industrial margins to be in that low doubledigit we continue to drive for margin expansion in that business so thats what the secondhalf improvement should look like operator our next question comes from the line of christopher glynn with oppenheimer christopher glynn  oppenheimer  co inc research division just going to try a little bit more on synventive could you offer us some sort of order of magnitude of the ebitda margin relative to yours andor any color on the multiple christopher j stephens hey its chris first of all it doesnt hurt trying gregory f milzcik ill just chime in until we close this business were really not going to comment too far other than to say that we did not pay an extraordinary number low or high we paid basically the market for good quality business christopher glynn  oppenheimer  co inc research division okay and then you mentioned employeerelated compensation benefits a couple of times are there any freezes in response to the economic environment in place gregory f milzcik no no freezes this is just a  last year we had a terrific year and you think about just from an incentive comp bonus payout weve had the organizer across bgi we just really did exceptionally well as we look to this year continue to track to our plan profile as reflected in our guidance  to  so youre getting that comp benefit but i would just say  was just a blowout year for barnes group christopher glynn  oppenheimer  co inc research division makes sense and then just lastly the fx how does that play on industrial operating margin does that give you like upward christopher j stephens yes no significant difference at all actually on the op margin line operator our next question is a followup that comes from the line of matt summerville with keybanc capital markets matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division just a couple of followups early on in the third quarter greg have you seen any change in ill call it  and this is a question on distribution netting out what youre deliberately letting attrit have you seen a deceleration or a reversion into negative territory sequentially on the dsa there gregory f milzcik no actually our dsa has improved for  consecutive quarters our flowthrough is better than expected im pretty happy with the direction were going the one comment i will have that is an indicator that ill throw out for distribution even though that our numbers are good theyre heading the right direction i think the overall markets continuing to improve although slowly is the average order size decline even though dsa improved and thats indicative of a more cautious customer when the order size is reduced that means theyre doing a little bit of destocking themselves or reducing their inventory levels to meet the end demand so thats the only other color i could give you on that but other than that the dsa continues to improve matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division thats an interesting data point when you see a shift in the ism and again i know  month doesnt make a trend but i dont necessarily think its going over  next month do you typically see the dsa react first or the average order size like youre talking about here is there a historical pattern to call on here gregory f milzcik thats a great question but i think im going to have to defer that because i dont know matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division okay and then lastly  or maybe second to the last the backlog in nitrogen gas can you give some sort of qualitative color on that and if were thinking about things continuing to grind along or slow in europe things maybe not quite as robust in north america how do you  are you cautious at all about bringing that new capacity online as the macro environment is kind of shaky here gregory f milzcik not at all and the primary reason is first of all they have a very small backlog their delivery cycle is much shorter than aerospace so we really dont track backlog in that sense its a much smaller bucket but second of all their orders are very strong they continue to be strong what were seeing is anything thats exportdriven or capital budget its not really being affected that much and a lot of their product though is  its a global business so even with synventive one of the things that attracts is the global aspect of the business it protects us from particular geographies and the downturn and nitrogen gas products is just a great business and theyre a great team over there matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division how much on the top line should we kind of think about modeling in for the deliberate attrition youre letting occur in distribution for the full year gregory f milzcik i dont think we have given that out in the past but its roughly  of sales something like that on an annualized basis but again like i said i think that if you look at the profile for the remainder of the year were going to see eps growth sequentially both in third and fourth quarter and its a little different than the profile thats out there currently matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division and then just  this is my last question on the aftermarket spares business as you moved through the second quarter and what youve seen thus far in q do you really get the sense that your incoming order rates have bottomed have you seen any inflection at this point or is that something that you feel is still out in front of you yet gregory f milzcik no but i wouldnt expect it at this time because in the summer it typically is a low and aircraft are most active flying people around on vacation typically they start to look at bringing aircraft down after labor day and theyll preorder based on their numbers later into august so i wouldnt expect to be able to define anything at this point so im not excited one way or another operator our next question is a followup that comes from the line of holden lewis with bbt capital markets holden lewis  bbt capital markets research division can you guys  i understand that from a pricing standpoint youre probably seeing an increase in pricing distribution from attrition and then theres some questions i guess about maybe content and things like that in aerospace but can you just give a broad sense now that conditions seem to be softening at least in your industrial business of what youre seeing in price does that seem firm is there some downward wiggle there how are we looking at pricing going forward gregory f milzcik the odd thing we arent having that much of a pricing effect and ive been saying that for several years now that the one big surprise ive had through the economic crisis as well as the followon is we havent seen major pricing pressure and its still confusing to me but i think a lot of it has to do with availability et cetera but we get the normal stuff but nothing extraordinary holden lewis  bbt capital markets research division okay and then how long do you expect the distribution attrition to go on kind of at this level i mean are we at the point where weve kind of done it or its just something where its going to keep on going and so margins will continue to benefit because the mix is going to continue to skew towards more profitable business how should we look at the timing of that gregory f milzcik yes it should be the back half of the year should start to dissipate so the comps yearoveryear will be improving operator ladies and gentlemen since there are no further questions in queue id now like to turn the call over to mr william pitts for closing remarks william pitts thank you operator well we want to thank everybody for joining us this morning on the call we
