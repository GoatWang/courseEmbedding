securities advisor today best execution skip to content menu our firm our approach our services our team igpc contact us client login best execution best execution best execution  caldwell securities ltd is committed to use all reasonable efforts to ensure that clients achieve the best execution of their orders to buy or sell canadian listed securities that are quoted or traded on canadian marketplaces “best execution” is a brokerage’s obligation to seek the best terms reasonably available when executing a transaction on behalf of a client including factors such as speed of transaction execution price price improvement opportunities and liquidity  with the introduction of alternative trading systems atss in canada it is now possible for the same security to be traded on multiple markets caldwell securities has prepared this information sheet to inform you about this new trading environment  understanding the structure of the canadian marketplace  the canadian equity market is composed of multiple trading centres including traditional exchanges and alternative trading systems  a canadian exchanges  exchanges are marketplaces that may list the securities of issuers provide a guarantee of a twosided market for a security on a continuous basis and set requirements governing the conduct of marketplace participants the current equity exchanges in canada are  toronto stock exchange tsx  tsx venture exchange tsxv  canadian securities exchange cse  b alternative trading systems atss  atss provide automated trading systems which bring together orders from buyers and sellers of securities which are listed by any of the above exchanges the current equity atss in canada are  alpha ats  chix canada  pure trading operated by cse  omega ats all canadian equity orders placed through caldwell securities are directed for marketplace execution using the smart order routing technology smart routers seek the best price across all exchanges and visible ats simultaneously and fill as much of the order as possible with the unfilled portion of the order being booked on the default exchange caldwell securities has chosen the tsx as its default exchange as it has the highest volume of orders in its book caldwell securities does not subscribe to any dark pools marketplaces that offer no pretrade transparency on any orders as our trading volume is adequately met by the exchanges and ats noted above caldwell securities continually monitors its order routing choices pursuant to its regulatory obligation to ensure that such choices satisfy best execution of client orders  hours of operation for trading in canadian listed securities  caldwell securities trading staff and systems are available for order execution between  am est and  pm et “hours of operation” monday through friday excluding canadian statutory holidays staff may be available outside of principal marketplace hours however trade execution outside of the hours of operation is treated on a best efforts basis  standard handling of orders  all orders received for exchangelisted securities will be handled as follows  preopen  an order received prior to the hours of operation will book to the preopening of the default marketplace defined for that security  continuous session  an order received during the hours of operation will be handled as follows  an active order is defined as any portion of a market order or a limit price order which is immediately tradable based on current market conditions an active order will be entered into the marketplace with the best price at the time of execution where best price is the highest bid for a sell order or the lowest offer for a buy order all exchanges and visible atss are evaluated for best price when executing active orders  a passive order is defined as the unfilled balance of an active order or any limit price order which is not immediately executable passive orders are booked to the default marketplace for that security  changes to an outstanding order or portion of an outstanding order will be handled the same as a new order received with an active order reevaluated for best price execution across all exchanges and visible atss and a passive order rebooked based on the description above postclose  an order received after the hours of operation will be entered to the preopening of the default exchange defined for that security on the following business day  order execution  certain types of orders have specific handling implications in a multiple marketplace environment these have been addressed as follows  day orders  a day order is an order to trade that expires if it is not executed the day that it is booked to the marketplace any unfilled portion of a day order will expire at the close of business of the marketplace where the order was last entered  good through orders good through orders are orders that will remain open for a maximum of  days these orders will be entered on the default marketplace if they are not immediately executable at the time of entry the order will remain booked until executed cancelled or upon expiry whichever comes first  market orders  a market order is an order to buy or sell a security at whatever prices are available in the marketplace market orders will be handled in the priority they are received with a market order there is no control over what the best price available will be at the moment the trade is executed in cases of extreme market volatility or liquidity imbalance a market order may trade at a price which is significantly different than the expected execution price investors are recommended to use aggressively priced limit orders in place of market orders to eliminate the risk of the order trading at a price outside of an acceptable range any unfilled portion of a market order will expire at the close of business of the marketplace where the order was last entered  limit orders  a limit order is an order for a security at a specific minimum sale price or maximum purchase price that is not to be exceeded limit orders will be handled in the priority they are received a limit order provides control over the execution price but also reduces the certainty of execution it is possible a limit order will miss the opportunity to buy or to sell a stock in a fast moving market aggressively priced limit orders when a buy limit order has a higher price than the prevailing offer price and a sell limit order has a lower price than the prevailing bid price will trade much like a market order increasing the certainty of execution without the risk of the order trading at a price outside of an acceptable range any unfilled portion of a limit order will expire at the close of business of the marketplace where the order was last entered special terms orders  special terms orders are orders with specific terms that are not executable in the regular marketplace special terms orders will only post to the special terms market of the primary listing exchange unless they are immediately executable on an alternative marketplace at the time of entry any unfilled portion of a special terms order will expire at the close of the primary listing exchange  stop loss orders canadian markets  stop loss orders are orders that become market orders or limit orders when a board lot trades at or through the stop price on the marketplace in which the order has been booked stop loss orders are booked to the primary listing exchange a stop loss market order is filled at the best available market price once the on stop price is activated however if the order enters the market when the stock or overall market is experiencing dramatic fluctuations including rapid declines an investor may receive a price that is much different than expected caldwell securities does not accept stop loss limits all stop loss orders are reviewed by the head trader to ensure the volume of the order is not at a level that would result in market volatility should the on stop price be activated  crosses  internal or intentional crosses are recorded on the market at the midway price between the bid and ask at the time the orders are received  disclosure of marketplace  trade confirmations state that an order has been executed on one or more marketplaces or alternative marketplaces client may contact their investment advisor for further details regarding which marketplace or alternative marketplace a trade was executed on  the information contained herein is current as of december   trade matching statement skip to content

options and erisa complaints erisa employee retirement income security act regulates employee benefit and pension plans both of which can be tied into stock options employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company andor its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk issues involved in erisa include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options denying an employee rights granted by a stock option agreement misrepresenting the value of the stock failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given furthermore it is a violation of erisa for an employer to take deductions from an employees paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan under erisa it is illegal for an employer to discharge fine suspend expel discipline or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan… claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan in such situations the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken companies that have had erisa complaints filed against them
