the broadview small cap trump bumpreset button for mgichilltop holdings inc hth  chemical financial corp chfc km group holdings inc ktwohealthcare reform  brief opiniondisclaimers small cap trump bump – rick lane cfa small cap stocks enjoyed strong gains in  and dramatically outperformed their large cap brethren the first quarter of  witnessed precisely the opposite  similarly value and core strategies strongly outperformed growth in  and reversed course in the first quarter broadeview’s small cap composite performed in line with the above trends mean reversion is very much in play here and is not at all surprising “trump bump” beneficiaries such as financials and industrials are in the process of trimming the significant postelection gains we elected to monetize some of our winners in those two groups deemed to be ahead of fundamentals and that hit our price targets having said that we do feel the fundamentals in these two industries are positive   we believe we will have nice opportunities to reinvest subsequent to the ongoing correction as we write this the three legs to the trump economic policy health reform tax reform and infrastructure build are unsurprisingly bogged down in congress the sausagemaking political process is never pretty to watch and always takes longer than originally hoped we will monitor these important issues closely without them we may not get the extended cycle we initially theorized immediately following the election we have a long list of investment candidates for the portfolio pending lower prices andor successful economic legislation stay tuned—this may get very interesting reset button for mgic – rick lane cfa mgic investment corporation mtg is our largest holding the milwaukeebased company provides mortgage insurance to lenders against default loss from lowdownpayment borrowers typically under  mortgage originations particularly from first time homebuyers drive the company’s revenue and is thus very much tied to the strength of the economy credit losses are mgic’s main expense and are typically hypersensitive to the state of the business cycle the housing market has enjoyed a reasonably robust run over the past few years while credit losses have been extremely low a point to which we will return shortly given that backdrop mgic’s strong stock price performance over the past several years should hardly be a surprise however many investors ourselves included feared that political meddling could derail mgic’s favorable operating environment the election in november might have resulted in tighter financial regulation higher taxes and a general disposition to favor government programs over private market solutions indeed in a postelection “hail mary” the outgoing head of the department of housing and urban development or hud lowered the insurance premium on federal housing administration fha insured lowdownpayment home loans—its tenuous financial condition notwithstanding the fha is the governmentbacked insurer of lowdownpayment mortgage loans hence the principal competitor to mgic and its private enterprise cohorts donald trump’s surprise win changed everything his campaign promised regulatory reformrollback tax reform and an overall probusiness stance the “trump era” likely extends the current economic cycle and should be positive for most industries and businesses with respect to mgic very few industries are more levered to this dramatic change in events than the mortgage insurance industry in his first official act newly appointed hud secretary dr ben carson rescinded the fha premium reduction setting the stage for private mortgage insurers pmis to claw back some market share having given the foot view of the pmi investment case the balance of the mgic discussion delves into the investment case details the notion of an extended economic cycle is key to the mgic investment case  this yields more time for the strong underlying fundamentals to play out based on this there are three key drivers to our investment thesis the first is the new administration’s commitment to private market solutions  since the start of this cycle  timeframe the fha has grown its book of insurance from roughly  billion to some  trillion for perspective the pmi industry collectively insures about  billion the fha was originally set up to insure low fico low down payment loans to homebuyers unable to qualify for conventional home financing prospective first time homebuyers qualifying for conventional financing were expected to avail themselves of private mortgage insurance in fact encouraged by various government entities the fha encroached on pmi turf and wrestled away market share some  of the fha’s book is now higher fico score loans than could have been insured through the pmi industry  this fha strategy has historically resulted in underpricing and severe losses the trump administration all but eliminates the fha price reduction possibility  this is likely to further curb the fha’s growth to the direct benefit of pmis another aspect to the private market focus of the new administration is the potential for government sponsored enterprise gse reform  recall that fannie mae fnma and freddie mac fmcc purchase the majority of new mortgages from mortgage originators banks and mortgage brokers in turn the gses securitize the newly created mortgages essentially guaranteeing and pooling them into mortgagebacked securities sold to investors fannie mae and freddie mac dictate “conventional” lending standards generally speaking they require homebuyers to put at least  down or purchase mortgage insurance to cover the shortfall unique to the pmi industry the lender is the beneficiary of the insurance even though the borrower pays the premium in the event of a default the pmis are the first loss position while the gse absorb any additional losses beyond the pmi coverage historically investors and the pmis themselves were justly paranoid that the gses would elbow out the pmis by insuring  of the mortgage this issue has ebbed and flowed over the years a political tugofwar given the magnitude of the  mortgage debacle the momentum has swung back in favor of the pmis taking a larger role the trump administration would likely further that momentum but given the volatile history of the gses we are not holding our breath several housing finance reform templates have been put forward including the royce bill and johnsoncrapo bill our thinking is that eventually fannie mae and freddie mac will be recognized as an essential part of the mortgage origination industry and left in place with one important difference the risk to tax payers will be reduced by private players who essentially take a greater piece of the risk the increased risk sharing could take place up front by pmis assuming a greater percent of the loan risk known as deeper coverage or on the back end through the securitization processcapital markets while the gse reform opportunity represents significant upside to our base case the odds are tough to call even without gse reform the absence of negative political risk is still significant historically the risk to pmis from government fiat put a ceiling on valuation no matter how strong the underlying business trends we believe this risk is off the table for the next four years and should allow valuations to move up commensurate with the strong underlying fundamentals the second key driver to our investment case is our contention that the “old book” of business—mortgages guaranteed during the disastrous bubble years of  through — is over reserved this “old book” has been in runoff mode for quite a while claims have stabilized and are starting to decline over the next several years we believe mgic could release up to several hundred million dollars in “excess reserves” in addition to reserves already released our analysis suggests the market is giving mgic littletono credit on this front many investors will not even consider mgic because of the perceived risk that the “old book” is in fact under reserved the old book aspect sufficiently muddies and complicates the investment case such that many investors just move on the third and final driver is the stunningly pristine and profitable “new book” of business – mortgages guaranteed after  this new book is so conservatively underwritten that losses have been de minimis as the old book burns off over the next few years the new book “butterfly” should emerge and investors will have a much clearer understanding of just how outstanding the new book really is as a check on mgic’s combined new book and old book reserves we reverse engineered competitor essent group ltd’s esnt reserves essent went public after the  mortgage bust so it only has a “new book” of business its credit metrics are very similar to mgic’s new book we took essent’s reserve metrics and applied those to mgic’s new book adjusted for mgic’s larger book we then assigned the balance of mgic’s total reserves to mgic’s old book of business the result left a sufficiently large balance of reserves which further assuaged our worry about insufficient reserves bolstering our belief that substantial redundant reserves likely exist as an aside essent carries a large valuation premium to mgic which makes little sense again investors have gravitated to the simplicity of the essent story uncomplicated by the old book we believe the opposite is true mgic’s old book carries value in the form of excess reserves eventually mgic and essent will approach each other in an asymptote fashion as mgic’s old book of business runs off with the excess old book reserves in summary we believe mgic is poised to deliver strong earnings growth for the next several years the company’s excess capital approximately  million vis a vis pmiers gse capital requirements and  billion at the state of wisconsin level only enhances the argument for higher valuation further our research suggests that the tail risk long associated with the pmi industry will be mitigated by old book excess reserves and overly conservative underwriting of the new book with earnings power in the  to  range assuming excess capital is deployed to shrink the outstanding shares and return on equity is in the  range longer term we target a  price objective  months out upside could develop if investors embrace our higher valuation argument hilltop holdings inc hth  chemical financial corp chfc – sam koehler in the first quarter we took an opportunity to swap part of our hilltop holdings position for stock in chemical financial  hilltop is a financial company in which we still have a long term positive outlook so the position reduction is a reflection of the relative attractiveness in chemical financial  hilltop’s stock appreciated materially since an early low caused by fears of energy credit losses  we were confident in the loan quality at hilltop due to a long history of conservative credit culture and a low concentration in energy loans   as energy fears subsided the stock strongly rebounded  nearterm acquisition opportunities may be harder to come by given a core competency is buying and fixing discounted banks  this extended bull market has not caused many bank credit issues or failures and therefore has reduced the potential pool of acquisitions for hilltop  this is a name we still like over the long term and think highly of the future prospects however we believed that there was a strong relative opportunity in chemical financial chemical financial is the largest michigan headquartered bank with a footprint extending into indiana and ohio  with a history as a strong communityoriented bank the company was transformed by an early merger with talmer bancorp  we followed talmer closely since the initial public offering in early  we were impressed with the strong management team success in buying troubled banks and the prospects for future growth  talmer was led by an exceptionally strong management team including ceo david provost who has subsequently joined the chemical board of directors and cfo dennis klaeser who serves in the same role at the combined organization   the combined chemical management team is impressive as well with ceo david ramaker leading the company since  the merger between chemical and talmer created strong revenue growth and cost synergy opportunities and the organization is on track to meet targets in our opinion  chemical has been able to generate loan growth faster than the industry while maintaining expense discipline and strong credit quality which has resulted in above peer returns  as the integration matures and chemical completes its first stress test later in the year triggered by crossing the  billion asset threshold with the merger  we believe the company will be well positioned to again consider more acquisitions to strengthen the franchise  despite these attractive traits chemical trades at a discounted valuation compared to the regional bank index and moreover has a nice dividend yield km group holdings inc ktwo – aaron garcia cfa another recent addition to our portfolio is km an orthopedic implant manufacturer specializing in complex spine technologies we became aware of this company’s product portfolio through our due diligence on ldr spine usa inc another orthopedic company we owned which was purchased by zimmer biomet holdings inc zbh in  km has a differentiated product portfolio with a leading position in spinal deformity this is a niche area of spinal implants which has limited innovation or competition from larger players the company is also one of the leading innovators in d printed implants which allow for easier manufacturing of structures that can promote bone growth and fusion we believe the lack of innovation by larger competitors provides km outsized revenue growth potential via market share gains and a large group of potential acquirers should the company seek a sale we believe management is capable of continuing to grow the top line faster than the industry and the new product pipeline is robust   was a bit of a challenging year for the company due to international distributor issues and some delays in product registration which caused revenue disappointment in addition private equity sponsors exited the stock resulting in a surfeit of shares in a tough healthcare backdrop we think the company’s financial performance is poised to bounce back in  and the longterm growth opportunity is promising we initiated the position in mid and have opportunistically added to the position in the first quarter of  healthcare reform  brief opinion – aaron garcia cfa we believe there is still a chance that the house republicans will revive the acha however there remains a philosophical schism in the republican party as to the government’s role in healthcare we feel that any of the more austere solutions favored by the freedom caucus will face a tough road in the senate healthcare reform remains an incredibly difficult process from an investment standpoint we have avoided investing in hospitals managed care life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors we think these areas offer the most reform risk and could be more volatile due to movement in washington we have focused our attention on low volatility distribution and supplier businesses as well as small growth companies with significant product cycle opportunities we think the likelihood of volatility from legislative headlines will provide further opportunities to buy strong franchises at cheap valuations disclaimers – broadview advisors llc broadview advisors llc is an secregistered investment
