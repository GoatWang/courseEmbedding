officer hattar held that position for ixia which was recently acquired by keysight keysight technologies introduces nano indenter g jun   keysight technologies inc announced the availability of a highaccuracy tip and sample heater to expand the utility of its popular nano indenter g this easytouse solution uses a precise highpower diode laser to heat the sample and the indenter tip benefits include the ability to measure nanomechanical properties at precisely controlled temperatures and to test a wide range of samples under highly dynamic temperature conditions to ensure reliable data the system minimizes drift associated with heating by using functionoptimized materials and an adjustable laser spot size keysight nano indenter g users also have the option to purge samples with various gases to avoid contamination and oxidation the new tip and sample heater for the g supports a wide temperature range rt up to  c and is accurate to within  c another advantage is the high rate of the systems heating and cooling processes depending on the temperature the rate can exceed  ksec in either direction this capability affords scientists and engineers many new and intriguing opportunities for dynamic materials testing keysights laserheated indenter tip a critical component of the new system solution prevents disturbance of the substrate temperature during measurement this stability is critical for working with materials that have poor thermal conductivity and whose mechanical properties are strongly affected by temperature keeping the tip and sample at the same temperature as one another also allows g users to perform hightemperature continuous stiffness measurements with exceptional precision the nano indenter g systems substrate holder is optimized to provide the highest mechanical and temperature stability to ensure simple and convenient g operation the transparent plate underneath the sample contains a builtin thermocouple when the absolute highest accuracy is needed such as for nanoindentation applications involving thick polymer samples users can mount a thermocouple to the sample surface the dualloop pid controllers nanosuite

surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a

reported its second quarter and gives updates in the ixia acquisitionrevenues guidance for the next quarter are expected to rise in the range of  to the market has reacted negatively due to an increase in long term debt and a higher addition of outstanding shares than expectedmarket value remains below its peers even after a change in valuations keysight technologies inc nysekeys reported  million in revenue coming from the second quarter meaning a  growth from last year and a  rise from the prior quarter this result includes only  days of revenue from ixia an acquisition which was closed in april and was driven mainly by an increase in the electronic industrial solutions revenues have remained almost flat since they started trading as an independent company from agilent technologies inc nyse a due to a combination of product segments that are delivering growth and others that are lagging to understand which segment is boosting growth and which one is offsetting it keysight presents its results by market segment the first one is the communication solution group which is supporting sales heavily but also with ups and downs due to the nature of the markets where it serves this group can be broken down into the commercial communications market and the aerospace defense and government market source information extracted from keysight technologies filings for the commercial communications market revenue from the q was  million basically the same of what can be observed from previous quarters these sales are sustained by the g and nextgeneration data center technology manufacturers to whom keysight provide test and electronic measurement instruments sales coming from g are countered by a declining spending in wireless g although this trend could be reversed in the next quarter as they recently got selected by qualcomm nasdaqqcom to test g chipsets and provide test solutions for protocol and rf validation on the other hand aerospace defense and government market have experienced some weakness in previous quarters coming from russia and china with lower levels of orders and spending although it seems to be upholding additionally revenue have been impacted in this marked by soft spending in the us due to delayed budget approvals and as noted by the executives is difficult to predict when the flow of funding will return to a steady state this kind of market is characterized by these setbacks and is subject to government expending which gives an additional risk and uncertainty on future earnings and orders although in some quarters have deliver abnormal earnings like in fq on  and boost revenue growth most of the time lacks of consistency and diminish it moving to the electronic industry solutions group for the period ended april  revenue saw a record high topping for  million a  increase from the last year which improved mostly by the semiconductor measurement solutions and the automotive and energy solutions moreover an interesting incorporation of new key customers for automotive solutions was noted for the period as more suppliers in the industry are shifting to autonomousdriving which are developing wireless communications radar and smart battery being these are areas of strength for keysight new orders coming from this key customer could continue lifting this segment for the next quarters now about the acquisition of ixia that closed in april  a new operating segment arrays from it named the ixia solutions group broadening keysight services in the highspeed data centers by offering network security test and solutions the incorporated revenues since the acquisition closed was  million and orders of  million for the full quarter which are expected to be recognized as revenue over time ixia outstanding common stock cost about  billion or  per share and was funded through a combination of cash and proceeds from debt and equity financing giving an increased long term debt of  billion from the prior quarter with all this in mind keysight faces several challenges in some market segments which are slowing down revenue growth or have not grown at all some of them like commercial communications semiconductor measurement and automotive are showing an increase in sales and some momentum with future prospect in the long term the socalled transformation for growth mentioned by the ceo ronald s nersesian come at the hand of ixia acquisition which will allow to be better positioned and it could take advantage on highspeed datacenters and the g technology transition growth drivers by competitor expanding the landscape there are other key players in the electronic measurement equipment industry which are listed by keysight and arrange by market segments their major competitors are fortive corp nyseftv and its subsidiaries national instruments corp nasdaqnati teledyne technologies inc nysetdy and teradyne inc nyseter which are listed in the us source data compiled from several different sources from the sec of these competitors the most capitalized is fortive which has enjoyed some momentum in sales since it started trading in june from last year in the first quarter of  revenue increase  to  billion supported by growth on all its platforms and as well by acquisitions the catalysts that boosted this surge in sales comes from its subsidiaries tektronix and gilbarco veederroot which are delivering double digit growth and as a result gaining market share in the regions of north america and western europe the guidance has been risen given that are feeling confident in its investments and acquisitions expecting an eps for the full year of  in a range of  to  which includes an assumption of low to midsingle digit core revenue growth coming with a similar growth in the same period is national instruments and like keysight this growth has been inconsistent over periods the revenue in the first quarter of  was about  million a  improvement from the same period last year mainly supported by its wireless semiconductor and transportation test systems looking backwards the reasons for this disparity in results quarter over quarter is attributed mainly by fluctuations in revenues from its largest customer and the impact of foreign currency exchange the issues national instruments faces are pretty specific and come from expense overruns and manufacturing inefficiencies which in additions to volatility coming from larger orders and clients has left the company in a state of stagnation in previous quarters despite this the expectation for the q are in the range of  million to  million in revenue meaning a  increase in the midpoint which could imply a new run for sales growth coming from its rf products and semiconductor test systems another story is teledyne which has reported an increase in revenues year over year for the first time in a while achieved by growth coming from each of its business segments teledyne has gone through a significant decline in its marine instrumentation for the past  years guided by the energy sector decline in capex and investment in the sensors that are used for exploration and production this has deteriorated overall sales and offset growth coming from other sectors like digital imaging and the aerospace and defense electronics revenues for teledyne in the first quarter of  were  million a  increase yoy and  from the previous quarter this result was due to strong performance in its digital imaging that grow  from the last year delivering  million alone complementary teledyne portfolio in this segment is the acquisition of ev technologies plc that got completed by march  on the present year a company that provides high performance image sensors custom camera solutions and application specific standard products in addition to the existing products line this acquisition has not yet been reflected and is expected to lift full year eps in the range of  to  moving on to teradyne inc revenue has seen major ups and downs giving the fact that sales of its products and services are subject to cyclical trends and demand from its customers who often delays or advance purchases in relation to their business cycles teradyne note on its filings that this seasonality impact mainly the semiconductor test segment and this tendency could be seen as an evenodd year trend where demand increased in even years and decreased in odd years considering all this teradyne reported growth in revenues by a  yoy or  million compare to  from a year ago the drivers for this increase was the semi test and universal robots markets demand that continue its strong pace from the previous quarter particularly the first one with a contribution on revenues of  or  million turning for the next quarters executives are expecting sales coming into the range of  million and  million meaning about a  increase from the fq in the midpoint as a result of customers that are speeding up orders to get capacity in place sooner than in other years in the end it seems that the industry of electronic measurement equipment in general is highly competitive and is having a switch through communication markets and new technologies like g mobile iot d sensing autonomous car and consumer electronics revenue coming from these sources could mean a renovation in terms of growth for those companies investing in it and restructuring to serve these markets however this value added will take some time to be capitalized market valuation for keysight recent results have been discounted negatively probably by an increase in long term debt and also by an addition above than was expected of outstanding shares for the period causing a dilutive effect this has led to a change in valuation as ratios has risen even though holding lower levels compare to its peers also it seems to be trading at a premium over its year average as a result of current stability of some of its market segments especially the aerospace and defense source compiled and calculated using information from the sec and market prices from google in addition there has been an increase in activity coming from analyst in one side citigroup initiated coverage on keysight with a target price of  and a recommendation of buy on may  contrarily goldman sachs reinstated its position of neutral with a target price of  right before the second quarter results in the outlook executives announced guidance on revenues coming from the next quarter in the range of  million to  million a  yoy increase in the midpoint and  from this quarter they are feeling confident on their recent acquisition and new partnership with qualcomm although it seems that something else is needed to lift the price from what it seems to be a
