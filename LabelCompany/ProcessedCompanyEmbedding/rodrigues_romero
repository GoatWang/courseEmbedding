business colombian newspaper and another from a chilean business magazine both of them wrote articles about one business which i was working before i came to the us and which i would like to explain to you in more detail resume i have over that fourteen years of experience in financial markets and right now i would like to launch a hedge fund specialized in latinamerican markets here you will find my resume colombian soccer teams ipo’s the business idea is to try to do ipo’s with the most important colombian soccer teams in colombia the soccer teams were created as a nonprofit organization during some time this business model worked however nowadays the majority of the soccer teams are living deep financial problems therefore the idea is to resolve that problem using two ways first we will transform the teams into forprofit organizations second we will raise money to financing the new business model which will be more related with the english premier league management ideas which means to see the teams as an entertainment companies one of our principal aims as an investment banking company is trying to increase the number of company which want to issue their stocks in the public market we strongly believe that this is one of the most important ways to help the entrepreneurs and colombian economy in general for that reason we claim that with this project we might convince other companies to use the stock market as a place to find funding articles this is an article from a chilean magazine which wrote their perspective about this business opportunity httparchivolaprensacomniarchivodiciembrenoticiaseconomia in this article you will find a brief explanation about what the project is and what we think it might help the soccer industry in colombia
