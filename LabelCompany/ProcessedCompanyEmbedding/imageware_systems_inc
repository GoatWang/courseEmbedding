database searching methodspatent number  issued  filed  read patentabstract the present invention provides techniques for efficient searching of a multimodal biometric database nested searching improves search efficiency by using the results of a previous biometric modality search to limit the search population for subsequent biometric searches the method can also be used in combinations of nonbiometric searches limiting subsequent biometric searches or vice versa systems and methods for biometric data management using relational database management systems rdbmspatent number  issued  filed  read patentabstract a structured query language sql relational database management system sq rdbms may integrate a biometric subsystem to process and manage biometric data separately from the demographic data stored in normalized sql tables of the sql rdbms the sql rdbms may be operatively connected to the biometric subsystem by means of sql extensions the sql rdbms may execute queries with demographic andor biometric constraints wherein the demographic data is retrieved directly from normalized sql tables on the rdbms while the biometric data is retrieved in the form of scores or probabilities from the biometric subsystem the sql rdbms may return a query result set containing demographic data associated with corresponding biometric data allowing the authentication of biometric clients anonymous biometric identificationpatent number  issued  filed  read patentabstract this disclosure describes methods for identifying an individual in an anonymous biometric authentication system where an individual’s biometric data is captured by a device and the resulting probe is compared with the templates in a previously enrolled population the system comprises a biographic identity management system having a nonanonymous sector in communication with an anonymous sector through a network cloud the anonymous sector or anonymous biometric identity management system contains an index of tokens associated each associated uniquely with a biometric template which may then be compared with a biometric probe to determine the identity of an individual anonymous biometric enrollmentpatent number  issued  filed  read patentabstract in the present invention systems and methods to perform the biometric anonymous enrollment of an individual into an anonymous biometric engine are disclosed an enrollment authority or client verifies the credentials of an individual and collects the biographicdemographic and biometric information the biographic demographic information is stored by the enrollment authority and a token is generated for the individual the biometric information and the token are sent to a biometric engine for storage the stored information may be used to identify or verify individuals anonymous biometric verificationpatent number  issued  filed  read patentabstract the present invention discloses an anonymous biometric verification system and method in an embodiment of the invention the system comprises a nonanonymous sector that retrieves biometric data probes by using biometric clients a unique identifier “token” is retrieved from a database that contains biographic and demographic data associated to the token but without comprising the biographic or demographic data the biometric data in form of templates along with the token are then sent via a cloud network to an anonymous sector a query router located at the nonanonymous sector may receive probes with the token and send them to one or more biometric query engines wherein query engines may either work in stripped or mirrored operation mode query engines may search for location of templates in a templates database linked to a query search engine multimodal biometric analysispatent number  issued  filed  read patentabstract a biometric system that uses readings from a plurality of biometrics of a user is disclosed the biometric system includes a first and second biometric readers a first and second biometric matching engines and a processor the first biometric reader producing a first measured biometric that is processed by the first biometric matching engine to deliver a first value which is indicative of a likelihood that the first measured biometric matches a first stored biometric reading a plurality of first values are gathered prior to the first value the second biometric reader delivers a second measured biometric for processing by the second biometric matching engine to produce a second value which is indicative of a likelihood that the second measured biometric matches a second stored biometric reading a plurality of second values are gathered prior to the second value the first and second biometric readers measure a different biometric or the first and second biometric matching engines use a different algorithm the processor normalizes the first value according to the plurality of first values normalizes the second value according to the plurality of second values and determines if the user matches a person using the normalized first and second values related international patents a china       australia

which is capable of receiving pushed messages typically the message includes a question along with answers for the recipient to choose from each answer corresponds with a preassigned response key and the recipient answers the question by selecting one of the preassigned response keys the recipient’s response is available to the sender in the form of an email wap push online access or interactive
