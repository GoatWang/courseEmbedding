daniel vasella – european ceo ›digital editions   daniel vasellawhile vasella has overseen the production of some extremely effective products his company has also experienced some of the biggest scandals in the past five years   profiles  jul  it is not easy to discern what made dr daniel vasella abandon his career as a doctor in favour of the pharmaceutical industry some have suggested that he was driven by personal experience of serious ill health during his childhood others that it was frustration at the slow pace of career progression in medicine and still others that he preferred the business and development side of medicine to a patient facing role whatever his reasons since leaving medicine in  vasella has risen from the humble post of a travelling salesman for sandoz pharmaceuticals corporation in new jersey to the ceo and chairman of one of the world’s most important pharmaceutical companies – novartis novartis was formed in  through a merger between swiss drug companies sandoz and cibageigy overseen by vasella in his role as ceo of sandoz it appears that the name ‘novartis’ was developed by vasella himself bringing together the latin words “novae” and “artis” meaning “new skills” a very apt title as the way that the company works is very different to others in its field in  vasella took the decision to base the business’ rd firmly in science while the idea of science being the bedrock of drug development may seem obvious what this meant in reality was that vasella would not push through new products to the testing stage unless there was a solid body of evidence that trials would be likely to succeed an example of this is when as recounted by business week he declined to advance an experimental alzheimer’s drug to testing as too little is known about the disease itself this policy stems from an acknowledgement that the end beneficiary of the product and the end purchaser is the patient not the company’s shareholders – surely a stance influenced by vasella’s time spent practicing medicine it is a decision that has meant that the success of novartis’ drug trails and thus the number of products reaching the market is much higher than that of its competitors at  percent but the company has not been without its troubles the first major scandal took place in  in india in  india changed its patent laws bringing them inline with international law novartis was one of the first companies to file a suit under the new law as one of its most successful drugs glivec used in the treatment of cancer was being produced in generic form without license to be sold cheaply to the indian people during the trial campaign organisations such as oxfam and medecins sans frontieres declared that if novartis won then life saving medicines would be put out of reach of the hundreds of thousands of poor living in the country and the wider developing world as a result of the campaign demonstrations took place in india and over half a million people worldwide wrote to vasella personally to voice their protest at the company’s actions oxfam declared a moral victory when after the indian courts denied novartis’ motion the business chose not to appeal in june  the company suffered additional criticism refusing to donate flu vaccines free to people in the developing world during the flu pandemic as competitor glaxosmithkline had most recently a major sexual discrimination case a class action brought by  current or former female employees has caused the firm serious embarrassment in america this was no ordinary sexual discrimination case while some familiar allegations remain such as pregnant staff members being excluded overlooked for promotion or pay rises features such a women being coached in how to seduce clients and having their ears licked when on sales visits have made this case all the more unusual the allegations that have caused the company most damage are those made by marjorie salame who told the court that she was sexually assaulted by a long time client when she reported the incident to her manager she was threatened with disciplinary action and told to accept responsibility for what had happened judgement was reached on may  when the court awarded the claimants m in punitive damages –two percent of the company’s estimated m value this was in addition to the m already awarded to another  women two days previously when possible compensatory damages are also considered the total bill for novartis could top bn but not all problems have been instigated by novartis in  vasella was personally targeted by militant animals rights activists the problems began in mid july with threats such as “death to vasella” and “we are watching you” painted on the road outside his house in the village of risch in switzerland as well as on the village church two weeks later his parents’ graves were desecrated and his mothers’ ashes stolen novartis employees across europe were also targeted with bombs being attached to cars and the company leisure centre in france being burnt down finally on august  vasella’s holiday home in austria was set alight prompting him to sell the property so as to avoid any future danger to the residents in the area no group ever claimed responsibility for the acts although novartis pointed the finger at shac because of the message “drop hls huntingdon life sciences now” it was a particularly difficult issue for the company to address as it claimed to have dropped huntingdon life sciences years ago after an impressive career at novartis daniel vasella stepped aside as ceo of the company on february   while remaining chairman there have been controversies and problems under his watch but there have also been great successes – not least of which is the creation of novartis itself many believe this will increase the company’s competitiveness and innovation and with his background in consumer goods successor joe jimenez will be a break from tradition nevertheless it is vasella who made the company what it is today and whose enduser based business philosophy led it to be the second largest pharmaceuticals company in europe by sales

pharmaceutical achievement awards  sidelights in eight years daniel vasella went from being a doctor to becoming the head of novartis one of the worlds biggest drug companies he has managed the company with a doctors interest in research into new treatments and a toughminded businessmans aggressive innovative thinking thanks to his leadership novartis has released a daniel vasella drug that fights a rare cancer without hurting healthy cells and his company has dozens of new drugs almost ready for market at a time when competitors are running low on new products in early  he led novartis in a bold move into the generic drug market again showing his competitive streak and calculated risktaking vasella who was born in switzerland in  had to face illness and death at a young age he came down with tuberculosis and meningitis as a child when he was ten his older sister died of cancer three years later his father oskar a history professor died of complications from surgery he says watching his sister fight her illness led to his interest in medicine and he went to the university of bern medical school another sister who went to medical school with him died in an accident in  after getting his medical degree vasella worked in pathology and internal medicine eventually becoming the university of berns chief resident but he was developing an interest in business so he left the hospital to join the drug company sandoz pharma where his wifes uncle was chief executive officer he started working at the sandoz office in new jersey where he became product manager for an antipancreatic cancer drug he knew that his success depended on the drugs success so he had researchers production chemists and marketers work together to find new uses for the drug instead of the usual practice of the three groups working in isolation they discovered that it could also treat the side effects of certain cancers and its sales skyrocketed returning to switzerland in  vasella worked in top corporate positions using the methods he had developed with the cancer drug on all of sandozs drugdevelopment efforts he became ceo of sandoz in  and when sandoz merged with rival cibageigy to form novartis in  vasella was named the new companys ceo his family ties to sandoz made some feel he had gotten the job out of nepotism but others disagree to anyone who followed the company at the time dan was the live wire sg cowen analyst peter laing told unmesh kher of time he had the most international outlook and there really wasnt anyone at ciba to challenge him making the new company work was difficult sandoz had a hierarchical leadership style that vasella thought discouraged initiative while the culture at ciba seemed to discourage strong decisionmaking both companies had started off as chemical companies and gone into drug manufacturing now they were pharmaceutical companies that still had some chemical production business left over vasella reorganized the company laying off  workers and firing several managers and formed a venture fund that helped exemployees start new businesses for a while when vasella would travel to novartis offices around the world he would fire managers immediately if he did not like what they did or said until he was told that workers had started to fear his visits now i ask that they not be fired until several weeks after i come back to switzerland he told the wall street journal at first success was slow to come novartis sales increased only slightly in  and  vasella invested in life sciences with the idea that new biotechnology would link the drug business with agricultural and nutritional products but the life sciences market floundered vasella realized it and abandoned his goal novartis sold off its agricultural arm in  at the time novartis competitors in the pharmaceutical industry dismissed it as a sleepy european giant without the marketing and sales firepower to compete in the us wrote kerry capell of businessweek but thanks to vasellas decision to spend heavily on research and marketing novartis scored a huge success when it released the cancer drug gleevec in may of  gleevec worked on relatively rare forms of cancer such as chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors but the way it works is unique and promising it is the first drug that had been proven to destroy a certain kind of tumor other cancer drugs destroy healthy cells and cancer cells alike but gleevec attacks the proteins that make tumors grow vasellas leadership was a key ingredient in gleevecs success according to the magazine chief executive after the sandozcibageigy merger vasella talked to some cibageigy researchers who told him about the drug compound that eventually became gleevec although it seemed the drug would only appeal to a narrow market because it treated a rare disease vasella pushed for testing and production of it to move forward and personally answered the letters from cancer patients who asked to be included in the trials in  vasella told the story in a book magic cancer bullet how a tiny orange pill is rewriting medical history cowritten with robert slater clifton leaf a writer for fortune called the book a heroic saga attracted to the story of a corporate culture championing a lifesaving drug publishers weekly acknowledged it was an inspiring story but complained that the book reads largely as an extended press release for novartis because of its repetition and stilted writing and lack of the details and depth of feeling needed to make that story come alive as ceo vasella is known for putting a lot of money into research and development in  novartis was spending  billion on research or  percent of its drug sales compared to an industry standard of  to  percent he moved the companys research and development headquarters from basel switzerland to cambridge massachusetts to take advantage of the boston areas heavy concentration of medical researchers and personally recruited a top scientist from harvard medical school to run the lab as a doctor vasella can oversee research better than other drug company ceos his admirers say because he can ask his research teams complex questions relying so much on research and development as opposed to say acquiring other companies and their patents is risky for a pharmaceutical company because it means betting on rare successes to come out of its labs but so far vasellas approach is paying off novartis moves its drugs through research and development in twothirds the time of the average drug company in part thanks to a strategy of testing a drug on several diseases at once it had  drugs in the medium or late stages of development in  compared to  and  at competitors roche and merck respectively vasellas accomplishments are more striking in comparison to his competitors who have struggled with decreased profits and competition from generic drugs novartis has had to face many of the same issues bedeviling its peers including expiring patents on bigselling drugs according to the wall street journal but dr vasella has steered the company through these problems in large part by jettisoning its staid swiss culture and transforming the firm into a bareknuckled americanstyle marketing powerhouse—a reference to his strategy for getting company researchers and marketers to work together to create more effective marketing strategies for products for instance the company dropped an ineffective ad for lamisil novartis treatment for fungal infections and created a brochure salesmen could give to doctors about the condition sales of lamisil went up afterward i love switzerland and i think people know that im patriotic vasella told harris but this is about making decisions that are essential to the business we are going to be as or even more american as any company vasellas success has won him a lot of praise in  time named vasella one of the worlds  most influential people the only drug company executive on the list readers of the financial times selected him as the most influential business leader in europe in the last  years capell of businessweek wrote that he is an unusual mix an aggressive manager who still keeps something of the gentle bedside manner he developed as a general practitioner vasella also has a casual calm persona capell described him as an unbuttoned type who likes roaring around the swiss countryside on his bmw bike to build on his achievements vasella moved to expand novartis he tripled its united states sales force to  seeing the united states—the worlds most lucrative drug market—as key to the companys future he also acquired some north american companies he bought a majority stake in idenix pharmaceuticals of cambridge massachusetts which was working on new drugs to treat hepatitis b and c for  million and bought sabex a canadian drug company for more than  million many business analysts expected vasella to make a big move to merge with another major company but he came back emptyhanded from his hunt for a big deal he looked longingly at roche also based in basel and began buying its stock but roches ceo and the family who owns the majority stake in the company were opposed to a merger as of early  novartis had only managed to acquire  percent of roche he also pursued a merger with french drug company aventis but he backed off after the french government preferring that the company remain french put up hurdles to a deal in january of  as novartis announced record profits and sales for  vasella got the drug industrys attention by speaking out about recent scandals involving other companies patented drugs he warned his competitors who had been accused of not releasing enough research information about side effects that they needed to become more open but he also told critics of the drug industry to back off from calls to ease patent protection that he said would discourage companies from researching new drugs hurting patients in the long run the next month novartis made a bold move it became the worlds biggest maker of generic drugs by spending  billion to buy hexal a german company that makes generic pharmaceuticals and eon labs hexals united states affiliate the generic drug market is expected to be lucrative in the next several years as patents on many popular drugs worth tens of billions of dollars expire novartis says it is pursuing a third route to success instead of focusing only on patented drugs or diversifying by going into other medical technologies the usual strategies of major pharmaceutical companies vasella whose salary was about  million in  believes novartis has a bright future the company predicted that by  or  it should have eight blockbuster drugs on the market—that is drugs with annual sales of  billion or more in early  it had five the possible future drugs include the first pill to fight multiple sclerosis a new asthma treatment and drugs to fight cancers and high blood pressure sources periodicals americas intelligence wire february   businessweek may   pp  chief executive july  p  financial times january

impact societyhuman needs sharebar vasella illustration by dennis balogh twenty years ago a young doctor with a hankering for business experience gave up his clinical practice in bern switzerland and moved to east hanover new jersey to try his hand at drug sales with the swiss conglomerate sandoz as highrisk career moves go this one played out brilliantly within a decade dr daniel vasella pmd   rocketed through the ranks of sandoz and in  led the firm’s merger with cibageigy emerging as ceo of the new company called novartis based in basel switzerland the merger put vasella’s leadership skills to the test as he methodically refashioned the two oldline chemical companies with disparate corporate cultures into a single entity focused on health care and powered by an innovative approach to rd today novartis is one of the world’s most dynamic and admired drug companies ranking no  with  sales of  billion the company’s aggressive investment in research has made it an industry leader in new drug approvals and when opportunity knocks vasella doesn’t hesitate to broaden novartis’s business mix through acquisitions he recently added generic drugs and vaccines to the company’s portfolio of product lines setting novartis apart from its global competitors although initially regarded by critics as too inexperienced to lead a multinational pharmaceutical company vasella has triumphed three years ago he was named “the most influential european businessman of the past  years” in a financial times poll of  executives he recently spoke about the public policy and business challenges ahead us consumers complain loudly that prescription drugs cost too much what’s your response we have a phenomenon where drug prices have been increasing above the rate of inflation so from that perspective complaints are understandable on the other side there are benefits mortality for many diseases has dropped dramatically over the last forty years analysis shows that  percent of that decline was due to drug therapy the big cost item in health care is not drugs which account for between  and  percent of the overall healthcare costs the big item is hospital costs even if you take away all profits from the pharmaceutical industry you could lower overall healthcare costs by maybe  percent at best so tweaking drug prices will not solve the fundamental problem the medicare prescription drug program that went into effect last year bars the federal government from negotiating with drug companies over the prices seniors pay the new democratic majority in congress has vowed to remove that barrier would seniors benefit this program is very much appreciated by seniors we have approval rates of way over  percent the costs of drugs in the program are lower than anticipated and consumers are purchasing drugs at very high discounts so i think the system seems to work pretty well the initial issues about confusing coverage and so forth have pretty much vanished in some ways the prescription drug program is one that should have been introduced by the democrats years ago because there was a real need for seniors to get drug coverage it wasn’t right that since  when medicare was enacted they didn’t have any drug coverage so the democrats are probably unhappy that the republicans passed the prescription drug law and some don’t like the fact that it relied on private insurance providers do drug companies have sufficient patent protection for new products there are two issues here one is the length of patent life twenty years in the united states and the other is the solidity of the patent regarding length it’s a sensitive point if we have delays in fda regulatory approval because more questions are being asked or if we are more diligent about studying a drug longer we pay by having a shorter patent life remaining once a drug goes to market there are people who say we should have a fixed number of years of patent protection after fda approval it would be quite difficult to change current law but there is a lot of rationale behind such an argument the second issue is solidity of the patent we have significant challenges of existing patents from the generics industry if you are not careful generic companies will be very creative about circumventing patents through litigation so patenting a product in a smart way has become much more complex that means patent lawyers have become as important to the defense side as to the attacking side novartis has  drugs in its pipeline more than any of its competitors how has the company become so successful at creating a culture of innovation initially we spent a lot of time integrating development with research and marketing functions that had been separate on a global basis we created project teams to move drugs forward that allowed us to have more approvals by the fda than any other major pharmaceutical company since the year  but those changes didn’t solve the problem of creating new compounds there we took an approach characterized by three things first we work closely with academic institutions and with biotech companies secondly we created a genomics institute at the scripps research institute in la jolla california and the most important step was to create in  the institutes for biomedical research in cambridge massachusetts we moved our research headquarters there from basel and developed a new integrated approach to genomics biology and chemistry novartis is the only drug company with leadership positions in both patented and generic drugs given the low margins why did you decide to get into the generics business profitable year speaking at a january   press conference in basel switzerland vasella announced that novartiss  net income rose  percent to  billion photo by georgios kefalasassociated press we have been active in generics for many years when the industry started to consolidate the question was do we get out of it or increase our stake in view of the longterm trends that we are seeing generics is a field that is here to stay and if we want to be in that field we need to be able to compete with the best the generics business is less profitable than the patented branded business but it’s growing at a faster pace whenever possible people switch from branded drugs to generics to cut their expenditures the question is are you in it for the margins or are you in it for growth of profits and top line our philosophy is to look for sustainable growth and to create and maintain a business that is competitive and that satisfies the needs of society and customers you also bought vaccine maker chiron even though vaccines have not been a popular business for years what makes vaccines an attractive business now first of all we owned  percent of chiron secondly we thought we would run it better the california biotech firm famously failed to produce enough flu vaccine for the us market in  and thirdly we saw that there was a significant growth opportunity due to new vaccines new diseases and new technologies we believe that in the next five years the growth rate of the vaccine industry will be between  and  percent making it a very attractive industry the margins are again not as high as in patented branded products but they still are quite attractive also one of the reasons why big pharma exited the vaccine business was that we had terrible litigation issues that abuse of litigation now has been limited with new legislation because the us government saw that nobody wanted to produce vaccines anymore do drug companies have a responsibility to supply lowcost drugs to poor countries even if it means losing money on the effort our most important responsibility is to discover develop and market better products that’s fundamentally our first responsibility if we are successful that success raises the question of what other roles and responsibilities we have in society aside from our primary mission and there i believe we have an opportunity as much as a responsibility to help people who don’t have the means for whatever reason to afford medicines that in many cases can be lifesaving last year we delivered to underdeveloped nations products and services valued at about  million which was over  percent of our sales and that exceeds the development aid as a percentage of gdp of many countries where the agreed target should be  percent of gdp most countries are way below that however we cannot fix poor governance corruption inadequate distribution systems or lack of healthcare professionals so the primary responsibility for health care is and remains with governments to take care of their citizens and in many cases unfortunately it appears that government leaders care more about their own pockets than about the wellbeing of their citizens we cannot punish patients because they have bad governments not surprisingly there is a tendency to shift responsibilities from governments to private industry but it would be unfair to push all responsibility to private industry one has to be careful about how much of this shifting is reasonable and when it starts to become unreasonable

and an early career as a physician influenced daniel vasella’s outlook as ceo of novartis which he built into one of the world’s largest drug companies daniel vasella’s early experiences with the health care industry were shaped by his own harrowing battles with childhood illness as a young boy in switzerland he was in and out of hospitals with a host of maladies including food poisoning and asthma at the age of eight he suffered attacks of tuberculosis and meningitis that forced him to spend a year in a sanatorium away from his family the compassion of doctors and nurses in that facility helped him through that difficult period and kindled his interest in medicine but the remainder of his youth was overshadowed by the death of his older sister from cancer when he was  and the death of his father in surgery when vasella was  sidebar daniel vasella biography vital statistics born august   in fribourg switzerland married with  children education graduated with an md in  from university of bern switzerland career highlights novartis serves as chairman –present served as ceo and executive member of board of directors – sandoz named ceo of sandoz  held position until sandoz merged with cibageigy to create novartis  joined us affiliate of sandoz as sales representative  fast facts member board of directors pepsico and american express member global health program advisory panel bill  melinda gates foundation member international board of governors peres center for peace in israel after graduating with high honors from university of bern where he studied medicine and psychoanalysis vasella practiced as a physician in switzerland until  when he accepted an offer from sandoz ag the swiss pharmaceutical giant to take a sales job with the company’s us affiliate vasella thrived in his new role the switch from medicine to business he says gave him the opportunity to do work that could benefit “not one or a hundred but thousands” of people he rose rapidly in sandoz’s marketing organization in  after a series of successful management assignments in the united states and switzerland he was named ceo a few years later vasella helped engineer what was then one of the largest mergers in corporate history by joining sandoz and its rival cibageigy to create novartis vasella was named ceo of the new company and retained that position until january  he was appointed chairman of novartis’s board of directors in  and continues to serve in that capacity as ceo vasella built novartis into one of the world’s largest drug companies by sales he shifted research away from making incremental advances in older medicines for common maladies to focusing instead on drugs for rare critical diseases whose biological origins could be understood and treated he pushed novartis to invest in new areas of health care such as generics and led efforts to expand the company’s presence in china he also spearheaded novartis’s  billion acquisition of us eyecare company alcon that purchase completed in  positioned novartis as a global leader in one of the health care industry’s fastestgrowing segments in this january  interview with mckinsey’s rik kirkland vasella discusses the importance of resilience in leading large organizations mckinsey do you have the sense that for leaders of large global organizations such as novartis the context has changed compared with say ten years ago if so what are some of the key differences daniel vasella the context has changed without a doubt—and i think it will continue to evolve if i think about our business there are many differences one is that people everywhere are living longer another is the ascendance of new economies—africa china latin america and then there is the rising indebtedness of governments paired with monetary expansion so you’ve got longer life spans expanding populations and more wealth in emerging economies all of those imply opportunities and risks aging and growing disposable income increase the demand for health care but at the same time they pose challenges as government debt and weak economies in industrialized countries are the source of pricing pressures for us which in turn forces us to push harder to raise productivity and can lead to restructuring and loss of employment all these things create tremendous tension you want to do the right thing but you have many different responsibilities mckinsey do you find you are spending more time dealing with officials in the public sector and is that a new dimension of the ceo’s job daniel vasella our industry has always been highly regulated but lately what we see is a paradox people seem to have less trust in government yet at the same time they seem to be asking governments to impose more regulations and it’s not just our industry compliance—with rules with regulations with societal values—is something that takes up more of a business leader’s time now than ever before mckinsey what about the increased pace of innovation is that changing the nature of the leader’s job as well daniel vasella we definitely see this trend in our industry the applications of computing and genetics to the biomedical field are exploding we can do much more today than we could ever do before we are on the verge of being able to decipher your genome for less than  we are moving to an era of socalled personalized medicine where we will be able choose the treatment knowing the specific nature of the disease in an individual in cancer treatment this is most advanced and of course technology has changed the way everyone communicates when i look around today everybody’s on some sort of communication tool—a smartphone or ipad or laptop opening the computer is the first thing i do in the office every morning anyone anytime can contact me and in general i do respond the job is   days a year mckinsey do you delegate email to someone else daniel vasella no i don’t like to do that mckinsey doesn’t that make it hard to control your agenda daniel vasella well i don’t pretend to be in control of my agenda that’s an illusion you can’t have a scheduler or an assistant who is a guard dog and tells whoever’s trying to get on your calendar “don’t even try” you want someone who is welcoming and accommodating but nevertheless is able to set boundaries mckinsey do you take the same approach to external communications and your interactions with the media daniel vasella people have a legitimate demand for access to the ceo but you have to modulate that so you avoid overexposure to the media you are a product and the press will paint you as either a hero or a villain—whatever sells so if they paint you as a hero today you should be prepared to be painted as a villain tomorrow not everything you do will work out every time and you have to accept that people will be unfair mckinsey to what extent should a leader share doubts and fears about things not working out with members of his team daniel vasella i believe that you have to be able to express doubt in your team and with a board if you don’t—and you pretend—then you are playing a role which others will sense rather easily leading to an unhealthy situation that’s not to say you should act like you’re in a confessional facing doubt you have to recognize if and when a decision is needed if it is you have to take the sword and cut through the gordian knot and make a decision despite any uncertainties this also raises the question of decision making and leadership are you being led by the context or do you set direction are you being led by your followers and are they choosing for you or do you choose and do you lead i think you have to be aware of the context and what people expect and hope for but as a leader you’re not there to feed people with all the things they hope for your job is to recognize the right goal and path forward and then to align and persuade people to do the things you believe will be relevant for the longterm success of the company people want you to lead and if you lead you will also hurt you will satisfy sometimes you will celebrate and you will blame that’s all part of your job you have to have the backbone and the integrity to be straight with people mckinsey can you teach those sorts of skills how do you think about your role in developing future leaders daniel vasella there are hard skills which are in some ways easier to transmit and there are soft skills which i find are much more difficult to teach you can teach concepts but you can’t teach experiences we know that to be a good leader it helps to be intelligent able to think conceptually leaders also have to have a certain level of ambition they need to be people who take pleasure in creating growing and building but those qualities need to be balanced by skepticism—recognition that not everyone wants you to succeed and that sometimes bad things happen and you have to be able to resist seduction if i look at all the reasons leaders fall it’s usually the soft factors i talk to my team about the seductions that come with taking on a leadership role there are many different forms sexual seduction money praise you need to be aware of how you can be seduced in order to be able to resist and keep your integrity mckinsey how can leaders stay grounded daniel vasella every ceo needs someone who can listen—a board member an adviser a partner—someone to whom he can speak in total confidence to whom he can say “i’ve had it” you need someone who understands and can help you to keep the balance leaders often forget the importance of stable emotional relationships—especially outside the company it helps tremendously to manage stress your partner will do a lot to help keep you in sync mckinsey what about the physical aspects of the leader’s role daniel vasella of course you need physical stamina you travel a lot and there are different time zones dinners and speeches and all kinds of other demands but i think psychological stamina is even more important you need to be able to switch on and switch off are you entirely present when you’re present and can you be entirely away when you’re away you need to have a moment when you say “i’m home now” and work is gone article actions share this article on linkedin share this article on twitter share this article on facebook email this

wednesday  january   gmt email this to a friend printable version profile novartis chief daniel vasella by jorn madslien bbc news business reporter in basel switzerland daniel vasella is in reflective mood when you experience disease and death early on you realise that time is not endless as chairman and chief executive of novartis the worlds fifth largest drug company the yearold medical doctor is acutely aware of both his powers and his responsibilities dr vasella comes across as gentle and philosophical even humble yet he also reveals a pragmatic approach to life and business travelling salesman dr vasella was a late entrant to the world of private enterprise  results sales rose  to bn net profits rose  to bn novartis forecasts soaring sales while still in his early thirties he was a physician having risen to become head of a hospital but his world crumbled the young doctor suffered a breakdown that would force him to reconsider everything psychotherapy proved to be the answer he now describes it as a lifesaving experience that freed him from his past it is not a crisis it is a recognition of who you are what you like how you want to live your life he says so he made a decision which at the time must have seemed more foolhardy than gutsy in  he quit his job at the hospital and moved to new jersey to become a travelling salesman for the swiss drugs firm sandoz pitching medicines to general practitioners dr vasella soon rose within the ranks at sandoz working in brand and product management before returning to switzerland in  to take charge of world marketing two years later he was crowned as sandozs chief executive you obviously have to enjoy business have a successful company and make money but it cannot be the end goal dr daniel vasellanovartis live novartis share price by then dr vasellas entry into the pharmaceutical sector had come to dominate his life powerhouse in  the young looking doctor announced big news at a hastily organised press conference at londons city airport a new global pharmaceutical giant had just been created following the merger of cibageigy and sandoz and he would be in charge critics pointed out that dr vasella was relatively inexperienced and there were also accusations of nepotism his wife of  years annelaurence is the niece of a former sandoz chairman but nine years later dr vasella has won over most of his critics by building novartis into a pharmaceutical powerhouse to be reckoned with last year he was named the most influential european business leader of the last  years in a poll of financial times readers then in october he was appointed president of the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers and associations accountability dr vasellas success has brought him considerable personal wealth in  his basic salary of  m was part of a m pay package which made him one of the best paid bosses in europe profits provide freedom this enables him to live an enviable existence on the edge of zugersee lake a minute commute from basel but he is not one for the high life preferring skiing or scuba diving with his three teenage children or riding his motorcycle money he insists is not the main driving factor in his life you obviously have to enjoy business having a successful company and making money but it cannot be the end goal he says instead he is driven by a sense of purpose that has largely evolved from a cruel string of personal tragedies when he was eight he had tuberculosis and meningitis and was kept out of school for a year when he was  one of his older sisters died from cancer his father died when he was  then years later his other sister died in a car accident when you experience disease and death early on you realise that time is not endless dr vasella says wealthcare dr vasella has a firm focus on the needs of patients  or customers  though he also firmly believes that investors profit requirements have to be met i have modified my position to say that the customer comes first but im also working for shareholders he says to this end dr vasella has pushed through some radical changes that have rocked the swiss establishment at novartis old style incestuous boardroom arrangements  which in the past tied swiss business and banking tightly together  have been discarded in favour of strict and transparent corporate governance rules that invite scrutiny from the outside internally he encourages open debate showing weakness among good people builds trust dr vasella declares transparency is an outstanding mechanism to keep you on the right track for novartis the right track is the fast track having emerged pretty much unscathed from last years lost takeover battle for the francogerman drugs firm aventis novartis is currently the fastest growing of the industrys giant firms and very profitable at that healthcare dr vasella truly believes his aggressive drive for commercial success is what enables him to release his compassionate energy money is a tool its a real tool if i sign a deal for bn or bn its abstract showing weakness among good people builds trust if money can move mountains then novartis is well placed to take on the job its cash reserves run into billions of dollars so the question comes up about what do you do with it dr vasella says it raises the question of accountability and to whom novartis has never been coy about its relentless search for new blockbuster drugs and to this end the group spends vastly more on research and development rd than its drugindustry rivals consequently its pipeline is full of promise for patients suffering from hypertension cancer or diabetes i dont care about technological progress as such only if mankind can take advantage is it important he insists feverishly defending the industrys oft criticised tendency to channel rd budgets into searches for new drugs that will enjoy commercial success rather than for drugs treating patients with rare ailments profits provide freedom he points out when deciding on where to channel its rd budgets dr vasella explains novartis goes medical need but also economic need i find this legitimate it makes sense ethically and financially drugs for the poor this free market formula may work in a wealthy society but it falls apart when it comes to the search for malaria drugs antiretroviral drugs or other medicines for developing world diseases dr vasella acknowledges but that he insists is not merely the fault of pharmaceutical companies rich western nations and corrupt governments in poor countries should also be blamed for any failure to help i think its a common responsibility he says insisting both novartis and many of its competitors are pulling their weight for instance novartis and the novartis foundation for sustainable development provide free treatment for all leprosy patients in the world malaria drugs are provided at cost via the world health organisation in the us the company provides social investment to improve healthcare for some of the  million people without health insurance is it perfect it is not perfect but we also have to learn to move ahead with things that are not perfect i think it is better to do something than nothing dr vasella says i think shareholders can protest if they dont like it but you know they dont

also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
