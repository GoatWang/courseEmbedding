to adorn the kerala assembly simultaneously ganesh kumar became transport minister in the a k antony cabinet in may 00 and went on to give a good account of himself though a political novice at that time he turned around the ailing ksrtc kerala state road transport corporation and earned a reputation for providing a clean and efficient administration in march 00 he stepped down from his

married bindhu menon on  january 0 who works as marketing head in asianet film careeredit ganesh kumar made his debut in the  malayalam film ‘irakal directed by kg george the film was adjudged the second best film for the year over the years he made his a mark on the silver screen as a supporting actor performing a variety of roles during the last two decades since 00 he has been balancing his role as mla with his acting duties indicating his unwillingness to give up his first love ganesh kumars early films saw him frequently donning the role of villain or antisocial in cheppu  he played the rowdy college student to perfection experimenting with brown sugar leading an ruly pack and taunting the noble professor played by mohanlal eventually the hero beats the daylights out of him and after some ugly display of blood and tears the movie comes to a predictable end in rakuyilin ragasadassil ganesh kumar played a wayward guitarist who turns over a new leaf after settling down with a nice girl this is in stark contrast to the story of the lead pair his brother and musical genius played by mammooty and the talented danseuse played by suhasini who part ways soon after the birth of their son only to reunite in a tearful climax other films of the eighties where ganesh made minor appearances include sukhamodevi  sarvakalasala  bhoomiyile rajakkanmaar  mukthi  and devadas  during the nineties ganesh kumar played notable supporting roles in various films the current decade saw ganesh kumar emerge as a significant player on the political scene after his election to the kerala state legislative assembly in 00 and his accession to the ministerial chair the same year followed by his dramatic exit in 00 to accommodate his father and party supremo r balakrishna pillai his subsequent reelection in 00 overcoming a statewide proldf wave saw him firmly established as a rising star on the political firmament of the state all this did not deter him from relentlessly pursuing his acting career however he seems to have chosen his roles with some measure of caution somewhere along the way ganesh kumar abandoned the garb of the villain and took up the mantle of the good samaritan perhaps reflecting his societal roles and obligations he acted in pilots and dada sahib in the year  in kilichundan mampazham 00 he played the heroines brother ummer in vismayathumbathu 00 ganesh kumar played a medical college professor he also acted in photographer 00 hello 00 chembada 00 and veruthe oru bharya 00 the film lion starring dileep and kavya madhavan released in 0 was inspired by ganesh kumars life krishna kumar played by dileep is the innocent son of an unscrupulous father struggling to build a political base in the midst of deceit intrigue and cutthroat competition his father quite aptly named balagangadhara menon is a seasoned and corrupt politician and he has two diabolic sonsinlaw to assist him in his dark deeds how the son grew up to be so virtuous is a total mystery the film despite the exaggerated and unrealistic story line was a thorough entertainer and did extremely well at the box office in march 00 ganesh kumar was chosen by the frame media gallup poll to receive the best actor award for his role in the amrita tv serial aliyanmarum penganmarum he went on to win the state award for best television actor 00 for his role in the
