one container of additive necessary for processing this installation should require at least  container loads of additive per year the npw produces  metric tons per day of biodiesel from either waste vegetable oil or animal fat with no preprocessing ecolocap’s process utilizes nanotechnology and proprietary additive both factors in reducing production costs the ecolocap technology can process feedstock with free fatty acid ffa of up to  into astm grade biodiesel feedstock with high ffa being much less expensive represents another factor in reducing the cost of the finished product the ecos efficiency claims are based upon sidebyside comparison with the traditional steps required to synthesize biodiesel the ecos npw uses an automatic batch flow which has only one processing step the ecos process reduces the oils to nanosized particles less than  micron and the process is independent of the amounts of ffa nano sized particles take on unusual properties the solubility product and miscibility change and physical separations can occur on a molecular level the addition of the additive performs the conversion of the fatty acids into glycerin not glycerol the biodiesel resulting meets or exceeds all astm requirements the glycerin produced by the ecos process is pharmaceutical grade and can be sold as is to the cosmetic pharmaceutical and food industries there are no other byproducts of manufacturing and no catalysts to recover the ecos cost is a minimum of  less than standard transesterification jerry mccalla president of r energy stated “with the npw we initially plan to produce some  gallons of high quality biodiesel per day however we have the capacity to produce over five times that quantity after the first unit is operative we plan to order additional equipment in order to reach that potential this means a lot for our industry and could be a major factor in the alternative fuel market we also will take advantage of ecolocap’s glycerin refining process that will extract glycerin from biodiesel to medical grade purity this will represent a welcome additional bonus for our operation” michael siegel president and ceo of ecolocap stated “we are pleased to
