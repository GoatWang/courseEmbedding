statistical measurement of the range of a funds total returns in general a higher standard deviation means greater volatility based on the funds monthly returns over the year period ended as of the date of the calculation a statistical measurement of a funds historical riskadjusted performance it is calculated by taking a funds excess return over that of the threemonth treasury bill divided by its standard deviation higher values generally indicate better historical riskadjusted performance based on the  years ended as of the date of the calculation the annualized percentage difference between a funds actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk as measured by beta based on the year period ended as of the date of the calculation the funds day

box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along
