mascos people development strategy at work turning to slide four im pleased to report that the momentum we built in  and carried forward into the first quarter of  has continued yeartodate we had a great second quarter as strength in our underlying markets combined with solid execution translated into excellent financial results looking specifically at the quarter our topline increased by  notably our adjusted operating margin increased  basis points to  reflecting our portfolios strong operating leverage a favorable price commodity environment and our culture of continuous cost improvement this represents our best secondquarter operating margin since  our adjusted eps grew  to  per share which includes the  million additional interest expense we incurred during the quarter due to the early retirement of a portion of our debt these results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving endmarket dynamics and our ability to generate robust consumer demand from our industryleading brands id like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments performance lets begin with plumbing our portfolio of plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in north america by  and grew sales internationally by  in local currency this segments strong growth was broadbased with delta hansgrohe and brasscraft manufacturing our rough plumbing business each having record quarters for both sales and operating profit the delta and brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer and drive sales growth in both the retail and wholesale channels in north america while the hansgrohe and axor brands continue to gain share internationally watkins manufacturing our premier wellness and spa business within our plumbing segment also achieved a record sales quarter a good sign that consumer confidence continues to build as exemplified by these bigticket purchases our decorative architectural segment delivered a solid quarter despite being up against a tough comp as we pointed out on our last quarterly earnings call we continued our strong pro paint sales growth as a result of our mutual efforts with the home depot to grow and capture share in this channel and behr marquee a highpricepoint diy product continued to post exceptional yearoveryear comps behr was once again acknowledged as the quality leader by achieving a number one ranking from a leading consumer testing organization for its behr premium plus ultra exterior paint our behr products have now held the number one ranking for interior and exterior paint as well as exterior stains for four years running demonstrating our commitment to customerfocused awardwinning highquality products our investments in paint are paying off and we intend to continue to reinvest in this segment to drive profitable volume growth along with our partner turning to cabinets the team delivered yet another strong quarter growing our leadership position at retail and continuing to optimize sales mix by exiting lowmargin directtobuilder business as we described on our first quarter earnings call moving to windows and other specialty products our sales grew by  but we did not meet our operating profit expectations were working diligently to address this underperformance and remain confident in our longterm operating margin expectations of  to  for this segment that we outlined in our investor day overall we are very pleased with our second quarter operating performance additionally we continued progress against our key capital allocation initiatives including finalizing our debt transactions and paying down  million in debt repurchasing approximately  million shares bringing our total shares repurchase todate to  million against our  million repurchase authorization and lastly our board of directors announcing its intention to increase our annual dividend by  per share beginning in the fourth quarter expressing confidence in our future outlook with that id like to turn the call over to john who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail john john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer thank you keith and good morning everyone as dave mentioned most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges our focused execution continued as we delivered strong top and bottom line growth in north america and internationally the second quarter of  was our th consecutive quarter of yearoveryear sales and operating profit growth sales increased  for the quarter the impact of foreign currency translation softened in the second quarter and negatively impacted our revenue by approximately  million north american sales were up  in the quarter we continued to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offerings as a reminder repair and remodel activity accounts for approximately  of our total sales international sales increased  in local currency in the quarter driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses gross margins expanded  basis points compared to the second quarter of last year to  and our track record of sga improvement continued in the second quarter as sga as a percent of sales improved  basis points driven by focused cost control and productivity improvement throughout the organization we delivered very strong bottom line performances as operating profit increased  to  million with operating margins expanding  basis points to  our highest second quarter margin in  years our eps was  in the quarter an improvement of  or  compared to the second quarter of  these results include the  million of onetime interest payment we noted in last quarters earnings call to complete the retirement of debt maturities this negatively impacted our eps turning to slide seven our plumbing segment had a terrific second quarter segment sales increased  excluding the impact of currency driven by growth in our faucets showers spas and rough plumbing products foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segments sales by approximately  million in the quarter our north american sales grew  in the second quarter we experienced strong demand for our innovative delta and brizo brands with both our wholesale and large retail customers as we gained share in the quarter our second quarter sales also benefited by approximately  million due to loanin sales associated with a recent retail program win our international plumbing sales increased  in local currency hansgrohe continues to outperform as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the companys history breaking the record they set last quarter we experienced sales growth around the globe with particular strength in central and northern europe the americas and asia additionally our mix improved as our premium price point axor brand grew doubledigits in the quarter operating profit for this segment increased  in the quarter driven by incremental volume productivity improvements and a favorable pricecommodity relationship particularly in europe this segment also benefited from a positive yearoveryear commodity hedge impact of approximately  million the second half of  we anticipate investing approximately  million in advertising and displays to support new product launches at both delta and brizo given this segments sustained performance improvement but also taking into account further investments to grow the business we are raising our longterm operating margin expectations for the segment from  to  to the high teens turning to slide eight the decorative architectural segment sales matched the second quarter of  we experienced solid performance of our behr marquee interior product and continued strong growth across our behr pro business however as i mentioned on the first quarter call this segment faced a difficult comp in q as the second quarter of  was a record sales quarter for behr in the second quarter of  the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense for the memorial day and july th promotional events negatively impacted our revenues you may recall last years july th event was entirely in q while this years event straddled q and q additionally sales were negatively impacted by an instore inventory drawdown late in the second quarter of  liberty hardware had another solid quarter due to the continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel we are also pleased that liberty was recently awarded the final portion of a nationwide shower door program at the home depot we will be resetting the remaining plus stores with this innovative program in the fourth quarter operating profit increased  million in the second quarter principally due to operating leverage on higher volume at behr and liberty while we have experienced solid margins in the first half of the year we will invest to grow gallons in the second half of  at this time we expect the amount of this investment to be approximately  million the majority of which will be spent in the third quarter turning to slide nine we are extremely pleased with our cabinet segments improved performance in q segment sales declined  due to the deliberate exit of certain lowermargin business within the builder direct channel in the united states and at select lowmargin accounts in our uk cabinet business this decline was partially offset by kraftmaids strong performance in the retail channel resulting in doubledigit growth in yearoveryear share gains in the dealers channel we drove singledigit growth through increased volume and favorable mix with both our merillat offerings and our dealerexclusive kraftmaid vantage program continued to resonate with our dealer base and consumers segment profitability in the second quarter improved  million or  over  our strong second quarter margin of  was driven by costsavings initiatives as well as an improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lowermargin builder direct business and enjoyed  continued growth of our higher price point semicustom kraftmaid offering for the balance of  we believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select builder direct business and our retail kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by approximately  million in both q and q in addition during the second half of  we will be launching new products under the kraftmaid and quality brands and anticipate approximately  million of expense associated with these new product introductions finally given this segments sustained performance improvement we are raising our longterm expectations for operating margins from  to  to low to midteens turning to slide  our windows segment sales increased  driven by growth in milgard our leading western us window business milgards continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing excluding the negative impact of stronger us dollars our european window sales increased  as this segment continues to benefit from share gains through the strong performance of our premium price point window and door offerings this segments operating profit declined was due to erp expenses in milgard of approximately  million which we previously disclosed and an adjustment to milgards warranty reserve of approximately  million in addition we experienced approximately  million of incremental labor costs and inefficiencies as milgard continues to grow despite this quarters results we continue to believe this segment will achieve  to  operating margins longterm turning to slide  during the quarter we took additional action to further strengthen our balance sheet and unlock shareholder value we ended the quarter with approximately  billion of balance sheet liquidity as we mentioned last quarter in march we issued  million of new notes then in midapril we used the proceeds from these debt issuances together with cash on hand to repay and also  retire all of our  billion notes due in october  and all of our  million notes which were due in march of  to complete the retirement of these two debt maturities we incurred approximately  million in a onetime interest payment during the quarter which increased our interest expense to  million for the second quarter however the results of these transactions will generate an annual interest expense savings of nearly  million starting with our third quarter of  our quarterly interest expense will be approximately  million with these refinancing transactions we have delivered on our longterm commitment to strengthen our balance sheet due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as our net debt to ebitda now stands at approximately  times from a working capital perspective we delivered another strong quarter of performance with working capital as a percent of sales improving  basis points versus the prior year to  finally as keith mentioned we continued our share repurchase activities and during the quarter we repurchased  million shares valued at approximately  million so with that ill now turn the call back over to keith keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director thank you john im pleased with our teams continued strong execution our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and our rigorous focus on operational excellence due to our continued success in these areas we are raising our longterm margin expectations for our plumbing segment to the high teens and for our cabinet segment to the low to midteens the fundamentals driving our business continue to accelerate home prices continue to appreciate which is a driver for larger ticket items such as cabinets and windows housing turnover continues to increase which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend and as you recall repair and remodel is  of our business and homes remain affordable with improving access to credit as well as lower mortgage rates stimulating housing and home improvement activity consumers continue to gain confidence to reinvest in their homes and we are wellpositioned to benefit from those positive trends the strategies that we laid out last year are working going forward we remain committed to investing behind our brands for growth developing innovative awardwinning products to ensure we maintain our musthave position with our customers focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the masco operating system and finally balancing our capital allocation between investing for growth acquisitions with the right strategic fit and returns and returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends we remain very confident in achieving our  earnings per share target of  that we set at our investor day last year our operational execution coupled with our strength in balance sheet and strong liquidity position provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value with that id like to open up the call for questions so ill throw it back to you jonathan questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from dennis mcgill with zelman  associates please go ahead dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc hi good morning thank you first question just relates to the push in margin for the two segments when you guys are talking about longterm is that a yeardependent measure or are you thinking about that as a certain amount of revenue in each segment or a certain macro backdrop can you just maybe update us on how that ties in to the prior  outlook and timing keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director dennis i would say that its consistent with the macroeconomic outlook that we had in  so i would frame it in that manner and in terms of the timing of it were looking at that as a multiyear more longerterm outlook on what we expect from a runrate out of these businesses dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc okay and then maybe so if we bridge from today to that longerterm view are the incremental margins in the two businesses different than how youve talked about or similar just from a stronger starting point today keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director no i think incrementally the margins are going to get a little bit better as were going to maintain some of that gross margin improvement of course theres some offsets to that as we talked about with regards to investment john maybe you want to add a little bit to that john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer yeah dennis i would say that our incremental margin outlook for the businesses hasnt changed significantly i think were still in that kind of  for plumbing and that  to  for cabinetry dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc okay and if i could just sneak it in john could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the windows the three different expenses or related expenses you mentioned are those intertwined in that the erp is causing the labor inefficiencies and then also on the warranty reserve any color there would be great john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer yeah ill take a little bit of it and i think keiths going to want to talk just a bit about the operational aspect of it so i think theyre three very distinct items dennis so the erp is separate and discrete from the other things so that was about  million in the quarter we brought up our portland facility on the system and so we incurred a little bit more than we expected to incur by  million or so dollars just given the way that went but its going well were shipping product out of portland and so were pleased with that the second item relates to our warranty accrual adjustment and what we do there is on a very regular basis we look at all of our accruals across the company and as we looked at some of our experience and some of our assumptions going forward we thought it was appropriate to change the reserve and so thats reflected in what – the adjustments that we took this quarter then ill turn it over to keith to talk about the operational aspect of things keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director dennis id say that its not uncommon for a business to hit some speed bumps along the way especially when youre looking at the growth that milgard has experienced weve had midsingle to lowdouble digit growth for each of the past  quarters so weve had a lot of growth there individually or separately these items really arent a big issue but collectively theyve got our attention we have teams addressing these issues aggressively and were confident that were going to get back and maintain and get to our margin expectations of that  to  dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc okay appreciate all the color good luck guys keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director thanks operator your next question comes from bob wetenhall with rbc capital markets please go ahead robert wetenhall  rbc capital markets llc hey good morning and congrats on a very encouraging quarter and a positive outlook trying to understand if you could help me frame it a little bit better in thinking about it the results are really strong and youre taking up your longterm profitability and margin targets whats the mix here in the divisions where youre increasing the margin targets longterm between selfhelp and strength of the cycle whats giving you that confidence to say hey weve already gotten where we want to be faster and heres what were thinking about in the next couple years keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director well as you might expect bob it is a mix between a strong market which we expect to continue going forward and our execution i look it at it – we as a team look at it from a number of ways the nature of our cost out how are we driving the productivity improvements that were seeing and are they sustainable are they systemic are they based on the approaches that were driving in the masco operating system and quite frankly we look at the people and we look at the teams and we evaluate how those teams are successfully implementing our operating systems and the nature of the improvements that theyre driving so when we look at sustained performance improvement we look at how its come to us and we looked at the people that are driving it and the confidence that we have in those teams those things all together have said you know were comfortable in taking our margins up to the high teens in plumbing which is very very solid business and taking them up in cabinets as weve described robert wetenhall  rbc capital markets llc got it and thats helpful thank you could you elaborate a little bit more on in the paint business the profitability was really good you guys had previously commented that there would be kind of a longterm multiquarter glide path towards a normalized margin of  and i was trying to understand the margin profile the strength of it in this quarter and any update you can give us on whats happening in doityourself sales versus pro channel thanks and good luck very nice quarter john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer thanks bob in terms of our performance in paint i think theres a couple things to think about as we talk about that glide path closer to the high teens  range were very pleased with the performance of the segment this quarter and the progress that weve made but as weve talked about historically well be investing in this business over the longterm to help grow gallons i think theres a couple three things that may influence the margin pressure downward first is commodities we have been experiencing some mild commodity cost inflation from our major suppliers of titanium dioxide and as i think everyones aware theyve announced further price increases for later this year the second is investments as weve talked about historically we are trying to grow this business and grow gallons in conjunction with our channel partner the home depot and so were investing heavily to grow our pro business in fact we are investing here in the back half of  sic   part of the  million investment that i outlined in my prepared remarks really goes to growing hub stores we have  new hub stores where well be employing people to help grow our paint business in the home depot and finally mix i think weve mentioned very clearly over the course of the last couple quarters our pro business does not have or come at the same margin profile as our core diy business so i think those are the three elements that over time will drive the margins closer to that high teens range from where were at and from where we stand today in the  range keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director bob in terms of your specific question on the pro our pro business continues to do very well we grew in that low doubledigit range again in the quarter our investments and strategies that we are driving together with the home depot are paying off very well and were encouraged with the trajectory as john mentioned were adding  new hub stores and thats on top of an install base of hub stores of  so this very productive for us we like what were seeing in the pro and were going to continue it operator your next question comes from eric bosshard with cleveland research company please go ahead eric bosshard  cleveland research co llc thanks two questions for you first of all curious in what youre observing in terms of remodel spending obviously the plumbing numbers look good in the quarter but within the cabinet business if you can exclude the business you walked away from what youre seeing in terms of order rates and order patterns there and then secondly would love you to elaborate a little bit further on the expected payback from the incremental investment that youre making in the paint business obviously youre talking that that may normalize or dilute the margins but should this also accelerate the top line growth keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director eric in terms of the remodeling side we continue to see good demand i think home price appreciation is a good driver for that and there has been some deferral in investing in bigticket items that folks have put into their homes for a number of years and thats coming off the sideline as we talk to the various dealer and constituents around our business were hearing about good foot traffic and continued good spend in the cabinet and window business which both of those have a very strong component of rr in them we are seeing improved mix as well now a part of that is driven by productive changes weve made to our assortment and how were managing the business but its also a general uptick in mix in terms of the market i think a great indicator is our watkins spa business as john said we set another sales record there this quarter and when you consider the discretionary nature of this product and its high price point it really reflects on the consumers appetite to reinvest in their home so were seeing the consumers utilize credit more with larger ticket purchases such as spas so i think the consumer is feeling confident thats a direct reflection on demand in rr and then of course home price appreciation and new housing turnover all which are continuing to grow which continue to feed that with regards to your second question eric around the incremental payback on the pro initiative its an outstanding payback for us its very profitable while it doesnt have necessarily the margin of our core diy business it has outstanding returns for us and i think importantly the fact that we are so intertwined strategically with home depot that this is a very positive revenue source for us for quite a while were very confident in the pro and paint john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer yes and eric can you just give a little bit more color i think part of your question was how did our cabinet business grow if you factor out the business that we walked away from and if you just take a look at our core business thats excluding that builder walk away business that we did our core business was up kind of   in the quarter eric bosshard  cleveland research co llc and it looks like youre gaining market share how do you view that relative to the market and what was that number in the first quarter john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer yes thats right eric i think your assessment is right we feel like were picking up a little bit of share particularly in retail we know were picking up share for certain there the first quarter if you strip everything out i think we had very similar growth rates in the first quarter of the year and that business is a business that we did not walk away from eric bosshard  cleveland research co llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from michael rehaut with jpmorgan please go ahead michael jason rehaut  jpmorgan securities llc thanks good morning everyone and nice quarter first question i had was on the paint margins just want to make sure im thinking about it correctly because i guess you highlighted  million of extra expense in the third quarter which could be around  bps  bps of a margin impact at the same time you highlighted the promotional expense which hits more the top line and im sure that also contributed to the margin strength itself so looking into q i know you dont get too granular here but given that i wouldnt expect the full  bps  bps to hit because of a lesser amount of promotional expense should it kind of return to that highteens type of number that youre looking at longer term or could it still exceed  john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer yes mike first of all the  million of expense will not be entirely in q thats going to be split between q and q though the majority of which i would estimate will hit in the third quarter and so as you think about the margin degradation from where we stand today to future quarters i think the scenario that you outlined yes i think well see consistent or steady margin degradation im not expecting necessarily a clip  back to  but i think over time well drive that way so i think high teens low s could be an opportunity for the third quarter but as you referenced we dont give out quarterly guidance michael jason rehaut  jpmorgan securities llc okay no thanks but just again trying to think of it the right way switching back to cabinet growth if we can get a little more detail there if possible i dont recall hearing the exact or estimated dollar amount of the impact of the exited businesses this quarter and then i guess maybe you can give some of the pluses and minuses because if its even  million  million that would imply kind of that best like a low singledigit sales growth rate so just trying to think about how that might improve over time to like a midsingledigit if there are other drags that are holding back that business as wed expect some of the new product initiatives and share gains to take greater hold john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer yes mike so we had about  million to  million of lost business this quarter from the exit of the directtobuilder in the retail countertop business im going to tell you that that our retail business grew in lowdouble digits and our dealer business grew at about single digits so you put all that together if you factor out again the business that we walked away from our core business grew about   michael jason rehaut  jpmorgan securities llc and is that a good run rate for the back half as well excluding the exit of the lowmargin business keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director yes i think thats a good way to think about it weve got good traffic that were seeing in our dealer customers we have good mix were excited about the product launches that we have coming in in q and q now its going to take some while for that to get traction as the designers start to get comfortable with it but its good stuff and we like the prospects for the business and nice steady growth rate and continued execution importantly michael jason rehaut  jpmorgan securities llc thanks one last quick one if i could just on the labor inefficiencies and erp expense and other specialty should that start to peel off in q and excluding youre about at  excluding the warranty hit this quarter could we see that improve into midsingle digit somewhere in the like midsingle digit margin i know again maybe not giving the guidance for that but some of the erp or labor would that kind of be lesser of a headwind in the back half john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer we have an ongoing roll out of erp mike at milgard and so i would anticipate  million to  million of erp expense each of the next several quarters and that will probably go into the first part of  –  i should say as we continue to roll it out across all of milgards manufacturing locations so that will continue keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director in terms of the labor let me take that one john the nature of the issue that were having here is really about supporting the high growth with additional labor and labor turnover so this is probably our toughest business when it comes to being in the northwest and getting our labor and keeping our labor with this growth we drive hard with respect to getting as much as we can out of our existing shifts and when you put in new second shifts theres always a learning curve for that bringing in some new supervision so i think well probably see some labor inefficiencies bleed into next quarter a little bit but were on this and were going to get it taken care of quickly michael jason rehaut  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks guys operator your next question comes from samuel eisner with goldman sachs please go ahead samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co yes good morning everyone john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer good morning sam samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co on the plumbing segment i just want to make sure i got the moving pieces correctly here you commented that there was about  million of revenue loadin assumed thats  margin so about  million of ebit and you had a  million hedging benefit as well are those the only two major items in a bridge that we should be modeling or thinking about for this quarter just because obviously the profitability in this quarter was pretty substantial john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer yes no sam i think youre thinking about it exactly right samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co got it thats helpful there the  million for next quarter is that essentially offsetting some of the walk savings for the hedging losses that you had in the third quarter as well john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer no the  million really is for next quarter the second half of the year really it really is some product launches that were doing now i would tell you the other thing that probably impacts the second quarter sam that i forgot to mention probably is were  on marketing spend in the second quarter so i think youll see that grow as we go into the third and fourth quarter and then theres  million of expense related to these product launches if the collateral material displays and the like gets the products into our either our channel partners or the wholesale showrooms where were launching these products samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co got it maybe transitioning over to the paint segment you commented that youre starting to see some price increases by your tio suppliers when do you anticipate some of that to start to impact your pl and how are you guys going to go about offsetting that do we expect that back half of the year that youd start to see a raw material headwind how do you think about the whole pricecost relationship going forward john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer in terms of that generally we have a to day lag before raw material price increases flow through and hit our financial statements so i think youll start seeing the impact of the second quarter increase really hit our third quarter and then to the extent that there are further increases later in the year you can again calibrate those on those to day timeframe where it flows through in terms of how do we offset obviously we work with our suppliers very closely on that were working on cost productivity within our own operations to try to offset some of that that said i think weve got a good thing going right now with our pro business and our marquee business that seems like its heading in the right direction so hopefully as consumers mix up a little bit that will help offset some of that pricing pressure samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co all right and if i can just sneak one more in here keith you made the comment about were talking about rr spending how consumers are utilizing a bit more credit these days i was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more are you seeing that in the forms of people starting to use helocs and home equity loans again just curious if you can expand on that comment thanks keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director sure ill point you to our use of credit and our – just a direct little statistic here in terms of thirdparty consumer financing program that we have in our watkins spa business yeartodate that volume is up  our instore approval rates are up nearly  and applications are up  so thats one example there and certainly helocs is another one where people are starting to pull that value out of their home but very much close to home is that credit financing that we see in watkins which is for a bigticket item so we think thats a great sign for consumer confidence and it shows a willingness to invest in that biggerticket item for the home operator your next question comes from tim wojs with baird please go ahead tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker yes hey guys good morning nice job john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer thanks tim tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker i guess just on decorative you had made the comment that behr was up year over year from a volume basis could you expand a little bit maybe what gallon growth was in behr for q and then the inventory reduction you that cited is that over or is there some residual impact to think about for q john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer so gallon growth is up lowsingle digits in the second quarter in terms of the inventory reduction we think its largely behind us though we continue to monitor that i would tell you though that our sellthrough with our channel partner was better than our sellin to the channel partner in the quarter tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker okay okay and then maybe just a biggerpicture question you guys have done a really nice job deleveraging the balance sheet and so i know youre paying more dividends and youre still buying back stock but how do you think about the aggression or the intensity within the ma program particularly in decorative and plumbing going forward keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director tim we laid out a balanced approach to capital allocation last year at the investor day its working for us and we plan to continue to do that as we talked about weve repurchased  million shares against our  million share authorization we paid down debt of  million –  million excuse me lots of zero increased our dividend twice so we like the balance that this has given us with specific regard to acquisition were focused on bolton acquisitions as weve said were not changing our strategy and specifically on paint and plumbing we would look and are looking in other areas but our focus is on paint and plumbing our pipeline is growing in terms of absolute size and were seeing accelerated movement of targets through our pipeline as we develop them develop relationships and start to understand better how we could add value were being prudent i would say careful in making sure that our acquisition targets and a deal should we do it would bring good value were very disciplined in looking for the appropriate return on our investment and the ability for us to bring synergies to it so no real change to our capital allocation or our ma strategy anything thats significantly different from what weve talked about for the better part of a yearandahalf or so i would tell you that i like our balanced approach because it gives us flexibility but our strategy is unchanged in this area tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker great keep up the good work keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director thank you john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer will do operator your next question comes from mike wood with macquarie please go ahead mike wood  macquarie capital usa inc hi congratulations on cabinets can you talk about the rate of margin improvement by channel between retail and dealer where its happening faster or beating your expectations particularly on price and in that same vein if you could talk about the impact the common erp system is having in terms of price and service keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director in terms of where the improvements of margin are coming a channelbychannel basis the lions share of our margin improvements is operationally based and its very hard to detangle that its reflected in both channels of distribution so the biggest change in margin from a costout perspective is really shared between the channels when you look at where were having the most margin productivity in terms of price if you will id point to the dealer side where were getting mix and thats been very helpful weve come out now some time ago with the kraftmaid vantage program which really gives some differentiation to the dealers and were seeing that be very productive and that continues to raise in terms of the percentage of mix of our overall sell and so id look at our margin as a combination of course theres factory and shop floor improvements that are shared by both segments and then particularly in dealer the mixup is helping us and ill tell you were excited about the new products weve got – john talked about and i summarized about the investments that we have in the back half around new products for both kraftmaid as well as our quality brands so from my perspective that pipeline for continuing our improvement in this segment is important and were hitting it mike wood  macquarie capital usa inc great and also as a follow up what feedback are you getting from the builders with the product exits that youre seeing are they shifting to lowerend cabinets from other manufacturers are you getting any builders coming back to the large manufacturers such as yourself keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director i havent really seen the price point of the replacement for the work that were walking away from and how thats being replaced i suspect its at a relatively consistent level of pricing and et cetera in terms of whos getting that business its really not the big nationals what were seeing more often than that – substantially more often than that is the regional players mike wood  macquarie capital usa inc thank you operator your next question comes from nishu sood with deutsche bank please go ahead nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc thank you first question i wanted to ask was in the plumbing category specifically digging into the north american business terrific sales performance there theres already been some discussion of big ticket and in the spa business across the kind of main delta portfolio what were you seeing in terms of what sorts of products were driving that very strong sales gains obviously we saw a lot of design improvements at the trade shows early this year so what are you seeing there and what has been driving that very strong sales growth keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director its really broad based in our core business and through both wholesale distribution and repair and remodeling were seeing nice unit volume and that delta brand is very well known for those customers that are in that price point and were very pleased with the performance of our showroom brands which would be that higher end we mentioned our brizo brand which is the highend brand underneath delta faucet company thats doubledigit growth and running very well you look at our axor brand which is a highend brand within the hansgrohe organization that had doubledigit growth and then within the hansgrohe continuum of product the higher end is continuing to drive so im happy with our channel focus and the work that our sales folks are doing in the showroom thats very productive for us but the bread and butter of the core is doing as well in terms of unit volume john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer nishu what i would add to that is you may recall we had a very strong fourth quarter with our wholesale customers and therefore that led to a pretty soft q with those same customers because they had pulled forward some orders out of q into q as we look at the numbers i would tell you that we think that there was some replenishment going on particularly in the first part of the second quarter as they continued to fill lower inventories that helped made the second quarter top line nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc got it got it no thats very helpful and price commodity wise you mentioned in plumbing that that was a tailwind and obviously you talked a little bit about in paint the headwinds there as you look across just the kind of market pricing some of the metals prices are rising wood products as well the energy chain so i was just wondering if you could talk about how that might flow through across the separate divisions in the next couple of quarters and what your outlook is there please keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director yeah so i think theres a couple things there nishu to talk to you about brass which is the main component of our plumbing products is made of copper and zinc and zinc actually has risen pretty nicely over the course of the last couple of quarters its been up off its bottoms consistently if you take a look at copper copper really fell pretty dramatically in the november timeframe last year and really stayed low through kind of midjanuary and then it started to tick up from there and as weve said in the past it takes about two quarters for those impacts to flow through and hit our pl which is about the second quarter when that would – when we feel a lot of that impact so feel good about that looking around to our other product categories though not seeing a ton of inflation in our wood products at all weve seen a little bit of inflation but not much tio weve already spoken about petroleum has been up and down a little bit the one area that we did see a little bit of inflation and we called this out in our first quarter call was glass out in the western united states where a glass factory had gone down and so we had implemented price to offset that price increase that we incurred that said were working hard on our continuous improvement through our masco operating system to try to offset any of this inflation that we are incurring to continue to drive our margins even higher nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc great thank you operator your next question comes from susan maklari with ubs please go ahead susan marie maklari  ubs securities llc thank you good morning keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director good morning john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer good morning susan marie maklari  ubs securities llc it seems like doing some quick math here you did make some improvements in your working capital this quarter can you just talk a little bit about whats been going on there and are there further efforts that we can expect to see as you continue to maybe drive some efficiencies keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director lets talk about inventory first susan we really look at inventory as an indicator of how well our supply chain is doing we look at working capital as an indicator of how well our supply chain is doing so when we look at these improvements i think its really a reflection of the work that the teams have been doing in the factories and in our supply chain organizations to drive down and drive out waste in the shop floor through things like setup reduction and focused on onepiece flow and all of those fundamentals that we have as part of our operating system in terms of inventory from a supply chain perspective we look at and are constantly developing and improving our methodologies for identifying minimum order quantities and working with our suppliers so that we can get shorter supply chains so its a combination of a lot of work that were doing quite frankly susan i didnt expect us to be able to continue to improve to this degree if you look at where we are its pretty darn good i dont know if were best in breed in our peer group but i know were very close and the better you get the harder it is to get better were not going to stop but i wouldnt look for any material real improvements here but dont tell my guys that susan marie maklari  ubs securities llc okay all right sounds good and then in terms of the free cash generation i mean youve obviously done an amazing job there as well but as we think about your ability to perhaps drive some even moreimproved operating margins in these businesses is there any change to how youre thinking about your ability to generate free cash and how that could possibly trend looking out john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer no i dont think so susan as you cite as our free cash flow – as our profits continue to grow i think a couple of good things as keith just mentioned weve got working capital locked down pretty tight so as that continues to grow that should help our free cash flow our capital expense our capex is a relatively light touch weve been averaging around  just under  of sales for the last several years a little bit more than that this year as we completed a couple of investments that were making but after this year we do expect that to migrate that back down to kind of to that  of sales range so dont feel like theres significant investment to be poured back into the business as we continue to grow so that should really enhance our free cash flow in the next several years susan marie maklari  ubs securities llc okay great thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen we have time for one additional question mr mike dahl with credit suisse please go ahead michael g dahl  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi thanks for taking my questions a couple of questions around paint first obviously a lot of initiatives around kind of the pro and building that business i think interesting with the hub store roll out and doubling there could you just talk a little bit more about beyond this next  stores what the opportunity is and i guess as part of this is this really the mostsuccessful initiative that youve seen as far as what it actually takes to crack the code with the pro just any color around there keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director well this is a  billion market when you look at it and we look at where we are im happy with our growth rate certainly but i think theres a substantial runway for us to continue in working with the home depot to do better and better here the additional hub stores obviously were making that investment because it works but we still have a lot of value to generate here no question given the size of the market and given our relative newness were continuing to learn we have an outstanding team in paint and we have an outstanding partner in home depot and as ive talked about on several occasions to me its the interwoven strategy that we have with these guys and our cooperation and our relationship thats really driving a good chunk of this value and thats continuing to increase so im very positive on the outlook in pro and were going to continue to deploy our operating system against this initiative our people are developing were learning more were servicing the pro better were getting faster theres a lot of room for upside here michael g dahl  credit suisse securities usa llc broker and keith how much of the business is still going through a home depot store versus some of your directtocustomer initiatives keith j allman  president ceo  class ii director oh goodness most of it almost all of it john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer over  mike is going to the depot store very – almost nothings going directtocustomer michael g dahl  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thanks and then second question is around the liberty program wins john just wondering if you could give us a little color on just how to think about any potential loadin factor how much of the investments that you highlighted are related to this liberty program and how to think about kind of then an ongoing run rate for kind of sales there john g sznewajs  vice president and chief financial officer yeah so this program is something that liberty launched a couple of years ago and they won the west coast and then subsequently won the midwest region and now theyve won the balance of the united states with these plus stores that well be bidding in q in terms of the investment thats going to go – and it should be kind of in the order of magnitude of  million mostly in q mike when we set those stores there will be a bit of a loadin on that dont have a good estimate for you ill probably give you some greater clarity in q as we get closer to the launch of those – on the q call when we get to the launch of those stores but i got to tell you that the liberty team has just done a terrific job of coming up with new programs consistently new merchandising concepts which this really is and really enhancing their business with their channel partners so hats off to mark and the liberty team theyve done a great job of building that business michael g dahl  credit suisse securities

executive officer keith allman keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director thank you irene good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today turning to slide four we had a great start to  with q representing our th consecutive quarter of yearoveryear sales and profit growth all of our segments contributed to top line growth in local currency resulting in our north american sales increasing  and our international sales increasing  in local currency we delivered this growth while expanding our operating margin to  our strongest first quarter operating margin since  our focus on execution and cost containment continues to pay off as we improved our operating profit by  million while decreasing sga by  million or  basis points as a global company foreign exchange cost us  of eps in the quarter despite this headwind our adjusted eps grew  to  per common share this strong performance was augmented by several valuecreating initiatives we accomplished in the quarter we returned approximately  million to shareholders through our increased dividends and the repurchase of approximately  million shares of stock we announced an acquisition of endless pools by watkins a premiere spa business this acquisition allows watkins to expand its offering into the aquatic fitness category opening new channels of distribution and access to a new customer base the acquisition is reflective of a type of bolton opportunities we will continue to pursue additionally the spinoff of our installation services business topbuild remains on track for the middle of the year before turning the call over to john id like to highlight how our strategies and execution are driving results in our plumbing segment our longstanding commitment to innovation and design continues to propel our marketleading brands to new levels delta and hansgrohe once again broke records in the quarter and both experienced the highest sales quarters in their history behrs longstanding reputation as an industry leader in paint was reaffirmed jd power and associates ranked behr number one in customer satisfaction for interior paints you may recall that earlier this year behr was also rated number one in quality by a leading independent testing organization for its interior and exterior paints as well as stains these awards established behr as the number one ranked paint based on quality and customer satisfaction and only add to behrs brand awareness and brand equity milgard windows history of innovation continues to drive sales with essence windows and new multipanel glass doors improving our business mix our installation services business continues to benefit from a strategic expansion into commercial construction as well as targeted growth with custom builders finally joe gross was named president of our cabinetry business in midfebruary he and his team are already delivering on their turnaround plan with improved top and bottom line results with that ill turn the call over to john who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp thanks keith and good morning everyone please turn to slide six as irene mentioned most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges we started  with positive momentum from last year as keith mentioned the first quarter was our th consecutive quarter of yearoveryear sales and profit growth excluding the impact of foreign currency sales increased  and we experienced sales growth in all five segments on a reported basis sales grew  foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the first quarter by  million principally due to a weaker euro compared to the us dollar sales in north america were up  for the quarter as the us economy improves we are experiencing growing demand for our new home construction and repairremodeling products including big ticket repairremodeling products as a reminder repairremodel activity accounts for approximately  of our total sales international sales increased  in local currency in the quarter driven by the continued strength of our international plumbing business gross margins expanded approximately  basis points compared to q of last year to  our focus on cost control continues to pay off as keith mentioned sga spend declined by  million in the quarter despite a  million increase in revenue as a result sga as a percent of sales decreased  basis points to  our cost control enhanced our operating leverage as we generated a  incremental margin in the quarter we delivered strong bottom line performance as operating income increased  in the quarter to  million with operating margins expanding  basis points to  our highest first quarter margin since  and our eps was  an improvement of  or  compared to the first quarter of last year foreign currency negatively impacted operating profit in the quarter by  million or approximately  per share turning to slide seven our plumbing segment sales decreased  due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency the strength of the us dollar masked the terrific performance in q across our plumbing segment excluding the  million impact of foreign currency translation sales increased  driven by growth in faucets spas and new program wins with trade and retail partners as keith mentioned earlier both delta and hansgrohe enjoyed their best quarter for any period in their history we experienced strong growth in the trade channel in the quarter as delta and brizo brands drive consumer demand for our innovative new products and we continue to take share in this category our european businesses continue to outperform delivering  sales growth in local currency despite a strong midsingle digit comp from the first quarter of last year hansgrohes record quarter in local currency was driven by emerging market growth as well as the strength of hansgrohes brand design and innovation all of which were on display at the recent ish trade show in frankfurt operating profit decreased  driven primarily by unfavorable currency of  million and negative mix of  million as we further penetrate the emerging markets as we mentioned on our q earnings call sales marketing and trade show expenses due primarily to our participation in the biennial trade show in frankfurt impacted results by approximately  million this was partially offset by favorable price commodity relationships nearly all of which was incurred in our european businesses and increased volumes we look at these costs in q as investments for future growth and we believe this year plumbing segment margins will approximate the  to  that we experienced in  turning to slide eight in the decorative architectural segment first quarter sales increased  driven by the performance of our new behr marquee interior product and growth in our behrpro business as keith mentioned we are pleased that behr was ranked number one in the jd powers  paint satisfaction study in the interior paint category this recognition together with being ranked number one in interior paint exterior paint and exterior stains by a leading independent consumer testing organization establishes behr as a quality leader in the architectural coatings industry liberty hardware contributed to the top and bottom line growth through the continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel operating profit increased  in the first quarter due to increased volumes effective cost management and the deferral of approximately  million in advertising and promotional expenses related to the coatings business from the first quarter to later this year all of this was partially offset by some incremental expense at liberty as we mentioned in our q call we expect to incur approximately  million of incremental investments in  related to program wins at liberty hardware and the investment in behrs new color solution centers in the home depot these new color solution centers should be in all stores by memorial day in time for the kickoff of the painting season segment sales were impacted by  million of these expenses in q slightly lower than the  million we initially expected as a result of timing of some of these initiatives we still expect to incur approximately  million of incremental investment related to these programs and initiatives in  with q impacted by approximately  million q by  million and q by  million in addition to the  million we experienced in q turning to slide nine our cabinet segment sales increased  in the quarter due to improved performance of the kraftmaid brand in the home centers and with dealers the bottom line improved  million over the prior year driven primarily by improved mix as our higher price point kraftmaid experienced strong growth the reduction of prior years incremental spend and the benefits associated with other cost savings initiatives turning to installation on slide  our sales increased  in the quarter as a result of improved endmarket activity with the strongest growth coming from residential new home construction and commercial channels the growth in the residential new home construction was driven by strong singlefamily performance with both production and custom builders in addition topbuild was recently awarded energy star partner of the year by the epa for the th time for its home energy rating service this reflects topbuilds commitment to improving energy efficiency of homes in the us and a recognition of topbuilds expertise in building science our efforts to drive productivity and increase volume helped offset raw material price increases and wage inflation as operating profit increased  million and delivered  operating margins we are pleased that q is this segments first profitable first quarter since  and as keith mentioned were happy to report that were on track to execute the spinoff in the middle of the year turning to slide  our other specialty product segment sales increased  driven by low doubledigit sales growth in our north american window business this growth was driven by volume increases and the continued benefit of a favorable mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines excluding the impact of a negative impact of a stronger us dollar our european window sales increased  the segments operating profit growth in the quarter can be attributed to increased volumes and a favorable pricecommodity relationship which was partially offset by approximately  million of cost related to erp investment in milgard and the timing of advertising and display expense and turning to slide  we ended the quarter with about  billion of liquidity as a reminder this number reflects the  million year bond we issued in march to prefund our upcoming june   million maturity the issuance carrying cost is approximately  million nearly all of which will impact the second quarter and we continue to have strong performance in working capital working capital as a percent of sales came in at  a basis point improvement from the first quarter of last year and finally turning to slide  we continue to take initiatives to unlock shareholder value one of these initiatives was to increase our share repurchase activity as keith mentioned earlier during the first quarter we repurchased more than  million shares or approximately  of our common stock it is our expectation and we will allocate in total between  million and  million to share repurchases in  and we are wellpositioned to retire between  million and  million of debt in  that concludes my remarks so with that ill turn the call back over to keith keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director thank you john were really pleased with our strong start to the year and our continued ability to execute against a backdrop of strengthening demand for our industryleading products and services we started the year well we have good momentum as we move further into  and we remain confident in our outlook for the year we look forward to sharing more of the masco story and our growth plans with you next week at our investor day so with that id like to turn the call back over to laurel for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you ladies and gentlemen in order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question and one followup question during the qa session your first question comes from the line of stephen east with evercore isi your line is open stephen f east  evercore isi thank you thank you good morning guys thanks for the detail on plumbing in europe i guess if you could talk a little bit more about what you all are doing with the emerging markets in europe just trying to understand where youre going with the business and what percentage of europe is plumbing for you all keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director we have a as you know stephen a very strong global brand in hansgrohe and our plan for that brand is to continue to invest in it and we have a substantial amount of upside as we look across the emerging markets both in europe and outside of europe so in general our expectation is to continue to invest behind that we see good returns on that the business has good margins and we feel really good about emerging markets you mentioned europe in particular of course we continue to have challenges like everyone does in the ukraine and in russia but were committed to the european market and we like the results that were seeing and well have more detailed information at the investor day as we outline more specific growth plans and milestones john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp stephen maybe just to give you a little bit of color international sales represent approximately  of the segment sales stephen f east  evercore isi okay okay and within – embedded within that i know you gave us the top line fx impact the op margin impact would you mind giving and then my second question revolved around behr it was a fairly easy comp so im wondering did the lowes paint rollout sort of disrupt the market what do you think is going on there and then are you starting to see any raw material tailwind from oil costs coming down and the derivative products off that john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp so stephen just to answer your first question the operating profit impact of foreign currency was approximately  million in the plumbing segment in the quarter stephen f east  evercore isi okay john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp coincidentally that happens also to be the impact for the company in total stephen f east  evercore isi okay thanks john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp as it relates to paint keith do you want keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director yeah on the paint side as we mentioned in our remarks we have good strong momentum rolling with a lot of our awards rolling our way and were investing behind that we have a new color center that were launching and that will be rolled out in the end of march we really feel good about that we have an advertising campaign thats coming in consistent with that and weve also got new products that were rolling out where weve rebranded kilz prox to behrpro and i think thats going to be very productive for us were rolling out textured deckover when you put that all together we feel confident in where paints going operator your next question comes from the line of tim wojs with baird your line is open tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker hey good morning everybody nice job keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director thanks tim tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker i guess i just had a couple of questions on the ebit i was wondering if you could – i think in the past youve given us an ebit bridge yearoveryear im just wondering if maybe i missed that but if you could kind of go through what the price commodity was productivity those types of things john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp yeah tim were not giving out that information any longer so – but suffice to say if you think about the volumes – we had pretty good volume growth in the quarter obviously offset by a fair amount of currency headwinds and a little bit of pricing in there as well so i think ive got – i thought some of the segment detail that i provided was probably more useful than giving it in the company overall so take a look at the transcript and then if you have more questions we can perhaps circle back after the call tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker okay no i just wanted to make sure i didnt miss it and then i guess just as you guys stand right now i know its early but any change to how youre thinking about the full year with one quarter under your belt and then just a housekeeping question how should we think of the fx headwind to revenue for the full year keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director no change in our outlook for the year were excited about it and we continue to be positive about how we see  shaping up when you look at the fundamentals and the indicators from a macroeconomic standpoint theyre shaping up well consumer confidence is good household formation seemed to have spiked existing home sales are wellpositioned and credits easing up so from a macro perspective we continue to be very positive when you look specifically at the demand drivers in terms of new construction we talked last call about how we felt that blue chip was maybe a little aggressive at  million theyve since come down we think theyre still a little bit high were looking at about  million is how were thinking out at it in terms of starts so thats a good healthy  growth for us and were seeing indications of that growth importantly in the markets carolinas very robust florida is robust dallas is doing well so this is fairly typical of what we see where pockets start to have that kind of heat so on the new construction side we feel good about it on the rr demand drivers when you look at in addition to the macroeconomic indicators you look at how our businesses that are more skewed to rr are performing you see good signs plumbing is a strong rr business for us and thats doing very well milgard windows is principally an rr play and thats doing extremely well and in cabinets were seeing kraftmaid which is in the high end more or less in that space doing well and starting to grow which is indicative of a move towards that bigger ticket our channel partners as they announced a month or so ago had very strong comps so from a macroeconomic standpoint a new construction demand driver an rr demand driver we feel very good about the year and continue to be positive and i think importantly we have the supply chain in our company set up to handle it without a significant capital expense and the inefficiencies that can sometimes come with that so were positive for the year john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp tim as it relates to your housekeeping question on fx fx will continue to be a headwind particularly for the second and third quarters because of the way that currency developed last year if you think about in the fourth quarter we had about a  million headwind in currency in the fourth quarter of last year so the comp will ease as we get into the backhalf of the year particularly the fourth quarter so if you take a look at where currency rates are today versus where they were over the last year order of magnitude of  million so headwind facing us from currency this year tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker great appreciate the color thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike dahl with credit suisse please go ahead michael g dahl  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi thank you i wanted to go back to the plumbing discussion and actually focus on the margins i think you had said you expect full year margins in the  to  range clearly a lot of the headwinds in the first quarter but also seems to imply that any benefits that youre getting on the commodity side are likely to be offset by maybe currency and some of the spend in the near term just wondering how youd think about that and going forward is this – i think youve talked about margins that could be a little bit higher in a normal environment than this so is there any change there or is this just more of a temporary issue keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director mike there is no change to our mid to long term expectations for margin in the segment midteens and specifically in the quarter we incurred about  million of expense related to advertising marketing and trade show expense which happens every other year at ish we believe this is really good spend for us to make this is a productive segment for us we have strong brands with good growth potential so this is a good place to put our investment and for those of you that were at the ish show in frankfurt you were able to see the power of the hansgrohe brand i dont think its saying too much to say that we were most definitely the best position in the entire fair and thats a fair that happens europeanwide every other year so we feel really good about the investment in it and we really dont see a change to our margin expectations in this space michael g dahl  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay great and then shifting gears to the cabinet side just with the leadership change or the new leadership coming in can you talk about just what some of the specific initiatives that bills been tasked with are – as far as kind of day one first few months and then longer term whats he you really coming in to do differently than you guys had been doing keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director joe gross is the right leader for this business at this time we brought him in because of his experience and he is steeped in turnarounds hes spent a good portion of his career in private equity working for cerberus and hes run and turned around and helped us in significant businesses here in our portfolio in terms of the specific initiatives and his plan of attack and what were doing with this business weve talked about our objective is to drive this business to profitability in  and were going to do that and in terms of specifics well talk about that next week and youll get a chance to meet joe michael g dahl  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of robert wetenhall with rbc capital markets your line is open matt a bouley  rbc capital markets llc hi this is actually matt bouley on for bob thanks for taking my questions so just in paint on the raw materials side im wondering if you can update us on what youre seeing now in terms of the paint feedstocks and what youre expecting in  keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director we really have seen modest deflation in paint so far we expect to see a little bit of favorability on the paint side coming in in the next quarter how long thats going to last remains to be seen if you look at expanding it to our entire commodity basket there really is a mixed bag were seeing copper in our plumbing segment come off its lows again how long and how high copper pricing will go remains to be seen were seeing some slight inflation in hardwoods in our cabinets side and of course a month or so ago there was an announcement of a  price increase in our installation we are seeing a little bit of favorability out in logistics – in terms of logistics costs as the price of diesel starts to come down as we talked earlier we really see no significant change in our margin expectations particularly in our big segments around paint and plumbing matt a bouley  rbc capital markets llc got it thanks and then back to cabinets just given the recent consolidation in the space so im wondering if you could touch on maybe the competitive dynamics youre seeing and particularly in the dealer channel keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director we really dont see a big change in terms of the competitive environment weve competed against norcraft for years and were going to continue to do that we have strong competitors out in the space we respect them for sure were focused on our business and joe and the team driving the turnaround and getting our cabinet business back to profitability but dont see any real fundamental changes in the competitive environment matt a bouley  rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of eric bosshard with cleveland research please go ahead eric bosshard  cleveland research co llc thank you two questions first of all in the paint segment the margin performance obviously quite good but from a revenue perspective it sounds like the hardware and the paint both showed growth im curious in how you think that growth compares to the markets in the first quarter and how we should expect that growth to behave as we move through the year john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp yeah eric its john yeah if you look at some of the others that have reported were consistent with some the one companys a little bit higher than us but they had a loadin going in in the stores so we think if anything we are holding if not picking up just a little bit of share in the marketplace today eric bosshard  cleveland research co llc okay and then a similar question on the cabinets side you know the cabinet growth is i think a little bit better than prior trend as you look forward in that business and you can get a little bit of a forward look with measurements in traffic in that segment but curious what youre seeing and expecting in terms of the revenue growth opportunity there and also the market share opportunity there how that experience is playing out keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director were seeing some good traction particularly in our kraftmaid brand at both retail and the dealer segment market share is very difficult in this fragmented market to report particularly when youre talking about a quarteroverquarter of variance but we like our demand trend and we think were winning with kraftmaid both in retail and in dealer we remain challenged in the dealer segment for merillat as we recover from some of our execution issues that we had last year frankly we have our deliveries and lead times back and were starting to win back that the trust of that segment we have the leading brands in kraftmaid and merillat in the rr and the builder segment respectively so were going to continue to drive that demand eric bosshard  cleveland research co llc just within that again the underlying demand i appreciate the progress on market share the underlying cabinet demand especially on the rr side how is that behaving relative to your expectations and how do you think about that specific category this year rr cabinets keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director i think its robust i mean when you look at the pentup demand that weve seen over lack of spend in prior years when we look at the indicators in terms of new home values we look at store traffic the fact that kraftmaid for us has momentum and thats on a higher end of the price continuum i think that bodes well for the overall rr dynamics eric bosshard  cleveland research co llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike wood with macquarie capital your line is open mike wood  macquarie capital usa inc hi good morning and thanks for taking my question first question in cabinets im curious if you can gives us how much erp inefficiencies where in the cabinet segment in the first quarter and some of your competitors have gone through the portfolio and exited recently some unprofitable markets in cabinets regional builder share have you gone through that your portfolio and made that decision yet as to whether or not you can exit certain underperforming businesses john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp yes hi mike as it relates to the erp inefficiencies we experienced it was about  million in the first quarter keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director in terms of the strategy of the team thats in place and the leadership of joe we are definitely applying segmentation to customers markets geographies and channels and were looking at that as a factor without question and again at the investor day next week were going to go into more detail on that mike wood  macquarie capital usa inc great and was the – in paint was the deferral of that spending just more of an execution timing and if you could also just comment on the pro initiatives it was mentioned in the release just wondering how large that business is keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director yeah so mike the deferral – it was more due to the fact that we had some inclement weather so we thought wed ask the advertisement people in painting so we just deferred it into second and third quarters as it relates to the pro business they continue to have nice growth and well talk more – jeff filley the head of behr will talk more about our pro initiatives next week at the investor day mike wood  macquarie capital usa inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of philip ng with jefferies your line is open philip ng  jefferies llc good morning top line in your cabinets were pretty strong have you been able to regain some of that lost year in home center the home center channel and the highsingle digit growth in kraftmaid is better than we would have expected how does that stack up to your expectation and did you have to cede some price to regain market share keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director it met our expectation we planned on as we talked last call of recalibrating our pricing and promotional strategies were leveraging the brand and the designer advocacy that we have in kraftmaid so philip id say it was on plan and we do think that the growth that we showed was a share gain for us philip ng  jefferies llc okay thats helpful and can you give us a little color on how – it sounds like youre generally upbeat about the outlook but can you give us some color on how the start of the spring selling season is progressing and any sales trends youve seen in april keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director yeah we like what were seeing the demand is rolling along as expected as i talked in some of the earlier remarks the macroeconomics and what were seeing in specific markets the foot traffic were seeing in retail the movement with kraftmaid indicating that the buyer is moving up in terms of the price continuum that all supports a nice spring selling season philip ng  jefferies llc okay all right thanks guys good luck in the quarter operator your next question comes from the line of alex rygiel with fbr your line is open alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co thank you good morning gentlemen looking at the plumbing margins that expectation of  to  this year is there any way you could sort of quantify the negative headwinds this year from emerging markets trade show expense and foreign currency john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp sure alex well that impact comes over a period of time weve introduced a lot of new products at those trade shows and particularly the one in frankfurt and so we will see the benefit of those sales really from in  and  because a lot those wont hit the market until later this year but when they do because theyre new products and they – weve priced them approximately because of the innovation thats in these new products you will see that the margin benefit at that time alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co and then secondly can you go a little bit deeper on the doubledigit growth in windows in the quarter was that market share growth price or market share gains john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp it was probably a little bit of share gain along with some improved mix in the quarter weve seen a lot of nice upward pricing – or price point driven demand from the consumers in the western us so think of our essence windows as we talked about or keith mentioned it a couple of minutes ago some of our paint and vinyl products are doing particularly well the sliding glass doorglass wall product that we came out with last year are all resonating very well with the consumers in the western us alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of dennis mcgill with zelman  associates please go ahead dennis p mcgill  zelman  associates hi good morning thank you guys just wanted to go back to decorative architectural segment john are you seeing or did you guys see any difference between point of sale and your revenue recognition during the quarter john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp we did – yeah pos was higher than our revenue recognition dennis p mcgill  zelman  associates and what was driving that john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp i think there may have been just a small amount of inventory balancing there dennis dennis p mcgill  zelman  associates and is that across the hardware and paint segment or more paint john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp id say its solely in the paint segment dennis p mcgill  zelman  associates okay and then just going back to cabinets you touched on this a little bit i think around the merillat performance but can you speak to maybe a little bit more specifically the trends youre seeing in the home center versus merillat in the dealer channel how much of a drag is that for you guys right now that youre looking to reverse keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director were performing well in the home center dealer channel with kraftmaid the challenge that were facing to give you a little bit of color on that from the merillat side as you know last year we had delivery and lead time issues associated with some execution problems we had with our erp system weve put that in the rearview mirror we have our delivery and our lead times back but there has been some hangover with regards to our ability to serve in businesses that those dealers go after were building that confidence back we havent lost leaderships but we did lose some confidence in them and were working that back and stepbystep well continue to do that so directly to your question dennis were seeing some good strong retail and dealer business in kraftmaid we continue to be challenged with regards to the demand side at merillat but were getting better dennis p mcgill  zelman  associates and im sure youll touch on this next week but as far as communicating that message to the merillat dealers whats the primary focus that youre communicating to them right now as far as why they should stick with you keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director well really its not so much the communication isnt oriented on why to stick with us its why you should grow with us and why were going to be dependable and fundamentally we do that with our numbers and our performance dennis p mcgill  zelman  associates okay i look forward to next week thanks guys john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp thanks dennis operator your next question comes from the line of michael rehaut with jpmorgan your line is open michael jason rehaut  jpmorgan securities llc thanks good morning everyone first question i had was on – just going back to plumbing for a moment the  margin in the quarter you mentioned obviously impacted by the trade show and some of the spend and i believe you said last quarter the trade show itself was  million so i just wanted to make sure that was the case but getting to the  to  margin for the full year from the  youre seeing in the first quarter is that a function of most of that  million dissipating or is there sort of incremental profitability that you expect as well from volume growth or price mix if you could go into a little more detail in terms of going from the  to the  to  for the year john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp sure mike its john so the trade show actually costs us  million so a little bit more than we expected than the  million but in the  million theres some embedded incremental advertising and marketing expenses that we referred to so thats how you bridge the  million to the  million in terms of the growth – the profit growth going forward from q to q clearly a big part of it is just the expense that we incurred in q we dont expect to repeat itself in the following quarters at the same time we do expect to grow this business so the balance of that relates to the volume drop that we expect to have in the remaining three quarters in  in terms of mix we do probably see a little bit of improved mix over the quarter but we did have kind of some crosswinds in there in the first quarter just with the strong growth in the emerging markets that we experienced michael jason rehaut  jpmorgan securities llc great no thank you and just a second question on cabinets you had a  million profit improvement off of  million in better volume or im sorry better revenue so it would seem that a portion of the profit improvement was just from incremental margins and i was hoping you could explain the other portion if that was maybe lapping some erp or costs that youre not incurring this year if you could kind of walk through the drivers of the profit improvement and in terms of the new management i was hoping just to get a sense for – you kind of referred to the fact that the new leader and i apologize for not catching the name i believe bill sic joe gross not coming from private equity place but if theres also – if could just go through his background in a little more detail as well as if there were any other major changes to the leadership team i think weve discussed in the past keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director yeah weve – the improvement is a combination of some favorable mix that weve seen and kraftmaid growing we certainly are performing better on the operational side and getting over some of the inefficiencies of erp weve also taken some costs out so its a combination of the usual suspects with regards to the improvements with regard to joe gross hes not a bond guy hes joe and not bill hes been with masco for quite a number of years he came from our tool business and then was moved into a president of our rough plumbing business and all along the way hes done a tremendous job he does have significant turnaround experience as i mentioned hes worked in private equity for a good portion of his career so he brings a very good perspective in this business and as i said youll get a chance to meet him to talk to him to have qa et cetera at the investor conference michael jason rehaut  jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of george staphos with bank of america your line is open george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch hi everyone good morning most of my questions have been asked but ill give it a shot with these two first of all can you comment at all or affirm what your views on the incremental margin and incremental profit uplift should be for cabinets this year i seem to recall there was a  million or so builtin benefit given last years inefficiencies and then keith i remember still a goal of  incremental margin can you confirm that thats the outlook for  and then question for you john just on fx can you comment at all on sort of how your debt is allocated regionally i dont recall on whether theres an opportunity at all to use that as a natural hedge for fx going forward john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp so george with respect to your incremental margin question on cabinetry yeah we do expect that there should be a  million tailwind from just the lack of the incremental expenses that we incurred in  that will benefit  so above and beyond that in terms of just the volume benefit we should expect about a  dropdown on a contribution margin on incremental volume in the segment so thats how to kind of think about profit growth in  and beyond in our cabinet business as it relates to fx right now all of our debt is usbased but to your point given the attractive rate environment that were seeing over in europe as we have upcoming maturities and we have that significant maturity thats coming up in  if the rate environment stays similar to what it is now we would definitely consider taking a look at perhaps doing some eurobased financing for that refinancing activity later next year george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch okay keith just one quickie and not trying to be too shortterm in answering a prior question you were certainly espousing your optimism your confidence in the way the quarter is developing is there a way to put a number or a range on the sales comp youre seeing thus far in the quarter thanks and good luck in the quarter keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think were – im going to stay away from giving a number our outlook has not changed we feel the same way about these businesses now as we did coming into the quarter and continue to feel good about the outlook for  george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch thank you operator your next question comes from the line of susan maklari with ubs your line is open susan marie maklari  ubs securities llc good morning keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director good morning susan susan marie maklari  ubs securities llc in terms of the pricing environment and promotions i know that you made a big effort towards the end of last year to sort of reset a lot of that can you talk about with the improvement that you saw during the quarter any changes there and maybe any abilities to sort of get more pricing as we go through the year keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director as we talked about – as i talked about last quarter our intention was to adjust our promotional strategy and pricing in cabinets we got more aggressive than i think the market would bear as weve talked about in the past and we made some adjustments to that were competitive in terms of where we are in our strategy right now and we saw good results from it were committed to driving this business to profitability and were seeing some nice signs as joe and the new team start to get traction susan marie maklari  ubs securities llc okay and then in terms of your working capital the improvement was really impressive there as you saw things take off in the quarter can you talk a little bit about how we can expect to trend during the year and is there may be anything significant that you can do there john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp we continue to work on working capital susan and as you highlighted just great outcome that the team from an operations finance and supply chain execute upon we do incentivize all of our employees across the enterprise on working capital performance so there is incentive to continue to improve that so theres a variety of things that were working on principally around inventories we think theres an opportunity to continue to improve that said i think given that were kind of at record low levels of working capital the improvement from here will be slightly incremental dont expect major stepchange improvement from working capital going forward susan marie maklari  ubs securities llc okay thats great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of nishu sood with deutsche bank please go ahead nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc thanks so keith when your tenure started and you talked about portfolio restructuring most of the investor focus was on what might be divested but you folks are fairly consistent in talking about potential bolton acquisitions happening as well so the endless pools acquisition first if you could give us some sense of the size of that sales maybe ebitda and also if you could give us some sense of how it fits in to the acquisition vision and what it might tell us about what sorts of future acquisitions youre considering and might make as time goes on keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director endless pools was a small acquisition for us it was about  million in terms of how it fits into the overall strategy were focused on boltons rather than per se another leg another platform for us we view plumbing and paint north american and global and that space is where our target is were targeting in the range of  million to  million as the kind of acquisitions that were looking on so endless pools is small but its consistent in that its in plumbing its where we see the potential to leverage either our technologies or our access to markets and thats what weve brought onboard a new vp of strategy and business development and his role is to help manage our pipeline and were working with our teams to do that so while its small its quite consistent with what were looking at in terms of our ongoing acquisitions nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc got it and you mean up to  million to  million in the acquisition value keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director correct nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc got it okay and a second question the investor day obviously everyone is looking forward to that youve mentioned well be hearing from a few of the divisions cabinets probuilt paint are we going to be hearing from all of the different divisions is it going to be a pretty systematic review of whats going on across masco what – maybe – are there going to be some themes youre going to be looking at obviously im sure well get all the details but maybe if you could give us a movie trailer version keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director youre not going to hear from every one of our general managers but clearly youre going to have people talking to you about every segment were going to go through and put the business leaders in front to talk about their growth strategies were going to talk about specific actions as well as performance milestones and were going to talk about expectations nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc got it okay great well see you next week thanks keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of will randow with citi your line is open will randow  citigroup global markets inc broker hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions i was curious on the cabinet side it looks like you guys introduced the merillat express five day ship business along with recently purchased the cardell trademark and have been making some waves in cabinets wheres the strategic vision behind some of those initiatives keith j allman  president chief executive officer  director well cardell was purchased some time ago and really what were focused on is trying to give our customers what they need to drive foot traffic and to be profitable for them and for us to be profitable so our strategy is a combination of market penetration with the strongest brands that we have as well as getting our house in order with regards to performance and cost will randow  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks for that and just one followup in terms of the pace of the repurchase program with about  million shares in the first quarter is there any room to accelerate that and are you looking at this consistently on a free cash flow less share purchases neutral basis thank you john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp yeah will there is always opportunity to accelerate or decelerate this share repurchase activity based on where we see the share price go as i mentioned in my remarks we are – we did reaffirm the fact that we would purchase between  million and  million worth of shares this year and so well continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate repurchases based on where the share price is at will randow  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks again operator your next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust your line is open keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey thank you my questions on cabinets you had discussed mix being a positive in the quarter could you give us a view of where volume was in the first quarter john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp yeah so volume was up just a little bit keith pretty good volume in that we saw as a result of the mix though so kraftmaid really led the volume charge in q as keith mentioned earlier both at retail as well as our dealers so that initiative has gone very well so were very pleased with the volume growth at kraftmaid keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey does that mean that merillat volume was down yearoveryear john g sznewajs  chief financial officer treasurer  vp yeah it was down slightly yearoveryear keith hughes  suntrust robinson
