journalread more  services such as uber and lyft could help companies especially those near public transportation and downtowns brokers say new jersey office landlords have been sprucing up their properties with everything from food trucks to fitness centers to compete in an era when urban amenities are in vogue the latest enticement subsidies for digital ridehailing services such as uber and lyft hugo neu corp in march launched a program offering  monthly credits for each tenant employee without a car to commute to kearny point an ongoing project to redevelop historic shipyard buildings into office and lightindustrial space in kearny nj the realestate investment firm marcus partners meanwhile is offering new tenants a ridesharing program that pays the first  of a trip to or from its newly acquired office building just outside morristown’s center in new jersey “morristown is a wonderful town not only because you have a train station but also because you have restaurants and nightlife” said david p fiore a principal at marcus partners and head of the company’s new york metro region “we thought the flexibility of a ridesharing program allows tenants and employees a strong connection to downtown” while residential landlords nationwide have been testing similar programs such incentives from office owners are relatively rare services such as uber and lyft could help new jersey office landlords especially those in areas that are a few minutes’ drive to public transportation and vibrant downtowns realestate brokers said subsidizing ridehailing services also could help landlords attract tenants looking to pack more people into less office space particularly in areas where parking is tight brokers said “the trend is companies putting more people in less space for efficiency and cost effectiveness” said david simson a vice chairman at realestate services firm newmark grubb knight frank “when you are in the suburbs you run against the wall that is parking” older office buildings were built with three to four parking spaces per  square feet of office space but modern office spaces require upward of five spots per  square feet according to a newmark report adding parking decks can cost between  and  per space the report said parking constraints for train commuters prompted summit city officials last fall to launch a pilot program subsidizing city residents’ rides to and from the train station the participants pay  a day round trip and the city subsidizes the rest so far the program a possible alternative to expensive new parking has freed up  to  parking spaces a day said michael rogers summit’s city administrator the city has increased the number of participants in its program from  to  people adequate parking however hasn’t been the issue for the property at kearny point’s building  which houses many small businesses from tech firms to artisanal food makers and offers a coworking space hugo neu which owns and develops real estate added the uber credits to provide another transportation option and has found that its coworking tenants many of whom don’t have cars have been using about half of the credits said nick shears director of leasing at hugo neu the uber subsidy is what allowed alak vasa founder of chocolate maker elements truffles to add three people to her team at kearny point and keep a critical employee who had been with the company in its first space in jersey city “we have people who live in jersey city who we have already invested in” ms vasa said “how do we get them here” marcus partners is hoping the incentive will provide a seamless connection to downtown morristown which is nearly  miles away the rideshare program which isn’t yet in use is one more amenity the company hopes will draw tenants to the  square feet of space available at the morristown building which its brokers said offers less expensive rents than those downtown marcus also is investing about  million in improvements that include a new glass facade better lighting and terraces “the divide we have to get across is being in a downtown location” said bill brown executive director at realestate services firm cushman  wakefield and part of the team marketing the building “and the way we’re trying to bridge the gap is with a ride sharing service” article by keiko morris  wall street journal june  marcus partners

team that has worked together for an average of  years and have an average of  years of real estate industry experience july  parking becoming key part of deals office space shrinking but not need for spotsread more  when it came time to market  sylvan way to tenants last year normandy real estate partners made sure to leave no stone unturned that meant completing the base building design and securing the local approvals needed to gut and rebuild the squarefoot office property in parsippany but the firm saw one other issue it had to tackle the yearold building would need more parking to accommodate the type of highend highdensity corporate user it was seeking “that was something that came a little bit later in the design as we started talking to tenants and recognized that this is something that is going to be an important problem to solve to make sure we check every box” said paul teti principal and head of leasing for normandy the developer did just that by building a new singlestory parking deck and redesigning the surface lot at  sylvan upgrades that increased the parking capacity from  to  spaces they also were also a key selling point for zoetis the onetime pfizer animal health spinoff which has leased the full building as its headquarters and will move in around labor day “i can say without question that adding that parking was an absolutely critical component in order to get this specific tenant and i think any tenant of this size into the project” teti said “in the s the space utilization was just completely different and the site was planned for that kind of parking so being able to solve for the parking with the singlestory deck made all the difference in the world and allowed us to capture the tenant for sure” landlords and developers in new jersey are taking a likeminded approach as corporate tenants pack more employees into smaller spaces — in an effort to save on real estate costs — the parking capacity at many suburban office buildings is no longer enough building owners are responding by adding to that capacity a move that helps them stand out in a market with a glut of highwaycentric office space “it certainly is a competitive advantage but i actually think it’s more of a necessity” said david fiore principal and new york area market director for marcus partners the bostonbased real estate investment firm owns  plaza drive in secaucus where it recently built a new car parking deck and last month inked a squarefoot lease with quest diagnostics building a parking structure is not quite so simple given the costs and the need to secure approvals from the local government experts say building costs can range from  to  per space meaning even smaller projects can amount to millions of dollars fiore said the structure at  plaza drive along with the renovation of an existing space garage accounted for about a third of roughly  million in capital improvements launched by the firm after it acquired the building in  but it was a worthwhile investment to attract a tenant such as quest and the roughly  employees that will move in by next year “it was always part of the program” fiore said “a central part of our acquisition of the property was to have the ability to increase the parking density because we knew that any major users out there that we were trying to attract would come to us and say ‘we need more parking than the standard building’ ” tim greiner a broker and executive managing director with newmark grubb knight frank said those costs are typically passed onto tenants but noted that those companies are likely saving on rent in the long run because they’re taking significantly less space he said there are other tenants in the market that are seeking smaller footprints and will likely push landlords to readapt their parking options it’s one reason why lincoln equities group which greiner’s firm represents presented the option of building a new parking structure earlier this year as it marketed the vacant squarefoot former pfizer building at  giralda farms in madison as for obtaining local approvals he said governing bodies have long sought to minimize parking garages on properties in their towns but with the state’s abundance of empty office buildings those municipalities that wish to compete for major corporations “have changed their tune and are working with those owners and developers” “a lot of towns historically have said ‘i don’t want a big parking deck on my lot — it’s ugly it doesn’t do anything it’s just not a pretty sight in the middle of suburban office parks to have these giant decks everywhere’ ” greiner said “but those towns that are letting developers do that will win more deals going forward because it’s definitely a trend that’s happening” teti expects the ability to add parking to be increasingly important in vying for suburban deals but not simply because companies have consolidated their footprints across the board corporate tenants such as zoetis “may not be solving for that parking issue every day” he said but have to allow for ebb and flow in their headcount for those times when workfromhome or outofmarket employees need to show up at the office “some of these companies have town hall meetings and things like that where they’ve got days where their population swells and that’s where the additional parking need often times comes in” teti said “so it’s not necessarily going to be utilized every day but it’s a critical component of their plan going forward” new deck designfor landlords who are building new parking structures to compete for tenants the columnfilled concrete boxes of the past are no longer an option“any new structure that we build we build columnfree so that you don’t have to worry about backing out and losing your mirror to a column” said david fiore principal and new york area market director for marcus partners which owns  plaza drive in secaucus “so we make the parking decks as comfortable and easy to use as possible “and of course people are always concerned about security so we typically have things like gates and cameras to monitor the garages good lighting is also very important”  article by joshua burd at njbizcom june  quest diagnostics to relocate headquarters to  plaza drive in secaucus njread more  norwalk ct  marcus partners a valueoriented real
