products or technologies that are complementary to our current or future business and product lines we are not currently negotiating any acquisitions and we have no agreements with any third party for any acquisition pending use of the net proceeds of this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in interestbearing investmentgrade securities the competitive environment in the san market is still developing we anticipate that the market for our products will be highly competitive continually evolving and subject to rapid technological change new san products are being introduced by various server and storage providers and existing products will be continually enhanced we face competition primarily from other manufacturers of san hub and switch products including emulex corporation and vixel corporation in the san hub market and ancor communications inc brocade communications systems inc and vixel corporation in the san switch market furthermore although we currently offer products that are complementary to san software products offered by companies such as legato systems inc and veritas software corporation they and other enterprise software developers may in the future compete with us we also compete with providers of data storage solutions that employ traditional technologies including scsibased technology such as adaptec inc lsi logic corporation and qlogic corporation in addition as the market for san products grows we may face competition from traditional networking companies and other manufacturers of networking equipment these networking companies may enter the san market by introducing their own products acquiring an existing san infrastructure provider or by entering into an alliance with an existing san provider it is also possible that original equipment manufacturer customers could develop and introduce products competitive with our product offerings we believe the competitive factors in the san market include the following  product performance and features  product reliability and interoperability  price  strength of distribution channel  ability to meet delivery schedules and  customer service and technical support some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories significantly greater resources and name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have as a result these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours which would allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements in addition some of our current and potential competitors have already established supplier or joint development relationships with divisions of our current or potential customers these competitors may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage these customers from purchasing additional products from us or persuade them to replace our products with their products increased competition could result in pricing pressures reduced sales reduced margins reduced profits reduced market share or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance we may not have the financial resources technical expertise or marketing manufacturing distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future additionally we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and competitive pressures may materially harm our business company description overview we are a leading provider of hardware and software products that enable the creation of networks made up of computers and data storage devices which have become known as storage area networks or sans we helped pioneer the development of sans by taking the concepts used to connect computers to one another in local area networks and applying those same concepts to the connection of computers and data storage devices our san products are based on fibre channel technology a set of specifications designed to enable computing devices to exchange large amounts of data we have designed our products to leverage the capabilities of fibre channel technology to enable companies to better manage the growth of missioncritical data by overcoming the limitations of the traditional captive storage architecture and creating a foundation for data centralization we believe that we have developed the most comprehensive line of products in the san industry these products include  the bitstrip active hub a gigabit fibre channel hub which provides a costeffective solution for entrylevel sans  the gibraltar line of hubs a managed hub designed to provide centralized management of a san  the denali area switch a fibre channel switch to support data backup without a server  the capellix chassis switch a switch that can be configured to perform multiple functions by adding hardware and  the ventana san manager a san management software application which provides monitoring and control of san devices we began commercial shipments of our san products in october  our primary customers include original equipment manufacturer customers and distribution channel partners our original equipment manufacturer customers include hewlettpackard company compaq computer corporation data general corporation and avid technology inc additionally we have developed a twotier distribution channel comprised of distributors and resellers including andataco inc bell microproducts inc decision support systems inc merisel inc rorke data inc and tokyo electron limited according to international data corporation january  our installed base of fibre channel networking ports represents the largest share of the total hub and switch ports shipped in the two years ended december   we believe we have the largest installed base of san networking ports we believe that the san infrastructure created by our network products forms the foundation for a new data management architecture just as the infrastructure created by local area networks or lans formed a platform for the development of clientserver computing we believe that the san infrastructure has the potential to enable the development of a distributed data management architecture we plan to leverage our technological expertise our market leadership and the strength of our partnerships to drive the development of this architecture and create new opportunities for our business industry background growth of enterprise data the volume of data generated in todays business environment continues to grow at a significant rate international data corporation september  estimates that multiuser disk storage grew from approximately  terabytes in  to approximately  terabytes in  and will reach approximately  terabytes in  this growth in the volume of enterprise data has been fueled by a number of factors including  the emergence and rapid growth of dataintensive applications such as ecommerce online transaction processing webserving digital video and other multimedia applications and enterprise resource planning  the increasing importance of digital information as a strategic business asset  the need for redundant depositories of data to enable continuous access  advances in storage technology and the resulting decline in the cost of storage capacity and  a trend toward distributing data in the enterprise clientserver environment traditional captive storage architecture the growth of the amount of enterprise data has resulted in a corresponding need to manage share backup and make data widely accessible this need has traditionally been addressed by connecting individual highperformance computers known as servers to dedicated storage devices this approach results in a captive storage architecture where storage devices are connected to only one server and not to any of the other servers utilized by an enterprise these connections are made through the use of the small computer system interface or scsi technology graphic graphical representation of the traditional storage architecture the traditional captive storage architecture has several significant limitations including  capacity constraints small computer system interface technology cannot typically support more than  individual disk drives in general to add additional storage capacity additional servers must be added which is costly and inefficient  performance constraints the bandwidth or rate at which data can be transmitted of commerciallyavailable small computer system interface technology is fixed at  or  megabytes per second accordingly the addition of a new storage device may not result in a proportional increase in performance because the available bandwidth may be fully utilized by the amount of data already flowing between the server and the existing storage devices further the addition of new storage devices may actually degrade performance as more devices compete to utilize available bandwidth  lack of management small computer system interface technology does not have any inherent capability to manage connections storage or data as a result servers are burdened with management tasks this is cumbersome because there is no centralized monitoring and control this is also inefficient because server bandwidth is spent managing data and not serving clients generating a need for more servers because of this lack of centralized management we believe the cost of managing storage exceeds the cost of the storage devices themselves  lack of availability and disaster tolerance in general a small computer system interfaceconnected device can only be accessed by its dedicated server if the server becomes unavailable for any reason such as a breakdown of the server or a disaster affecting the entire data center data on its connected storage devices becomes inaccessible this lack of fault and disaster tolerance makes the enterprise vulnerable to server or data center failures because the small computer systems interface standard typically limits the distance between servers and storage devices to  meters redundant storage devices in remote locations are generally not practical or costeffective as a result sustained data availability in a captive storage architecture following a system failure or disaster is difficult to achieve development of fibre channel in  the american national standards institute approved the fibre channel standard as an open standard technology specifically for high performance inputoutput intensive environments such as serverstorage connectivity commercially available fibre channel products offer over  gigabit per second of bandwidth multiple fibre channel links of up to  kilometers each may be interconnected to enable long distances between servers and storage devices fibre channel technology also enables hundreds of storage devices and servers to be interconnected the need for a new storage architecture despite the greater bandwidth and capacity offered by fibre channel fibre channel alone does not address the data management data availability and disaster tolerance issues resulting from the growth of enterprise data a new storage architecture comprised of a new model for connecting storage devices with servers and a foundation for distributing data management applications is needed the gadzoox solution we sell hardware and software products that create storage area networks or sans for the intelligent management of enterprise data to address limitations of the traditional captive storage architecture we pioneered the development of the san by leveraging the capabilities of fibre channel to create a new network architecture that is designed to enable multiple storage devices to be connected to multiple servers we believe the combination of our technical innovation and our market vision has influenced and will continue to impact the evolution of the san market according to international data corporation january  our installed base of fibre channel networking ports represents the largest share of the total hub and switch ports shipped in the two years ended december   we believe we have the largest installed base of san networking ports we developed some of the first storage area network devices and introduced products that are designed to manage data from within a san without relying on servers our products include an active hub a hub with intelligent diagnostics an area switch and a chassis switch for sans utilizing the proven principles of centralized network management for local area networks we were also the first to deliver managed network devices and management software for sans these devices are designed to centralize the monitoring diagnosis and control of a storage area network our storage area network solution is based on the following topology graphic graphical representation of the topology of the san our storage connectivity products address the limitations of traditional captive storage architectures in the following ways capacity scalability our hub switch and san management products are designed to allow users to scale servers and storage capacity independently to meet their individual needs for example our proprietary perfectport feature is designed to enable the reliable linking of multiple hubs and switches to scale storage capacity as a result our products help users realize fibre channels ability to connect hundreds of storage devices or subsystems to multiple servers this is more costeffective than the traditional captive storage architecture which requires businesses to purchase one or more servers to facilitate the addition of storage devices increased performance our products are designed to provide access to data at speeds exceeding  gigabit per second in addition our capellix switch has greater port capacity and a faster switching backplane than the port and port san switches currently available in the market this enables higher performance and more cost effective scaling because more devices can be connected through a single capellix switch with higher available bandwidth than can be connected through existing switches our products leverage the multiple servermultiple storage device topology of sans to allow multiple users simultaneous access to stored data over independent paths within the san this permits faster access to data by more users than is possible in a traditional captive storage architecture manageability our management products are designed to provide centralized monitoring and control of storage and networking devices in a distributed san environment for example our proprietary management features and ventana san manager software are designed to minimize downtime by monitoring detecting isolating and troubleshooting faults as they occur our products leverage the san environment to facilitate the sharing of storage resources such as tape backup devices and disk arrays or disk drives grouped together to provide added storage capacity our products also leverage the san environment to reduce the total cost of ownership of storage networks we believe that centralized management results in a total cost of ownership model where the cost of data management is significantly less than the cost of the storage devices themselves data availability and disaster tolerance our products are designed to further enhance sans by allowing network administrators to specify primary and secondary data transmission pathways known as failover links sans are substantially more fault tolerant than the traditional captive storage architecture because access to storage devices on a san is independent of any single server as a result even if one or more servers fail data stored on san storage devices is still accessible by other servers connected to the san in addition because fibre channel allows devices to be located farther apart physically than small computer system interface technology storage devices on the same san can be placed in remote locations to increase disaster tolerance our products offer the following additional benefits and features interoperability our products leverage the fibre channel arbitrated loop protocol this protocol is the most widelydeployed fibre channel standard as a result we believe our products are compatible with substantially all major fibre channel servers and storage subsystems this interoperability allows customers to install our products into their existing small computer system interface technology which allows them to better preserve their investment in the equipment that they already own modular scalability the modular design of our products allows users to scale and upgrade the capabilities of their sans as required our customers are able to meet their evolving storage and performance needs through the incremental installation or upgrade of hubs switches and san management features increased network stability our proprietary reflex feature is integrated in all of our products and is designed to automatically bypass faulty links and devices to help ensure network stability our proprietary perfectport feature is designed to increase the reliability of each fibre channel link to our hub or switch products this enhances the reliability of the san in addition the use of perfectport in each link enables all devices in the san to be interconnected without limitation in the number of network devices or the distance between san devices platform for advanced data management our products are designed to allow storage devices to share data without the intervention of a server this feature creates a platform that helps enable thirdparty applications such as serverless backup an application that allows backups to be performed over a san without a server serverless backup helps alleviate servers and local area networks of backup traffic so they can more effectively serve clients full description the ipo profiles may contain historical records please visit the latest ipos for the most recent information
