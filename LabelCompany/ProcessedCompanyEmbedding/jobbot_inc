to seven members concepts  good times burgers  frozen custard we operate good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants with two different formats that have evolved over the course of our history a smaller  to  square foot building without indoor seating that is focused on drivethrough service and limited walk up service and a  square foot  seat dining room  we have further refined the prototype design to reduce development costs and improve the return on investment model for future companyowned and franchised restaurant expansion with a  square foot  seat dining room design that will carry forward all of the core design elements that enhance our higher quality allnatural brand image we operate at the upper end of the quick service restaurant   qsr   category in terms of the quality of our ingredients and pricing strategy without a  menu or deep discounting   consumer research has shown us that the customer feels a strong connection to us and feels better about choosing good times burgers  frozen custard over the larger hamburger qsr brands due to the quality of our ingredients and brand personality  as a result we have developed a communications umbrella called  happiness made to order  with three primary brand pillars of innovation quality and connectedness  all of our product initiatives are designed to support a brand position that adds differentiation to our concept within the landscape of qsr competitors particularly in the hamburger segment  within innovation we strive to create products and flavor profiles available only at good times burgers  frozen custard that challenge qsr norms  within quality our products are supported by fresh all natural handcrafted attributes using high quality regional ingredients  within connectedness we strive to create connections with our customers based on the colorado lifestyle local brand partners and community support and involvement   we believe good times burgers  frozen custard is the only qsr chain in the region serving fresh all natural angus beef and all natural chicken with no hormones no steroids no antibiotics and humanely raised animals with no animal byproducts in the feed we continued to promote our core product introductions in fiscal  with a combination of limited time offers and permanent product introductions including our boneless hand breaded all natural chicken sweet potato fries summer and holiday shakes  hatch valley new mexico green chile breakfast burritos fresh frozen custard items and toppings for our wild fries and fresh cut fries  during  we plan to focus on innovation and improvements in each of our menu categories of burgers chicken sides frozen custard and breakfast while our primary value proposition for the consumer is derived from the quality of ingredients and taste of our products the current competitive and consumer spending environment continues to redefine value expectations within the qsr segment and a larger number of transactions are being driven by the availability of menu items at lower price points  our lower priced options are consistent with our brand strategy to offer fresh real handcrafted food with unique flavor profiles in our core menu categories of burgers chicken fries frozen custard and fountain products and we continue to evolve our overall menu price ranges available for our customers including a lower tier option a midtier everyday option and a premium tier for specialty products  we will continue to focus on elevating the attributes of our menu items that we believe give us a unique position in hamburger quick service restaurants  fresh all natural angus beef and all natural chicken that is free from hormones steroids and antibiotics and humanely raised with no animal byproducts in the feed fresh frozen custard made fresh every few hours in every restaurant fresh grilled honey cured bacon fresh lemonade fresh cut fries allnatural handbreaded  chicken freshly sliced produce and toppings such as real guacamole and sautéed mushrooms  we continue to invest in new equipment with the goal of achieving a more hotoffthegrill cooked to order flavor that is more common in fast casual and casual theme concepts than in quick service restaurants and with the goal of providing the best quality french fries we can bad daddy  s burger bar bad daddy  s burger bar operates in the emerging  small box  grill and bar segment which has a higher average check and we believe is a step above fast casual concepts such as five guys and smashburger and casual theme concepts such as chili  s and red robin in terms of food quality and price points but below  polished casual  or sports themed big box concepts such as bj  s cheesecake factory and buffalo wild wings the average size of a bad daddy  s burger bar prototype restaurant is approximately  to  square feet which is smaller than other grill and bar segment competitors  the menu consists of chef driven recipes within a relatively simple menu of signature burgers salads sandwiches and appetizers in a high energy pop culture oriented atmosphere  the bar is dominated by craft beers and while prominent enough to impact the overall feel of the design we do not believe it is so dominant as to be a turn off for families  we believe the food quality is far superior to casual theme concepts rivaling upscale casual concepts with menu item names that evoke an irreverent personality  bad daddy  s burger bar has been recognized for  best burger  and has received many other accolades by the charlotte north carolina press and community as well as by usa today as being one of the top  best burgers in the country small box dining is the smallest yet fastest growing portion of fast and fullservice casual dining reflecting years of evolution and innovation  we believe that bad daddy  s burger bar combines a reasonable average check high personality and convenient experience innovative recipes and above average quality yielding a strong value proposition  fast casual has exhibited the majority of the growth in the restaurant industry over the last decade and represents the largest segment within small box dining at nearly  billion in sales led by concepts such as panera bread chipotle noodles pei wei five guys and corner bakery we believe that bad daddy  s burger bar is differentiated from other casual grill and bar concepts with a focused yet sufficiently diverse menu featuring a selection of unique chefdeveloped  gourmet  menu items in an atmosphere with a purposefully unsophisticated feel  with a per person average check that is higher than casual theme concepts such as chili  s and red robin bad daddy  s burger bar is similar to burger lounge the counter and bobby  s burger palace but below zinburger five napkin burger and other higher check concepts based on our knowledge of publicly available information about those concepts  bad daddy  s burger bar offers a full bar with the majority of its alcohol sales derived from craft microbrew beers  sales are divided almost equally between lunch and dinner with hours of operation from  am to  pm with restaurants open slightly later on weekends depending on the surrounding trade area based on management  s review of the average sales of the three operating restaurants that have been open for more than one year we anticipate that bad daddy  s restaurants will generate much higher sales per square foot than the average for quick service restaurants and higher than the publicly reported sales per square foot of concepts such as panera bread five guys burgers  fries and bj  s restaurants  we estimate that it will require a cash investment of  to  to open each restaurant in the state of colorado and anticipate a return on investment model that is very competitive in the industry based on our knowledge of existing bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants the bdfd franchise disclosure document our experience todate and other publicly available information of similarly sized restaurant concepts  the existing bad daddy  s burger bar average sales per restaurant are much higher than the good times burgers  frozen custard average sales per restaurant as is their average check bdfd has prepared a franchise disclosure document operating systems and processes and registered trademarks and we anticipate we will pursue expansion through the sale of franchises in certain markets business strategy we are focused on continuing to improve the profitability of drive thru and developing additional good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants in our home state of colorado while developing the bad daddy  s burger bar concept with companyowned restaurants in colorado oklahoma and kansas and with franchised restaurants in other markets in the us allowing us to leverage these strengths and opportunities good times is a  year old company with a vibrant high quality brand        position in colorado    · we have minimal bank debt a healthy balance sheet with positive cash flow from operations and  consecutive quarters of same store sales growth · we have an existing infrastructure with sophisticated systems and processes in place that can be significantly leveraged with a new growth concept · we have the exclusive right to develop bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants in colorado as well as optional development rights in kansas and oklahoma · we have a  ownership interest in bdfd the franchisor of the bad daddy  s burger bar concept which we manage under a management services agreement with the goal of franchising primarily to experienced multiunit operators of other restaurant concepts · we are partnering with successful serial restaurateurs in bad daddy  s burger bar which we believe is an exciting new emerging growth concept our strategies for growing the company include the following  consistently grow same store restaurant sales we will continue to focus on same store restaurant sales driven by increases in customer transactions and increases in the average customer check  same store sales increased  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  and increased  in fiscal  compared to fiscal   we hope to continue to increase same store sales throughout fiscal  through a multifaceted approach to continually improve the good times burgers  frozen custard brand experience for our customers through · utilizing enhanced customer feedback tools to evaluate our execution on the drivers of brand loyalty  food quality speed of service friendliness of employees uniqueness of offerings and customer problem solving · growing the breakfast daypart sales that is currently generating sales of approximately  to  of total sales consisting of hatch valley green chile burritos coffee and orange juice · our line of all natural hand breaded chicken tenderloin products that was introduced in march  which made good times burgers  frozen custard the only qsr chain in colorado offering all natural beef and chicken raised without hormones or antibiotics and vegetarian fed animals · continuing to communicate our core value proposition that is centered on the availability of fresh high quality handcrafted products at several different price points across our menu · augmenting our television advertising with an expanded social media presence · introducing both permanent and limited time products that are only available at good times burgers  frozen custard · improving our drive thru speed of service · continuing our reinvestment in our existing facilities with reimaging and remodeling to bring all of our restaurants to the current brand standards in graphics building finishes and appearance  develop new good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants  we plan to build additional good times restaurants along the  front range  of colorado which primarily consists of the denver marketing area from the southern boundary of the denver metropolitan area to the wyoming border which we believe leverages our existing operational and marketing efficiencies   we plan to explore the feasibility of expanding the good times concept outside of colorado through companyowned and franchised restaurants  improve our income from operations by managing the profitability of incremental sales growth    historically depending on the sales volume of each restaurant we have experienced a  to  profit contribution on incremental sales  by managing the profitability of compounding sales increases we believe we can continue to improve our income from operations as a percentage of total revenues   expand bad daddy  s burger bar we intend to develop additional companyowned bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants during fiscal  and  while laying the foundation for franchise growth through bdfd while we have certain first rights of offer to purchase bdi  s restaurants and bdi  s interest in bdfd we have no absolute rights to do so without bdi  s decision to sell any of its interests and they may be able to sell bdi to a third party   reduce bad daddy  s burger bar prime costs  we believe that to optimize bad daddy  s expansion potential of both companyowned and franchised restaurants that the total combined cost of sales and total labor and benefits costs as a percentage of restaurant sales   prime costs   needs to be consistently below  at the current average restaurant sales volume  we estimate that the impact of colorado  s tip credit minimum wage that increases to  per hour in  increases total labor costs approximately  of restaurant sales as compared to the federal tip credit minimum wage of  per hour  our goal is to work with the management of bdi to continue to explore and refine purchasing efficiencies menu engineering and product development labor efficiencies restaurant staffing strategies and restaurant operating systems to reduce the total prime costs expansion strategy and site selection good times burgers  frozen custard we believe that our highest return on investment opportunity in our good times drive thru inc subsidiary is to focus our growth in colorado for operating and marketing efficiencies off of our existing base of restaurants while building new restaurants within the denver marketing area any development of new good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants will involve our new prototype restaurant design on sites that are on or adjacent to big box or grocery store anchored shopping centers or in high activity and employment areas  our site selection for new restaurants is oriented toward slightly higher income demographic areas than many of our urban locations and most of our targeted trade areas are in relatively high growth areas of the denver and northern colorado markets  we plan to explore a larger expansion of good times outside of colorado with companyowned or franchised restaurants we lease most of our sites  when we do purchase and develop a site we intend to ultimately sell the developed site into the saleleaseback market under a long term lease  our primary site objective is to secure a suitable site with the decision to buy or lease as a secondary objective  our site criteria includes a mix of substantial daily traffic density of at least  people within a three mile radius strong daytime population and employment base retail and entertainment traffic generators good visibility and easy access bad daddy  s burger bar our development of the bad daddy  s burger bar concept in companyowned restaurants will focus on urban and suburban upper income demographic areas with median household incomes over  with a high concentration of daytime employment upscale retail movie theaters and hospitals initially along the front range of colorado bdfd will focus on the sale of multiunit development agreements to experienced wellcapitalized multiunit restaurant operators that have other noncompeting concepts as additional restaurants are developed by bdi and bd of colo  we believe the bad daddy  s burger bar concept has expansion potential in vibrant growing upper scale demographic markets as additional restaurants are developed by bdi and bd of colo bad daddy  s burger bar locations are inline and endcap locations in new and existing shopping center developments using approximately  to  square feet  while our good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants are free standing and require extensive site development and entitlement processes bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants can be developed much more quickly due to the requirement for only a building permit signage approvals and liquor license without the need for extensive on and offsite development or land and zoning submittals and modifications  we estimate that it will take approximately  to  days to develop a bad daddy  s burger bar from the time a building permit is issued good times restaurant locations  we currently operate or franchise a total of thirtyseven good times restaurants of which thirtyfive are in colorado two of the restaurants are in wyoming and are  dual brand   operated pursuant to a dual brand test agreement with taco john  s international total denver co greater metro wyoming companyowned  codeveloped   franchised   dual brand franchised       december   companyowned restaurants   codeveloped   franchise operated restaurants   total restaurants   in december  a good times franchisee closed a low volume restaurant in lakewood colorado  in may  a franchisee terminated its good times franchise agreement in the dual brand test concept and has stopped selling good times products at its north dakota location  in november  we opened a companyowned restaurant in highlands ranch colorado and in december  we closed on the purchase of land for the development of a companyowned restaurant in centennial colorado that we anticipate will open in the spring of  bad daddy  s restaurant locations  we currently operate two bad daddy  s restaurants in the denver colorado greater metropolitan area we expect to open our third colorado location in january  and we have several more locations in various stages of negotiation for development in fiscal  and  menu good times burgers  frozen custard the menu of a good times burgers  frozen custard restaurant is limited to hamburgers cheeseburgers chicken sandwiches french fries onion rings fresh squeezed and frozen lemonades soft drinks and frozen custard products each menu item is made to order at the time the customer places the order and is not preprepared in november  we introduced a breakfast menu consisting of hatch valley green chile breakfast burritos orange juice and coffee  our hamburger patties are made with meyer all natural all angus beef served on a   bun  hamburgers and cheeseburgers are garnished with fresh iceberg lettuce fresh sliced sweet red onions mayonnaise guacamole fresh grilled honey cured bacon and proprietary sauces  the chicken products include  all natural tenderloins that are hand breaded in each restaurant daily  signature chicken products include the  hand breaded tenders   buffalo chicken tender   guacamole bacon chicken tender  and a  tuscan chicken    equipment has been automated and equipped with compensating computers to deliver a consistent product and minimize variability in operating systems all natural angus beef and  all natural chicken are raised without the use of any hormones antibiotics or animal byproducts that are normally used in the open market we believe that all natural beef and chicken deliver a better tasting product and because of the rigorous protocols and testing that are a part of the meyer all natural beef and springer mountain farms chicken processes may also minimize the risk of any foodborne bacteriarelated illnesses fresh frozen custard is a premium ice cream requiring in excess of  butterfat content and  egg yolks with a proprietary vanilla blend that is prepared from highly specialized equipment that minimizes the amount of air that is added to the mix and that creates smaller ice crystals than other frozen dairy desserts  the custard is scooped similarly to hardpacked ice cream but is served at a slightly warmer temperature  the resulting product is smoother creamier and thicker than typical soft serve or hardpacked ice cream products  we serve the frozen custard as vanilla and a flavor of the day in cups and cones specialty sundaes and  spoonbenders  a mix of custard and toppings and we anticipate it will continue to be a significant percentage of sales as we continue to develop and promote custard products the breakfast menu is centered around hatch valley green chile burritos made with our own proprietary green chile recipe using hatch valley new mexico roasted green chiles eggs potatoes and cheese offered with the choice of bacon sausage or chorizo  we also offer a premium coffee made by daz bog a colorado based coffee roaster and pure  orange juice bad daddy  s burger bar the menu of bad daddy  s burger bar consists of high quality handcrafted burgers made from a proprietary blend of chuck and brisket with artisanal cheeses tuna turkey buffalo and chicken sandwiches chopped salads appetizers hand cut fries house made potato chips hand spun milk shakes desserts craft microbrews and a full bar  customers have their choice of  different patty options over  fresh toppings  cheeses and other unusual flavors burger toppings include items such as homemade mozzarella hand breaded applewood smoked bacon pesto and recipes such as the  bad ass burger   mama ricotta  s burger  and  emilio  s chicken sandwich    chopped salads include the  texican chicken salad  the  stella  s greek salad  and create your own salad options  bad daddy  s burger bar strives to provide proprietary flavors and recipes available nowhere else with fresh handcrafted quality throughout the menu including rotating chef specials that often utilize ingredients that are local to each market marketing  advertising good times burgers  frozen custard our marketing strategy for good times burgers  frozen custard focuses on  driving same store restaurant sales through attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers  communicating specific product news and attributes to build strong points of difference from competitors and  communicating a unique strong and consistent brand personality media is an important component of building our brand awareness and distinctiveness  we spent most of our broadcast advertising dollars on cable television media during fiscal  and fiscal   the colorado market is an expensive media market so most of our advertising placement is not in prime time but in early and late fringe prime access and late news time slots   we augment our cable television advertising with a social media presence that affords us a higher level of engagement with current customers and an increased level of product giveaways to support high sales opportunity products we plan to continue to be active in digital and social media in order to create more customer engagement with our brand and to target specific consumer segments  we have increased our facebook  likes  by approximately  during fiscal  from fiscal    we anticipate leveraging our customer email database and website to create cost effective channels to target existing customers and increase their frequency bad daddy  s burger bar our marketing strategy for bad daddy  s burger bar focuses on iconic instore merchandising materials and local store marketing to the surrounding trade area around each restaurant including public relations and community based events  the focus is not on market wide promotions or marketing but on the instore customer experience building word of mouth reputation and recommendations and local public relations based on the prior awards and recognitions received by bad daddy  s in its current market of charlotte north carolina  we utilize trade area specific direct mail materials particularly in support of new restaurant openings to drive trial and initial awareness as well as targeted social media marketing  we plan to develop an expanded menu of rotating chef specials featuring unique taste profiles and local ingredients for burgers salads sandwiches and appetizers supported by trade area specific beer offerings and bar promotions operations drive thru bdi and bd of colo have extensive operating training and quality control systems in place and we plan to take a  best practices  approach with management of bdi and bdfd to adapt our systems and processes where practicable for the bad daddy  s burger bar concept except where noted below restaurant management each good times burgers  frozen custard restaurant employs a general manager one to two assistant managers and approximately  to  employees most of whom work parttime during three shifts  an eight to ten week training program is utilized to train restaurant managers on all phases of the operation  ongoing training is provided as necessary  we believe that incentive compensation of our restaurant managers is essential to the success of our business  accordingly in addition to a salary managerial employees may be paid a bonus based upon proficiency in meeting financial customer service and quality performance objectives tied to a monthly scorecard of measures  most of our managers participate in a bonus plan based on their performance against their monthly financial operating customer and people development scorecard metrics bad daddy  s burger bar was developed as a chef driven concept and utilizes a team of four to six managers in its operations at each restaurant managers are trained in back of the house skills prep kitchen positions line management front of the house service positions host server bar and all management functions   as a full service concept the experience qualifications and compensation differs from good times burgers  frozen custard and we recruit and train a separate operating team for the company  s bad daddy  s burger bar operations in april  we hired scott somes and mike maloney to lead the operations of bdfd and bd of colo both of whom have extensive experience in managing and developing full service restaurants  our managers participate in a bonus pool for each restaurant based on a percentage of sales  bonuses are awarded based on achieving financial customer service and people development goals and metrics  operational systems and processes we believe that we have high level operating systems and processes relative to those in the industry for both of our concepts  detailed processes have been developed for hourly daily weekly and monthly responsibilities that drive consistency across our system of restaurants and performance against our standards within different day parts  we utilize a labor program to determine optimal staffing needs of each restaurant based on its actual customer flow and demand  we also employ several additional operational tools to continuously monitor and improve speed of service food waste food quality sanitation financial management and employee development  in fiscal  we implemented a new point of sale computer system at all of our good times restaurants that will improve our ability to analyze transaction sales mix and employee data that we believe can decrease our food waste and improve the effectiveness of store level marketing initiatives  the order system at each good times burgers  frozen custard restaurant is equipped with an internal timing device that displays and records the time each order takes to prepare and deliver  during fiscal  the average total transaction time for good times from the point of order to the delivery of food at the window was approximately  seconds  our goal is to reduce that total transaction time to  seconds or less we use several sources of customer feedback to evaluate each restaurant  s service and quality performance including an extensive secret shopper program at good times restaurants customer comment phone line telephone surveys and website comments  during fiscal  we implemented a new customer feedback tool that aggregates all social media comments as well as store by store surveys each week for each good times restaurant  we believe that information will assist us in evaluating opportunities for improved execution of the customer experience training we strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants for both good times and bad daddy  s through the careful training and supervision of all our employees at all levels and the establishment of and adherence to high standards relating to personnel performance food and beverage preparation and maintenance of our restaurants  each manager must complete an eight to ten week training program be certified on several core processes and is then closely supervised to show both comprehension and capability before they are allowed to manage autonomously  all of our training and development is based upon a  train test certify retrain  cycle around standards and operating processes at all levels  we conduct a semiannual performance review with each manager to discuss prior performance and future performance goals   we have a defined weekly and monthly goal setting process around service employee development financial management and store maintenance goals for every restaurant  additionally we have a library of video training tools to drive training efficiencies and consistency and we are currently developing the same platform for the bad daddy  s operations recruiting and retention we seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and operating partners  we support employees by offering competitive wages and benefits including a k plan medical insurance and incentive plans at every level that are tied to performance against key goals and objectives  we motivate and prepare our employees by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement  we also provide various other incentives including vacations car allowances monthly performance bonuses and monetary rewards for managers who develop future managers for our restaurants  we have implemented an online screening and hiring tool that has proven to reduce hourly employee turnover franchising for good times burgers  frozen custard we have prepared form area rights and franchise agreements a franchise disclosure document   fdd   and advertising material to be utilized in soliciting prospective franchisees however we have not been actively soliciting new good times franchisees  we have historically sought to attract franchisees that are experienced restaurant operators well capitalized and have demonstrated the ability to develop one to five restaurants  we review sites selected for franchises and monitor performance of franchise units  we are not currently soliciting new franchisees and anticipate building additional companyowned good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants but may choose to begin to solicit new franchisees for markets outside of colorado we estimate that it will cost a good times burgers  frozen custard franchisee on average approximately  to  to open a restaurant with dining room seating including preopening costs and working capital assuming the land is leased  a franchisee typically will pay a royalty of  of net sales an advertising materials fee of at least  of net sales plus participation in regional advertising up to an additional  of net sales or a higher amount approved by the advertising cooperative and initial development and franchise fees totaling  per restaurant  among the services and materials which we provide to franchisees are site selection assistance plans and specifications for construction of the good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants an operating manual which  includes product specifications and quality control procedures training onsite opening supervision and advice from time to time relating to operation of the franchised restaurants after a good times burgers  frozen custard franchise agreement is signed we actively work with and monitor our franchisees to ensure successful franchise operations as well as compliance with our systems and procedures  during the development phase we assist in the selection of sites and the development of prototype and building plans including all required changes by local municipalities and developers  we provide an opening team of trainers to assist in the opening of the restaurant and training of the employees  we advise the franchisee on menu management training marketing and employee development  on an ongoing basis we conduct standards reviews of all franchise restaurants in key areas including product quality service standards restaurant cleanliness and sanitation food safety and people development we have entered into eleven good times  frozen custard franchise agreements in the greater denver metropolitan area  in addition seven jointventure restaurants are operating in the denver metropolitan area media market  dualbranded franchised restaurants operate in gillette and sheridan wyoming for bad daddy  s burger bar our focus on franchising will be through our ownership in and management of bdfd  bdfd has a current fdd form area rights and franchise agreements and two existing franchise agreements signed  we intend to expand the marketing of bad daddy  s burger bar franchises on a broader scale as the concept is further developed by bdi and bd of colo  we anticipate that a franchisee will typically pay a royalty of  to  of net sales and will participate in an advertising fund and local advertising by contributing up to  of net sales   initial development and franchise fees are projected to be  per restaurant  we estimate that it will cost a bad daddy  s burger bar franchisee  to  to open a  to  square foot restaurant in an inline or endcap retail center based on the bdfd franchise disclosure document and our knowledge of the development costs of the existing bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants  bdfd will provide similar support services to its franchisees and licensees that we provide to good times burgers  frozen custard franchises  bdfd has entered into seven license agreements for restaurants in north carolina operated by bdi three license agreements for restaurants in colorado and two franchise agreements management information systems financial and management control is maintained through the use of automated data processing and centralized accounting and management information systems that we provide  sales labor and cash data is collected daily via a restaurant back office system which gathers data from the restaurant pointofsale system  management receives daily weekly and monthly reports identifying food labor and operating expenses and other significant indicators of restaurant performance  the major management information systems are divided by function · restaurant point of sale · restaurant backofhouse · financial · payrollhuman resources and · internal operational reports we believe that these reporting systems are sophisticated and enhance our ability to control and manage operations  we recently implemented new point of sale equipment for our good times restaurants that is the same as used in our bad daddy  s restaurants food preparation quality control  purchasing we believe that we have excellent food quality standards relative to the industry  our systems are designed to protect our food supply throughout the preparation process  we inspect specific qualified manufacturers and work together with those manufacturers to provide specifications and quality controls  our operations management teams are trained in a comprehensive safety and sanitation course provided by the national restaurant association  minimum cook temperature requirements and line checks throughout the day ensure the safety and quality of both burgers and other items we use in our restaurants we currently purchase  of the food and paper supplies for our good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants and the majority of the food and paper supplies for our bad daddy  s restaurants from food services of america  in addition we maintain multiple approved suppliers for all key components of our menu to mitigate risk and ensure supply  suppliers are chosen based upon their ability to provide i a continuous supply of product that meets all safety and quality specifications ii logistics expertise and freight management iii product innovation and differentiation iv customer service v transparency of business relationships and vi competitive pricing  specified products are distributed to all restaurants through food services of america under a negotiated  contract directly to our restaurants two to four times per week depending on restaurant requirements  we do not believe that the current reliance on this sole distributor will have any longterm material adverse effect since we believe that there are a sufficient number of other suppliers from which food and paper supplies could be purchased with little or no interruption in service  we do not anticipate any difficulty in continuing to obtain an adequate quantity of food and paper supplies of acceptable quality and at acceptable prices employees at september   we had approximately  employees of which  are hourly employees and  are salaried employees working full time  we consider our employee relations to be good  none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement competition the restaurant industry including the fast food segment is highly competitive  good times burgers  frozen custard competes with a large number of other hamburgeroriented fast food restaurants in the areas in which it operates  many of these restaurants are owned and operated by regional and national restaurant chains many of which have greater financial resources and experience than we do  restaurant companies that currently compete with good times burgers  frozen custard in the denver market include mcdonald  s burger king wendy  s carl  s jr sonic jack in the box and freddy  s  double drivethrough restaurant chains such as rally  s hamburgers and checker  s drivein restaurants which currently operate a total of over  double drivethrough restaurants in various markets in the united states are not currently operating in colorado  culver  s and freddy  s are the only significant competitors offering frozen custard as a primary menu item operating in the denver and colorado springs markets and both have a significant presence in midwestern markets that may be targeted for expansion  additional  fast casual  hamburger restaurants are being developed in the colorado market such as smashburger and five guys however they do not have drivethrough service and generate an average per person check that is approximately  higher than the average check at a good times burgers  frozen custard restaurant we believe that good times burgers  frozen custard may have a competitive advantage in terms of quality of product compared to traditional fast food hamburger chains  early development of our double drivethrough concept in colorado has given us an advantage over other double drivethrough chains that may seek to expand into colorado because of our brand awareness and present restaurant locations  nevertheless we may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant chains with greater name recognition and marketing capability  furthermore most of our competitors in the fastfood business operate more restaurants have been established longer and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do  there is also active competition for management personnel as well as for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants bad daddy  s burger bar competes with both local and national grill and bar concepts and gourmet  better burger  concepts  as the concept is expanded bad daddy  s burger bar will compete against concepts such as red robin chili  s burger lounge the counter and bobby  s burger palace  there are other burgercentric fast casual concepts such as five guys burgers  fries and smashburger that operate at a lower average customer check than bad daddy  s burger bar and others such as zinburger bare burger and five napkin burger that operate with a higher average customer check  we believe that bad daddy  s burger bar has an advantage in the handcrafted quality of its food distinctiveness of its atmosphere and uniqueness of its menu offerings  nevertheless bad daddy  s burger bar may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant chains with greater name recognition intellectual property we have registered our mark  good times drive thru burgers  sm with the state of colorado  we have also registered our mark  good times burgers  frozen custard  federally and with the state of colorado  we received approval of our federal registration of  good times  in   in addition we own trademarks or service

license the use of the mark the trademarks and the proprietary aspects of the bad daddy  s burger bar operating system such as for example operating manuals unique design elements and the unique equipment of the restaurants and the unique recipes are owned by bdi  bdi has licensed the trademarks and such intellectual property aspects to bdfd for its use in  sublicensing and franchising the

to use such intellectual property in accordance with reasonable directions from bdi and the license can be terminated following any breach of the foregoing by bdfd which is not cured within  days after written notice of such breach because of bdi  s  ownership of bdfd and its designation of a majority of the bdfd managers along with bdfd  s intention to use the intellectual property in an approved manner the company views the possibility of such termination to be remote government regulation each of our restaurants is subject to the regulations of various health sanitation safety and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located  difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant  federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations  we are subject to the fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions  in addition we are subject to the americans with disabilities act which requires restaurants and other facilities open to the public to provide for access and use of facilities by the handicapped  management believes that we are in compliance with the americans with disabilities act   we will be subject to the affordable care act beginning in  and believe that we will have the required health insurance benefits for eligible employees we are also subject to federal and state laws regulating franchise operations which vary from registration and disclosure requirements in the offer and sale of franchises to the application of statutory standards regulating franchise relationships  many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreements including limitations on noncompetition provisions and the termination or nonrenewal of a franchise  some states require that franchise materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in that state  in addition each bad daddy  s burger bar restaurant requires a liquor license and adherence to the attendant laws and requirements regulating the serving and consumption of alcohol  alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various aspects of these restaurants  daily operations including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing and inventory control handling and storage  typically licenses to sell alcoholic beverages will require annual renewal and may be suspended or revoked at any time for

statements are included in this form k principally in the sections captioned business and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  forwardlooking statements are related to among other things · business objectives and strategic plans · operating strategies · our ability to open and operate additional restaurants profitably and the timing of such openings · restaurant and franchise acquisitions · anticipated price increases · expected future revenues and earnings comparable and noncomparable restaurant sales results of operations and future

and uncertainties in some cases information regarding certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements appears together with such statement  in addition the factors described under critical accounting policies and estimates in part ii item  and risk factors in part i item a as well as other possible factors not listed could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements including without limitation the following concentration of restaurants in certain markets and lack of market awareness in new markets changes in disposable income consumer spending trends and habits increased competition in the quick service restaurant market costs and availability of food and beverage inventory our ability to attract qualified managers employees and franchisees changes in the availability of capital or credit facility borrowings costs and other effects of legal claims by employees franchisees customers vendors stockholders and others including settlement of those claims effectiveness of management strategies and decisions weather conditions and related events in

statements  except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances item a risk factors you should consider carefully the following risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to the company  s securities you are cautioned that the risk factors discussed below are not exhaustive we have accumulated losses we have incurred losses in every fiscal year in our  years since inception except in four fiscal years  as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of   we may have a loss for the current fiscal year ending september   or we may not be profitable if we are unable to continue to increase same store sales at existing restaurants our ability to attain profitability may be adversely affected we must increase same store sales at our existing restaurants to attain profitability which we have done for the past  consecutive quarters  sales increases will depend in part on the success of our advertising and promotion of new and existing menu items and consumer acceptance  we cannot assure that our advertising and promotional efforts will in fact be successful  if our same store sales decrease and our other operating costs increase our ability to attain profitability will be adversely affected new restaurants when and if opened may not be profitable if at all for several months  we anticipate that our new restaurants when and if opened will generally take several months to reach normalized operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants including lack of market awareness the need to hire and train a sufficient number of employees operating costs which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter preopening costs and other factors  in addition restaurants opened in new markets may  open at lower average weekly sales volumes than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher restaurantlevel operating expense ratios than in existing markets  sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach average annual companyowned restaurant sales if at all thereby affecting the profitability of these restaurants our operations are susceptible to the cost of and changes in food availability which could adversely affect our operating results  our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs  various factors beyond our control including adverse weather conditions governmental regulation production availability recalls of food products and seasonality may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply chain  we enter into annual contracts with our chicken and other miscellaneous suppliers  our contracts for chicken are fixed price contracts  our contracts for beef are generally based on current market prices plus a processing fee  changes in the price or availability of chicken or beef or other commodities could materially adversely affect our profitability  we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results  in addition because we provide a  valuepriced  product we may not be able to pass along price increases to our customers macroeconomic conditions could affect our operating results the recent economic downturn continuing disruptions in the overall economy including the ongoing impacts of the housing crisis high unemployment and financial and market volatility and the related declines in business and consumer confidence adversely affected customer traffic and sales throughout the restaurant industry including the qsr category  for example our same store sales decreased in fiscal  fiscal  and the first ten months of fiscal   if the economy experiences another downturn or there are continued uncertainties regarding economic recovery consumer spending may be affected which may adversely affect our sales in the future  a proliferation of heavy discounting by our major competitors may also negatively affect our sales and operating results price increases may impact customer visits  we may make price increases on selected menu items in order to offset increased operating expenses we believe will be recurring  although we have not experienced significant consumer resistance to our past price increases future price increases may deter customers from visiting our restaurants or affect their purchasing decisions the hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive the hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive  our competitors in the qsr segment include many recognized national and regional fastfood hamburger restaurant chains such as mcdonald  s burger king wendy  s carl  s jr sonic jack in the box freddy  s and culver  s  we also compete with small regional and local hamburger and other fastfood restaurants many of which feature drivethrough service  most of our competitors have greater financial resources marketing programs and name recognition than we do  discounting by our qsr competitors may adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our restaurants while bad daddy  s burger bar operates in the  better burger  restaurant segment it offers a relatively broad menu and competes with other full service restaurants such as chili  s red robin and other local and regional full service restaurants  additionally customers of both our good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants and new bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants are also customers of fast casual hamburger restaurants such as five guys burgers  fries and smashburger sites for new restaurants may be difficult to acquire  location of our restaurants in hightraffic and readily accessible areas is an important factor for our success  our good times burgers  frozen custard drivethrough restaurants require sites with specific characteristics and there are a limited number of suitable sites available in our geographic markets  bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants will be operated out of leased inline and endcap retail locations as opposed to freestanding good times burgers  frozen custard locations  since suitable locations are in great demand in the future we may not be able to obtain optimal sites for either of our restaurant concepts at a reasonable cost  in addition we cannot assure you that the sites we do obtain will be successful if our franchisees cannot develop or finance new restaurants build them on suitable sites or open them on schedule our growth and success may be impeded  franchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules  from time to time in the past we have agreed to extend or modify development schedules and we may do so in the future  any of these problems could slow our growth and reduce our franchise revenues  additionally our franchisees depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants  difficulty in obtaining adequate financing adversely affects the number and rate of new restaurant openings by our franchisees and adversely affects our future franchise revenues  we do not presently have any franchised restaurants under development  our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business  franchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees  we provide training and support to franchisees however franchisees operate their restaurants as independent businesses  consequently the quality of franchised restaurant operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control  moreover franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel  our image and reputation and the image and reputation of other franchisees may suffer materially and systemwide sales could significantly decline if our franchisees do not operate successfully we depend on key management employees  we believe our current operations and future success depend largely on the continued services of our management employees in particular boyd e hoback our president and chief executive officer and scott lefever our vice president of operations  although we have entered into an employment agreement with mr hoback he may voluntarily terminate his employment with us at any time  in addition we do not currently maintain keyperson insurance on messrs hoback  s or lefever  s life  the loss of messrs hoback  s or lefever  s services or other key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations labor shortages could slow our growth or harm our business  our success depends in part upon our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified highenergy employees  qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some areas  the inability to recruit and retain these individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants which could harm our business  additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees which could result in higher labor costs  most of our employees are paid on an hourly basis  the employees are paid in accordance with applicable minimum wage regulations  accordingly any increase in the minimum wage whether state or federal could have a material adverse impact on our business we are subject to extensive government regulation that may adversely hinder or impact our ability to govern various aspects of our business including our ability to expand and develop our restaurants  the restaurant industry is subject to various federal state and local government regulations including those relating to the sale of food  while in the past we have been able to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental licenses permits and approvals our failure to maintain these licenses permits and approvals including food licenses could adversely affect our operating results  difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants  local authorities may suspend or deny renewal of our food licenses if they determine that our conduct does not meet applicable standards or if there are changes in regulations various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs  these laws govern minimum wage requirements overtime pay meal and rest breaks unemployment tax rates workers  compensation rates citizenship or residency requirements child labor regulations and sales taxes  additional governmentimposed increases in minimum wages overtime pay paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits may increase our operating costs the federal americans with disabilities act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment  although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons we are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensorlicensee relationship  many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement including limitations on noncompetition provisions and the termination or nonrenewal of a franchise  some states require that franchise materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in the state our bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants will also be subject to state and local laws that regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages  alcoholic beverage control regulations will govern various aspects of these restaurants  daily operations including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing and inventory control handling and storage  typically licenses to sell alcoholic beverages will require annual renewal and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause the definition of which varies by locality  the failure of any of our bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants to timely obtain and maintain any required licenses permits or approvals to serve alcoholic beverages could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant or prevent regular daytoday operations including the sale of alcoholic beverages at a restaurant that is already operating any of which would adversely affect our business  health concerns relating to the consumption of beef chicken or other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations  like other restaurant chains consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the avian influenza also known as bird flu or the consumption of beef the key ingredient in many of our menu items or negative publicity concerning food quality illness and injury generally such as negative publicity concerning e coli  mad cow  or  footandmouth  disease publication of government or industry findings concerning food products served by us or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants  this negative publicity may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in customer traffic to our restaurants  if we react to the negative publicity by changing our concept or our menu we may lose customers who do not prefer the new concept or menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable  in addition we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of a concept change and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors  a decrease in customer traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept could materially harm our business risks related to bad daddy  s relationship our ability to succeed with the bad daddy  s burger bar restaurant concept will require significant capital expenditures and management attention  we believe that new openings of bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants are likely to serve as a contributor of our new unit growth and increased profitability over the longer term based on the unit economics of that concept  our ability to succeed with this new concept will require significant capital expenditures and management attention and is subject to certain risks in addition to those of opening a new good times burgers  frozen custard restaurant including customer acceptance of and competition with the bad daddy  s burger bar concept  if the  rampup  period for new bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants does not meet our expectations our operating results may be adversely affected  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop and grow the bad daddy  s burger bar concept to a point where it will become profitable or generate positive cash flow  we may not be able to attract enough customers to meet targeted levels of performance at new bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants because potential customers may be unfamiliar with the concept or the atmosphere or menu might not be appealing to them  if we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies for bad daddy  s burger bar our business and results of operations may be adversely affected our growth including the development of bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants may strain our management and infrastructure  in addition to new openings of bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants we also plan to remodel and reimage existing good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants  in addition we believe there may be opportunities to open or franchise new good times burgers  frozen custard restaurants from time to time   this growth will increase our operating complexity and place increased demands on our management and infrastructure including our current restaurant management systems financial and management controls and information systems  if our infrastructure is insufficient to support our growth our ability to open new restaurants including the development of the bad daddy  s burger bar concept would be adversely affected bad daddy  s burger bar is subject to all of the risks of a relatively new business including competition and there is no guarantee of a return on our capital investment into bdfd or bd of colo   bad daddy  s burger bar is a relatively new business concept  existing bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants have been in existence for approximately five years and are currently located in north carolina and south carolina  because of the small number of existing bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants and the relatively short period of time that they have been in operation there is substantial uncertainty that additional restaurants in other locations will be successful  there is no guarantee that bdfd will be successful in offering bad daddy  s burger bar franchises throughout the us or that if and when such franchises are granted the restaurants developed by franchisees will be successful  there is also substantial uncertainty that the bdfd franchising business will be successful in view of the facts that bdfd has sold only two bad daddy  s burger bar restaurant franchises to date and that the restaurant franchising business is very competitive  if bdfd is unsuccessful in attracting bad daddy  s burger bar franchisees and accordingly attaining broadbased consumer recognition of the bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants it could adversely affect the revenues of the company  s bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants under the operating agreement of bdfd there will be no distribution of any net cash profits during the first three years unless approved by all the class a members of bdfd  we have acquired a  voting ownership interest in bdfd in exchange for an initial capital contribution of  of which we paid the first  installment on april   and we paid the second  installment in december   the operating agreement of bdfd provides that the company and bdi may be required to make additional capital contributions to bdfd of up to an aggregate of  upon written request of bdfd  s board of managers  such additional capital contributions if required will be in accordance with the company  s and bdi  s then respective percentage interests in  bdfd  accordingly the company  s portion of such additional capital contributions if required prior to any change in bdfd ownership will be up to   if the additional capital contributions are required under the bdfd operating agreement the company intends to pay its required portion out of working capital reserves  however if the company does not have sufficient working capital reserves at the time the capital call is made the company may have to obtain funds from other sources and such funds may not be available to the company on favorable terms or at all under the operating agreement of bdfd there will be no distribution of any net cash profits during the first three years unless approved by all the class a members of bdfd  thus we may not receive any return on our initial capital contribution to bdfd or any subsequent additional capital contribution we may be required to make during the first three years of bdfd  s operations the company does not have a majority voting interest in bdfd and the company  s management services agreement with bdfd has a limited term of three years  the company has acquired a  voting membership interest in bdfd with the remaining  voting membership interest in bdfd currently held by bdi  the operating agreement of bdfd provides that bdfd will be managed by its fivemember board of managers which currently consists of three members designated by bdi and two members designated by the company  accordingly the company does not have a majority voting interest in bdfd nor does it control a majority of the board of managers  as a consequence the company will not be able to control certain decisions regarding bdfd  among other things the annual budget of bdfd will be approved by a majority of the board of managers which majority may be achieved without the participation of the company  s designated managers the company will provide management services to bdfd pursuant to the terms of a management services agreement  however the term of the management services agreement between the company and bdfd is limited to three years and may be terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement  among other things bdfd may terminate the management services agreement prior to the end of its threeyear term based on the failure of bdfd to achieve certain franchise sales goals  if bdfd terminates the management services agreement prior to the end of its threeyear term or if the management services agreement is not renewed by the parties at the end of three years the company will not have a right to manage bdfd or receive any management fee in connection therewith if the company fails to comply with the development schedule under its license agreement with bdfd it will lose its exclusive development rights in colorado and its additional development rights in oklahoma and kansas  the license agreement requires that bd of colo develop at least two restaurants per year in colorado over a fiveyear period after which bd of colo may elect to develop additional bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants in colorado in numbers determined by it  in the event that the company fails to comply with such development schedule then i the company  s right to develop any additional bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants in colorado under the license agreement will thereafter terminate automatically and ii bdfd may establish operate or grant to other third parties the right to establish or operate bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants in colorado subject to bd of colo  s territory rights with respect to any existing restaurant  accordingly if bd of colo fails to meet its development schedule it will lose its exclusive right to develop bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants in colorado in addition pursuant to the operating agreement of bdfd bd of colo has a right to develop bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants in oklahoma and kansas to the extent that such territory is not then subject to development rights by or part of the protected territory right of any third party franchisee subject to approval of bdfd  s board of managers conditioned on certain performance requirements with respect to its colorado restaurants and pursuant to a minimum development schedule to be agreed upon with bdfd for kansas and oklahoma  if bd of colo fails to meet such performance results with respect to its colorado restaurants or fails to meet its development schedule for oklahoma or kansas it will not have any right to develop additional bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants in oklahoma and kansas if the company  s license agreement with bdfd is terminated the company will lose all rights to use the bad daddy  s burger bar name and intellectual property  the company has entered into a license agreement with bdfd for an initial term of  years which is thereafter renewable by the company for two additional year terms  the license agreement may be terminated by bdfd in the event of any uncured default by the company thereunder  in the event of termination the license agreement provides that bdfd will have an option to purchase the company  s bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants for a price mutually agreed by the parties or their independently appraised value  alternatively if bdfd does not exercise its purchase option the company must modify the restaurants to eliminate the use of the bad daddy  s burger bar name and intellectual property  if any of such events were to occur our results of operations would be adversely affected  bdi has a dragalong right regarding the company  s interest in bdfd in the event that bdi proposes to sell its interests in bdfd after the fifth anniversary of the company  s investment in bdfd  the operating agreement contains dragalong rights allowing bdi to require the company to participate in a proposed sale of bdfd or all of its outstanding ownership interests if approved by bdi and its designated managers at any time after april   the fifth anniversary of the company  s investment in bdfd subject to certain conditions  thus after five years bdi could force the company to sell its membership interest in bdfd in a transaction which is not approved by the company or its designated managers of bdfd and which may not be in the company  s best interest  that is with regard to such a forced sale what may be deemed by bdi for its own particular reasons and circumstances to be an advantageous time for it to sell its interest in bdfd may be a disadvantageous time for the company to sell under its particular circumstances conflicts of interest may arise as a result of the company  s status as a substantial owner of bdfd and its status as a licensee of bdfd  the company is both a  owner of bdfd and a licensee of bdfd  in its capacity as a substantial owner and manager of bdfd the company will be obligated to require bdfd franchisees to comply with all of the terms of their franchise agreements  this in turn may make it unfeasible as a practical matter for bd of colo to obtain consents from bdfd for variations of such terms that the company believes are appropriate for the particular circumstances of the bd of colo restaurants  for example the company may wish to be able to add a nonstandard menu item to its bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants which will be uniquely popular in a particular geographic location which under such circumstances bdfd would normally allow but which it would not wish to allow for other licensees in that event bdfd may nonetheless not permit such a variation by the company because of a possible claim that it is

shares on the belief that the shares were registered pursuant to the company  s registration statement on form s originally filed with and made effective by the sec on august   the  initial registration statement   and that the issuance did not require a new or updated registration statement  the company became aware that the sec does not view the shares underlying warrants as being  sold  for securities law purposes until the warrants are exercised and therefore it is the view of the sec that the company should have filed a posteffective amendment to the initial registration statement prior to issuing these shares  the sale of these shares upon exercise of the a warrants was therefore not made in compliance with federal and state securities laws because the prospectus did not meet the requirements of section a of the securities act  consequently the holders of a warrants who purchased such shares may seek to rescind the sale in which case we could be liable for

increase in pricing and a  increase in average check from menu mix changes in the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented a new limited item breakfast menu at good times that generated sales of approximately  of total sales in fiscal  compared to  of total sales in fiscal   consistent with our brand position of offering fresh all natural handcrafted products we elected to come to market with authentic hatch valley new mexico green chile burritos at a price point of  each which we believe is both an excellent value for our customer and is highly differentiated from any other offerings in the quick service restaurant category   because we do not offer a broad breakfast menu we are highly labor efficient for that day part resulting in a relatively low breakeven point and higher incremental profitability our outlook for fiscal  for good times is cautiously optimistic based on the last three years of positive sales trends however our sales trends are influenced by many factors we are continuing to manage our marketing communications to balance growth in customer traffic and the average customer expenditure  we plan to open additional good times restaurants in fiscal  and closed on the purchase of land for one restaurant in december  bad daddy  s restaurants  we currently operate two bad daddy  s restaurants in the denver colorado greater metropolitan area we expect

with beef and bacon prices increasing approximately  and  respectively  we anticipate continued cost pressure on several core commodities including beef bacon and dairy and expect our food and

for fiscal  payroll and other employee benefit costs increased  from   of restaurant sales in fiscal  to   of restaurant sales good times payroll and other employee benefit costs were   of restaurant sales up from   of restaurant sales in fiscal  the  increase in payroll and other employee benefit expenses is primarily due to the increase in restaurant sales because payroll costs are semivariable in nature they normally decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales when there is an increase in restaurant sales payroll and other employee benefits increased approximately  in fiscal  due to two restaurants purchased from franchisees in fiscal  and decreased approximately  in fiscal  due to one companyowned restaurant closed in fiscal   we anticipate payroll and other employee benefit costs will decrease as a percentage of sales in fiscal  due to the operating leverage on increasing sales bad daddy  s payroll and other employee benefit costs were   of restaurant sales for fiscal   payroll and other employee benefit costs were abnormally high due to the lower opening sales volume of our first location and the inclusion of costs related to training and regional management we anticipate that these costs as a percentage of restaurant sales will decline as sales increase and additional locations are opened in fiscal  occupancy and other operating costs  for fiscal  occupancy and other operating costs increased  from   of restaurant sales in fiscal  to   of restaurant sales  the  increase in occupancy and other costs is primarily attributable to good times occupancy and other operating costs were   of restaurant sales up from   of restaurant sales in fiscal  the  increase in occupancy and other costs is primarily attributable to a decrease of  in occupancy and other restaurant operating costs due to the restaurant closed in fiscal  offset by the following increases · increase of  in occupancy and other restaurant operating costs due to the two restaurants purchased from franchisees in fiscal  · increases in various other restaurant operating costs of  at existing restaurants comprised primarily of repairs and maintenance property taxes utility costs

incurred  of preopening costs compared to  in fiscal  with the exception of  of costs in fiscal  related to a new good times location all of the fiscal  and  preopening costs are related to the initial bad daddy  s restaurants being developed by bd of colo the first of which opened in february  and the second of which opened in late july  costs for the initial store opening in february  were higher than normal due to payroll travel and lodging costs incurred to train the initial management team in north carolina restaurants depreciation and amortization costs  for fiscal  depreciation and amortization costs decreased  from  in fiscal  to  good times depreciation costs decreased  from  in fiscal  to  primarily due to the restaurant closed in fiscal  as well as due to

administrative costs increased  from   of total revenues in fiscal  to   of total revenues the  increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal  is primarily attributable to · increase in

liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the company provides a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce

accounting policies organization  good times restaurants inc good times or the company is a nevada corporation the company operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries good times drive thru inc drive thru and bd of colorado llc bad daddy  s drive thru commenced operations in  and as of september   operates twentyfive companyowned and joint venture drivethru fast food hamburger restaurants  the company  s restaurants are located in colorado in addition drive thru has eleven franchises nine operating in colorado and two in wyoming and is offering franchises for development of additional drive thru restaurants bad daddy  s commenced operations in  and as of september   operates two companyowned fullservice upscale casual dining restaurants  the company  s restaurants are located in colorado in april  we entered into a series of agreements with bad daddy  s international llc a north carolina limited liability company   bdi   and bad daddy  s franchise development llc a north carolina limited liability company   bdfd   to acquire the exclusive development rights for bad daddy  s burger bar restaurants in colorado additional restaurant development rights for oklahoma and kansas and a  voting ownership interest in the franchisor entity bdfd in april  we executed a subscription agreement for the purchase of  class a units of bdfd representing a  voting membership interest in bdfd for the aggregate subscription price of   the subscription price was payable in two equal installments the first  installment was paid on the date of execution of the subscription agreement and the remaining  installment was paid in december  the company accounts for this investment using the equity method we follow accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board commonly referred to as the  fasb   the fasb sets generally accepted accounting principles gaap that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition results of operations and cash flows principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of good times its subsidiaries and one limited partnership in which the company exercises control as general partner the company owns an approximate  interest in the limited partnership is the sole general partner and receives a management fee prior to any distributions to the limited partner  because the company owns an approximate  interest in the partnership and exercises complete management control over all decisions for the partnership except for certain veto rights the financial statements of the partnership are consolidated into the company  s financial statements  the equity interest of the unrelated limited partner is shown on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the stockholders  equity section as a noncontrolling interest and is adjusted each period to reflect the limited partner  s share of the net income or loss as well as any cash distributions to the limited partner for the period the limited partner  s share of the net income or loss in the partnership is shown as noncontrolling interest income or expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated basis of presentation  the company analyzes its operations on a regional basis when evaluating closed restaurant operations for consideration as to the classification between continuing operations and discontinued operations  as most of the company  s restaurants are within the denver metropolitan region and share common advertising distribution supervision and to a certain extent even customers the company believes it  s appropriate to perform its analysis on a regional basis accounting estimates  the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes  actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents  the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents the company maintains cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions with balances that at times may be in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation   fdic   insured limits of up to   the company has not experienced any losses related to such accounts and management believes that the company is not exposed to any significant risks on these accounts  certain of the company  s accounts exceeded the fdic insured limits as of september   accounts receivable  accounts receivable include uncollateralized receivables from our franchisees and our advertising fund due in the normal course of business generally requiring payment within thirty days of the invoice date on a f periodic basis the company monitors all accounts for delinquency and provides for estimated losses of uncollectible accounts currently and historically there have been no allowances for unrecoverable accounts receivable inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the firstin firstout method and consist of restaurant food items and related packaging supplies property and equipment  property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets generally three to eight years property and equipment under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments and are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major improvements are capitalized  when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the property accounts are relieved of costs and accumulated depreciation with any resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income impairment of longlived assets  we review our longlived assets including land property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the capitalized costs of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and the expected cash flows are based on recent historical cash flows at the restaurant level an analysis was performed for impairment at september   and given the results of our analysis there were no restaurants which are impaired goodwill  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indications of impairment arise including but not limited to a significant decline in cash flows from store operations such tests could result in impairment charges as of september   the company had  of goodwill related to the purchase of a franchise operation on december   there was no impairment required to the acquired goodwill as of september   or  sales of restaurants and restaurant equity interests  sales of restaurants or noncontrolling equity interests in restaurants developed by the company are recorded under either the full accrual method or the installment method of accounting  under the full accrual method a gain is not recognized until the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and the earnings process is virtually complete without further contingencies  when a sale does not meet the requirements for income recognition the related gain is deferred until those requirements are met  under the installment method the gain is incrementally recognized as principal payments on the related notes receivable are collected  if the initial payment is less than specified percentages use of the installment method is followed the company accounts for the sale of restaurants when the risks and other incidents of ownership have been transferred to the buyer  specifically a no continuing involvement by the company exists in restaurants that are sold b sales contracts and related income recognition are not dependent on the future successful operations of the sold restaurants and c the company is not involved as a guarantor on the purchasers  debts deferred liabilities  rent expense is reflected on a straightline basis over the term of the lease for all leases containing stepups in base rent  an obligation representing future payments which totaled  as of september   is reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a deferred liability lease incentives are recorded as a deferred liability when received and subsequently credited to rent expense on a straight line basis over the life of the lease the balance of the lease incentive obligation at september   was  and is reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a deferred liability also included in the  deferred and other liabilities balance is a  deferred gain on the sale of the building and improvements of one companyowned restaurant in a sale leaseback transaction the building and improvements were subsequently leased back from the third party purchaser the gain will be recognized in future periods in proportion to the rents paid on the twenty year lease revenue recognition  revenue from company restaurant sales is recognized when the food and beverage products are sold and are presented net of sales taxes opening costs  restaurant opening costs are expensed as incurred advertising  the company incurs advertising expenses in connection with the marketing of its restaurant operations  advertising costs are expensed when the related advertising begins f franchise and area development fees  individual franchise fee revenue is deferred when received and is recognized as income when the company has substantially performed all of its obligations under the franchise agreement and the franchisee has commenced operations  the company  s commitments and obligations pursuant to the franchise agreements consist of a development assistance including site selection building specifications and equipment purchasing and b operating assistance including training of personnel and preparation and distribution of manuals and operating materials  all of these obligations are effectively complete upon the opening of the restaurant at which time the franchise fee and the portion of any development fee allocable to that restaurant is recognized  there are no additional material commitments or obligations the company has not recognized any franchise fees that have not been collected  the company segregates initial franchise fees from other franchise revenue in the statement of operations  revenues and costs related to companyowned restaurants are segregated from revenues and costs related to franchised restaurants in the statement of operations continuing royalties from franchisees which are a percentage of the gross sales of franchised operations are recognized as income when earned  franchise development expenses which consist primarily of legal costs and restaurant opening expenses associated with developing and opening franchise restaurants are expensed against the related franchise fee income income taxes  we account for income taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the company provides a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value the deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability and valuation allowances are adjusted as necessary  we believe it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized the company is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions the company continues to remain subject to examination by us federal authorities for the years  through  the company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows therefore no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded the companys practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense no accrual for interest and penalties was considered necessary as of september   net income loss per common share  basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period  diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock options for  and  shares of common stock and warrants for  and  shares of common stock were not included in computing diluted eps for  and  respectively because their effects were antidilutive financial instruments and concentrations of credit risk  credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted  concentrations of credit risk whether on or off balance sheet that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions  financial instruments with offbalancesheet risk to the company include lease liabilities whereby the company is contingently liable as a guarantor of certain leases that were assigned to third parties in connection with various sales of restaurants to franchisees see note  financial instruments potentially subjecting the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of receivables  at september   notes receivable totaled  and is due from three entities  additionally the company has other current receivables totaling  which includes  of franchise receivables  due from an affiliate and  for a receivable from the advertising cooperative fund which are all due in the normal course of business the company believes it will collect fully on all notes and receivables the company purchases  of its restaurant food and paper from one vendor the company believes a sufficient number of other suppliers exist from which food and paper could be purchased to prevent any longterm adverse consequences the company operates in one industry segment restaurants  a geographic concentration exists because the company  s customers are generally located in the state of colorado stockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period generally the vesting period of the grant see note  for additional information f variable interest entities  once an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity vie the party with the controlling financial interest the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate it  the company has three franchisees with notes payable to the company  these franchisees are vie  s however the
