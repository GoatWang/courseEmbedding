shifted careers built a new organization that transformed how cancer research is done and now faces the challenge of sustaining the organization and its funding for its newest venture since she was first diagnosed with multiple myeloma mm in  giusti had led an effort to better understand and treat the disease she had cofounded the multiple myeloma research foundation mmrf helped form the multiple myeloma research consortium mmrc and brought together a diverse body of academics researchers pharmaceutical and biotech companies physicians and patients to combine their efforts around the disease the mmrf had helped facilitate clinical trials for promising drugs sponsored research and raised a substantial amount of money for these purposes in  the mmrf was in the midst of its commpass program a multiyear effort to collect tissue samples from  patients at key junctures in their disease sequence these samples to better understand the genetic underpinnings of mm and its many subtypes and thus enable researchers to study a comprehensive sampling of patients commpass also had a patientfacing element which allowed the patient community to communicate with one another and with professional moderators by mid some  patients were enrolled and  hospitals were participating as a nonprofit the mmrf had historically relied on donations to fund its research operations giusti wanted to find a way to ensure a reliable revenue stream for the organization and give it greater financial stability the mmrf had historically given away its resources and knowledge for free in order to speed research giusti worried if charging for some of its functions would be at odds with its mission and historical practices she worked with her executive team to examine potential sources of

event sharpening your skills what do you think working paper summaries  dec  oped encourage breakthrough health care by competing on products rather than patents    for too long the science behind breakthrough therapeutics has been locked behind patents held by universities richard hamermesh proposes the market compete on solutions rather than intellectual property rights    by richard g hamermesh like many people interested in the tangled connections between health care progress and intellectual property rights i avidly followed the myriad genetics case decided by the supreme court this june  in sum molecular diagnostics maker myriad sought the exclusive right to isolate an individuals brca and brca genes but the court wisely i believe made thoughtful distinctions about what is and is not patentable deciding that a naturally occurring dna segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible because it has been isolated… of course had the university of utah not given myriad an exclusive license to a discovery the university made in its own labs there may have been no need for a conflict whatsoever but among other things the dispute resonates deeply with a call to action made by eric lander president and founding director the eli and edythe l broad institute of harvard and mit at novembers healing ourselves health care forum event there lander made a potent case for creating a multicorporate consortium that would openly share validated targets instead of stalling progress by withholding information on targets he argued they should open target data and compete on solutions—compounds and molecules addressing the targets i agree if were going to get the breakthrough products we want at a development cost we can afford we have to figure out the best place to set the line between public and private interests between the intellectual commons that benefits us all and the intellectual property protection that encourages innovation and investment what should be opened to the commons what should be held by private interests “the majority of significant discoveries come from university labs and hospitals” given the stakes these are more than academic questions but i believe the academy can assert leadership on these issues lets face it the majority of significant discoveries come from university labs and hospitals their ownership of intellectual property gives them enormous influence over the distribution of knowledge to date they have been far too concerned with the size of their royalties at the expense of public utility the fate of discoveries we all rely upon and the intellectual property that results from them rests in the hands of university technology licensing offices heres my proposal i ask that the association of university technology managers establish a set of standards balancing public interests and private incentives that would encourage the development of new chemical entities for reducing human suffering as lander had suggested anything having to do with genes molecular pathways and targets should be made openly available or at least not subject to exclusive licensing instead we should encourage competition around the development of molecules that interfere with or enhance activity in these pathways rewarding the creators with the usual private incentives can we agree to compete on therapeutic solutions not on the underlying science we need to develop them id like to hear your reflections on the matter what should be in the commons what should remain private where can we set the line to yield the most

robert e hall marc lieberman richard d de veaux daniel s hamermesh txt customer reviews most helpful customer reviews  of  people found the following review helpful makes microeconomics interesting by dennis thompson i chose to review this one because it was one of the better college textbooks explaining in understandable language the decisions that businesses and individuals make and the effect they have on pricing as well as supply and demand in the economy i certainly enjoyed it more than my macroeconomics textbook but that could be simply because of the nature of the subject at hand when i was younger still in school i was less concerned with broad high level issues than things i could directly relate to and immediately apply my knowledge in i believe that this microeconomics coursebook was what in fact planted a lifelong interest in businesses and particularly startups in me  of  people found the following review helpful alright book by pj the book was in okay condition  gets the job done and push come to shove  however the couple last pages of the book are ripped in half  readable but at the same time can be very frustrating  of  people found the following review
