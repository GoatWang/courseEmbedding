confidence in colgatepalmolive they trust our toothpaste and toothbrushes for their families rely on our soaps and body washes to stay healthy and fresh choose our cleaners to care for their homes and feed our pet foods to the dogs and cats they love colgatepalmolive began earning this confidence more than  years ago by offering the highest quality products and we know the trust we’ve earned over generations has to be earned anew every day earning your trust begins with the ingredients we choose committed to safety and science all of the ingredients we use in our products are safe for people and the environment they meet our strict safety standards and all applicable government regulations everywhere they are sold around the world the decisions we make on ingredients are based on a thorough evaluation of the latest scientific evidence when we choose an ingredient – whether to contribute to the performance of a product or to keep it safe against microorganisms – it is first prescreened by a team of colgatepalmolive scientists every ingredient is assessed alone and within a formula to ensure that nothing unexpected will occur our ingredient review assesses not just what happens in our laboratories but across a range of realworld conditions – during manufacturing in transportation at the store in consumers’ homes and after consumer use we continuously monitor and evaluate the safety of our ingredients and we actively engage outside experts and resources to understand emerging science and deepen our knowledge we seek the facts so that we can make the right decisions listening to consumers we want consumers to continue to have confidence in our products and the ingredients we use our ingredient information is easily accessible in the drug facts labels on our toothpastes and mouthwashes and on the labels of many other products we listen to our consumers and the questions they raise about ingredients where we see opportunities regarding ingredients that are raising consumer questions we substitute with other safe ingredients that provide the same or better benefits without sacrificing quality through this ongoing effort we no longer use – or are on our way to eliminating – some of the ingredients currently raising consumer questions we’re listening and formulating our products with our consumers in mind to keep earning their confidence ingredient updates formaldehyde and formaldehyde donors while formaldehyde and formaldehyde donors are safe when used at approved regulatory levels we recognize that consumers have questions colgatepalmolive does not add formaldehyde to any of our products and is committed to eliminating formaldehyde donors from our formulations globally we do not use formaldehyde donors as a preservative system in any of our oral care products and have eliminated their use in our home care products by the end of  we expect to eliminate their use as a preservative in a limited number of remaining personal care products in north america and latin america parabens parabens are widely used preservatives commonly found in foods cosmetics and drug products they are usually easy to identify by name such as methylparaben propylparaben butylparaben or benzylparaben parabens inhibit the growth of bacteria and mold to maintain product integrity and protect consumer safety parabens have been used for many years reviewed by regulatory bodies around the world and are considered safe however some consumers have questions about their safety to maintain consumer confidence we have reformulated our products using alternative safe preservative systems and are no longer using parabens as of july  us fda parabens consumer update httpwwwfdagovcosmeticsproductsingredientsingredientsucmhtm phthalates

there is no accepted scientific basis for avoiding phthalates some consumers question their safety so as of yearend  we stopped stopped using this ingredient triclosan triclosan is the antibacterial ingredient in colgate total toothpaste where the proven therapeutic benefits it provides as part of our unique copolymer system are unsurpassed colgate total is clinically proven to work better than other toothpastes to reduce the germs that can cause the gum disease gingivitis in the us the food and drug administration fda has recognized the effectiveness and safety of triclosan in colgate total toothpaste we remain strongly committed to colgate total which is the only toothpaste that has undergone the fdas rigorous new drug application process for safety and efficacy it is supported by more than  clinical studies involving over  people its clinically proven benefits are unsurpassed and it is approved by regulators and recommended by the dental profession around the world triclosan has been reviewed and approved as safe by regulators around the world including by an expert european scientific committee that approved the use of triclosan in rinseoff cosmetic products following a full review of the scientific evidence however we recognize that some consumers have questions about triclosan and choose to avoid this ingredient in products where they believe it does not deliver a benefit to health so while the use of triclosan continues to be permitted by regulators around the world we have reformulated our antibacterial dish liquid and hand soaps with alternate active ingredients that provide the same or superior performance us fda triclosan update httpwwwfdagovforconsumersconsumerupdatesucmhtm microplastics colgatepalmolive used microbeads in a limited number of oral care and personal care products to enhance aesthetics and aid in cleaning however some groups raised concerns regarding the potential contribution of microbeads to pollution of the world’s oceans recognizing that consumers have questions as of yearend  we stopped using microbeads more recently consumer questions have extended beyond microbeads to some polymerbased materials many of which
