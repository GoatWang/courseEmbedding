such a new aluminium alloy hotworked products in particular obtained by means of extrusion of the alloy of this invention can be used for example in railway vehicles or in welded structures or can be further formed by means of hydroforming description of the related art  al—mg—si type aluminium alloys such as aluminium association xxx series aluminium alloys are widely used and favoured for their moderately high yield and tensile strength low quench sensitivity good corrosion resistance and favourable forming characteristics aaxxx series alloys are increasingly attractive to industries such as transportation because of these wellknown properties further aaxxx series alloys exhibit in general satisfactory welding characteristics by which this type of alloy is also widely used for applications resulting in the construction of welded structures additional applications for aaxxx series alloys would be possible when ductility is further increased  such an aluminium alloy is known

an object of the invention is to provide a new aluminium alloy suitable for the manufacture of a product made of components having a higher ductility than manufactured from the aluminium alloy known from wo  and further that the aluminium alloy has improved welding properties a further object of the invention is to provide a method for the manufacture of a product made of the new aluminium alloy  according to the invention there is provided an aluminium alloy consisting of the alloying elements in wt  si tomg tofe maxmn to v tocumaxcrmaxznmaxtimax  impurities max  each total max  balance aluminium  by the invention we can provide alloy plate or extrusions having good strength improved ductility good resistance to corrosion and in particular in the case of extruded products exhibits a uniform surface absence of die pickup good longitudinal weld seams and the possibility to extrude complicated shaped sections which can be both thin andor thick walled and can be processed at economic extrusion rates in particular the increased manganese content in the aluminium alloy in accordance with the invention attributes to an improved ductility and a better welding behaviour further the aluminium alloy has improved properties after welding and is less sensitive for hotcracking during welding and after extrusion and heattreatments has a finegrained recrystallized microstructure and further the aluminium alloy has a lower quenchsensitivity than aluminium alloys from the aa aseries type  in a preferred embodiment the aluminium alloy in accordance with the invention has a manganese content in a range of  to  wt  in this range an optimum in mechanical properties and extrudibility is obtained  the aluminium alloy in accordance with the invention has preferably a mnfe ratio in a range of  to  and more preferably in a range of  to   the magnesium content is preferably in a range of  to  wt  in which range the strength is optimised in particular when used in combination with a silicon content in a range of  to  wt  a magnesium content below  wt  does not provide sufficient strength in the component obtained from the alloy of the invention  in another embodiment of the alloy in accordance with the invention the silicon content is in a range of  to  wt  and the magnesium content is a range of  to  wt  and more preferably the magnesium content is in a range of  to  wt  in this particular embodiment of the alloy the mechanical properties of the manufactured component are comparable to those made of an aaalloy  in this type of aluminium alloys vanadium is added to enhance recrystallisation and is present in a range of  to  wt  and more preferably in a range of  to  wt  it should be mentioned that us pat no  alusuisse discloses an aluminium alloy for the manufacture of extruded products were the quench sensitivity with respect to strength can be improved by the addition of vanadium the aluminium alloy contains  to  vanadium and further manganese in a concentration equal to ¼ to ⅔ of the iron concentration  copper should be not more than  wt  copper levels above  wt  gives rise to unacceptable corrosion resistance of products made of the alloy of the invention a more preferred maximum for copper is  wt   chromium improves the corrosion resistance of the alloy however chromium limits the solubility of manganese and further reduces the extrudibility of the aluminium alloy therefor to avoid formation of coarse primaries and to improve extrusion capability the chromium content must not be more than  wt  preferably not more than  wt  and more preferably not more than  wt   zinc is considered to be an impurity element and can be tolerated up to  wt  but is preferably less than  wt   titanium is important as a grain refiner during solidification of both ingots and welded joints produced using the alloy of the invention the preferred range for titanium is not more than  wt   the balance is al and inevitable impurities typically each impurity element is present at  wt  maximum and the total of impurities is  wt  maximum  in addition the invention is embodied in a method for manufacturing a product of the aluminium alloy in accordance with the invention wherein the method comprises the steps of in succession  a casting the alloy into ingots  b homogenising the cast ingot  c hotworking in the homogenised ingot into a product  d ageing of the product  in this way it is achieved that the product acquires excellent properties against a reasonable cost level for the applications which the inventors have in mind  for casting the aluminium alloy into ingots or extrusion billets both continuous and semicontinuous casting processes can be used it has surprisingly been found that during semicontinuous direct chill dccasting of billets the aluminium alloy is significantly less sensitive for cracking during casting the reduced crack sensitivity is mainly attributed to the increased mn content over the known aluminium alloy  after casting the aluminium alloy is homogenised the aim of the homogenising treatment is amongst other things to homogenise the microstructure to dissolve the magnesium and silicon to level off possible residual stresses resulting from the casting process and to spheroidize sharp or needle shaped intermetallic compounds formed during solidification of the aluminium alloy a homogenisation for of  to hours in a temperature in the range of ° c to just below the melting temperature of the aluminium alloy is sufficient a longer homogenisation time is not disadvantageous but is not required and only serves to raise the costs of production preferably the alloy is homogenised for  to  hours in a temperature range of ° c to just below the melting temperature of the aluminium alloy more preferably the alloy is homogenised for  to  hours in a temperature range of  to ° c it has been found that such a high homogenisation temperature is advanteaous for hotworking the alloy by means of extrusion into complex shaped sections which can be both thin walled or thick walled in this manner an acceptable extrusion rate can be maintained despite of the relatively high mncontent further due to the relatively high homogenisation treatment the final product has a finegrained fully recrystallized microstructure  after homogenisation the alloy is hotworked into sheets rods profiles or wire or other shaped materials suitable for processing into products hotworking includes rolling forging and hydroforming the invention is preferably characterised by the ingot or extrusion billet being processed into products via an extrusion process wherein either direct or indirect extrusion may be used the ingot temperature during extrusion is preferably in the temperature range of  to ° c using an extrusion process the aluminium alloy in accordance with the invention can be processed into eg tshaped profiles with a wallthickness of up to  mm and multihollowsections with wallthickness in a range of  to  mm  after hot extrusion the alloy of the invention will be quenched by means of water or water spray or elevated air this is also designated by the term “ pressquenching”  in another embodiment of the method the alloy of the invention will first cool down after the hot extrusion the cooling rate is not so important here cooling will typically take place in air thereafter the alloy is heat treated by keeping it for  to  hours in a temperature range of  to ° c the aim of this heat treatment also known as solution heat treatment is to dissolve amongst other things the silicon and magnesium this solution heat treatment preferably takes place for  to  hours in a temperature range of  to ° c immediately after the solution heat treatment the alloy is preferably cooled to under ° c preferably by means of quenching in water in order to minimise uncontrolled precipitation  in a following step the material is aged to the desired level of mechanical and physical properties the ageing step can be performed by means of natural ageing or artificial ageing by  to  hours annealing in a temperature range of  to ° c this annealing preferably takes place for  to  hours in a temperature range of  to ° c after which cooling to room temperature takes place via cooling to the air  after the complete heat treatment cycle the material can be processed into products of many kinds the aluminium alloy is preferably suitable for application to components which amongst other things require a high capacity for absorbing kinetic energy by plastic deformation such as components suitable for application in railway vehicles the aluminium alloy is further suitable to be applied in welded constructions in particular in vehicle constructions further the aluminium alloy is suitable to be applied in hydroformed structures  the invention is now illustrated by some examples which do not limit the scope of the invention examples  table  lists the chemical composition in weight percent of some comparative materials alloys  to  and alloys which fall within the scope of the invention alloys  these alloys were processed by the steps of  i dccasting of  mm diameter extrusion billets  ii homogenisation see table   iii extrusion at ° c  iv pressquench  v ageing for  hours at ° c  table  lists the homogenisation treatment applied for each alloy the billets were extruded to the following shapes  a tshaped profile with a wallthickness of  mm  b multihollowsection with wallthickness between  and  mm  all results microstructures mechanical properties on front end middle and back end on each investigated extruded products of every type of alloy showed in the extrusion direction only very small variations and therefore a further differentiation within one variant was not necessary the following results are in each and every case mean values out of the different parts of the material  the microstructure in the tshaped thick walled extrusion product a showed in case of alloy  a nonrecrystallized center and a layer of coarse grains with a diameter of about  mm at the surface alloy  showed a nonrecrystallized center and a layer with a thickness of  to  mm of coarse grains near the surface alloy  showed across the whole crosssection of the product a fully recrystallised microstructure with uniform fine grains the microstructure of alloy  was very similar to the microstructure of alloy  the same applied for alloy  and alloy   the microstructure in the multihollow profile b showed in case of alloy  a combination of small and coarse grains and also some nonrecrystallized sections alloy  showed a fully recrystallized microstructure and large differences in the grain size alloy  showed a fully recrystallized microstructure and a more uniform grain size than with alloy  the microstructure of alloy  was very similar to the microstructure of alloy  the same applied for alloy  and alloy   table  lists the results of the testing for mechanical properties where rm is the ultimate tensile strength rp  is the  yield strength and a is the elongation at fracture a in accordance with german standards  from table  it can be seen that an increase of the mn content to above  has a significant effect on the ductility of the extruded product for the tshaped thick walled extrusions it has to mentioned that the specimens for tensile testing have been taken out of the centre of the profiles  mm diameter specimens and therefore show in the case of alloy  and  an increase in the tensile properties due to the nonrecrystallized parts present in the centre it has to be considered however that the mechanical values show significant differences in thickness direction across the shape the values in the center part—as presented in table—are quite high for alloys   and  this is due to the positive effect of testing the nonrecrystallized zones the properties close to the surface in the recrystallized parts are considerably lower in these cases
