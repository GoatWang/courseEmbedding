an american adjunct professor in the department of earth and environmental sciences at columbia university he is best known for his research in climatology his  congressional testimony on climate change that helped raise broad awareness of global warming and his advocacy of action to avoid dangerous climate change in recent years he has become a climate activist to mitigate the effects of climate change on a few occasions leading to his arrest in  hansen advanced an alternative view of global warming over the last  years arguing that during that time frame the negative forcing via aerosols and the positive forcing via co largely balanced each other out and that the ± °c net rise in average global temperatures could mostly be explained by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons however even then he wrote the future balance of forcings is likely to shift toward dominance of co over aerosols contents  early life and education

physics and astronomy in the space science program of james van allen at the university of iowa he obtained a ba in physics and mathematics with highest distinction in  an ms in astronomy in  and a phd in physics in  all three degrees from the university of iowa he participated in the nasa graduate traineeship from  to  and at the same time between  and  he was a visiting student at the institute of astrophysics at the university of kyoto and in the department of astronomy at the university of tokyo hansen then began work at the goddard institute for space studies in  careeredit after graduate school hansen continued his work with radiative transfer models attempting to understand the venusian atmosphere later he applied and refined these models to understand the earths atmosphere in particular the effects that aerosols and trace gases have on earths climate hansens development and use of global climate models has contributed to the further understanding of the earths climate in  his first book storms of my grandchildren was published in  he presented a  ted talk why i must speak out about climate change from  to  he was the head of the nasa goddard institute for space studies in new york city a part of the goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland as of update hansen directs the program on climate science awareness and solutions at columbia universitys earth institute the program is working to continue to connect the dots from advancing basic climate science to promoting public awareness to advocating policy actions research and publicationsedit as a college student at the university of iowa hansen was attracted to science and the research done by james van allens space science program in the physics and astronomy department a decade later his focus shifted to planetary research that involved trying to understand the climate change on earth that will result from anthropogenic changes of the atmospheric composition hansen has stated that one of his research interests is radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres especially the interpretation of remote sensing of the earths atmosphere and surface from satellites because of the ability of satellites to monitor the entire globe they may be one of the most effective ways to monitor and study global change his other interests include the development of global circulation models to help understand the observed climate trends and diagnosing human impacts on climate studies of venusedit venus is surrounded by a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen and its clouds are sulfuric acid the thickness of the atmosphere initially made it difficult to determine why the surface was so hot in the late s and early s following his phd dissertation hansen published several papers on the planet venus venus has a high brightness temperature in the radio frequencies compared to the infrared hansen proposed that the hot surface was the result of aerosols trapping the internal energy of the planet more recent studies have suggested that several billion years ago venuss atmosphere was much more like earths than it is now and that there were probably substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface but a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere hansen continued his study of venus by looking at the composition of its clouds he looked at the nearinfrared reflectivity of ice clouds compared them to observations of venus and found that they qualitatively agreed he also was able to use a radiative transfer model to establish an upper limit to the size of the ice particles if the clouds were actually made of ice evidence published in the early s showed that the clouds consist mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets by  the composition of venus clouds had not yet been determined with many scientists proposing a wide variety of compounds including liquid water and aqueous solutions of ferrous chloride hansen and hovenier used the polarization of sunlight reflected from the planet to establish that the clouds were spherical and had a refractive index and cloud drop effective radius which eliminated all of the proposed cloud types except sulfuric acid kiyoshi kawabata and hansen expanded upon this work by looking at the variation of polarization on venus they found that the visible clouds are a diffuse haze rather than a thick cloud confirming the same results obtained from transits across the sun the pioneer venus project was launched in may  and reached venus late that same year hansen collaborated with larry travis and other colleagues in a  science article that reported on the development and variability of clouds in the ultraviolet spectrum they conclude that there are at least three different cloud materials that contribute to the images a thin haze layer sulfuric acid clouds and an unknown ultraviolet absorber below the sulfuric acid cloud layer the linear polarization data obtained from the same mission confirmed that the low and midlevel clouds were sulfuric acid with radius of about  micrometer above the cloud layer was a layer of submicrometre haze global temperature analysisedit a typical automated airport weather station which records the routine hourly weather observations of temperature weather type wind sky condition and visibility these surface stations are located around the world and are used to derive a global temperature the first giss nasa goddard institute for space studies global temperature analysis was published in  hansen and his coauthor analyzed the surface air temperature at meteorological stations focusing on the years from  to  temperatures for stations closer together than  kilometers were shown to be highly correlated especially in the midlatitudes providing a way to combine the station data to provide accurate longterm variations they conclude that global mean temperatures can be determined even though meteorological stations are typically in the northern hemisphere and confined to continental regions warming in the past century was found to be  °c with warming similar in both hemispheres when the analysis was updated in  the four warmest years on record were all in the s the two warmest years were  and  during a senate meeting on june rd  hansen reported that he was ninetynine percent certain the earth was warmer then than it had ever been measured to be there was a clear cause and effect relationship with the greenhouse effect and lastly that due to global warming the likelihood of freak weather was steadily increasing with the  eruption of mount pinatubo  saw a cooling in the global temperatures there was speculation that this would cause the next couple years to be cooler because of the large serial correlation in the global temperatures bassett and lin found the statistical odds of a new temperature record to be small hansen countered by saying that having insider information shifts the odds to those who know the physics of the climate system and that whether there is a new temperature record depends upon the particular data set used the temperature data was updated in  to report that  was the warmest year since the instrumental data began in  they also found that the rate of temperature change was larger than at any time in instrument history and conclude that the recent el niño was not totally responsible for the large temperature anomaly in  in spite of this the united states had seen a smaller degree of warming and a region in the eastern us and the western atlantic ocean had actually cooled slightly  saw a major update to how the temperature was calculated it incorporated corrections due to the following reasons timeofobservation bias station history changes classification of ruralurban station the urban adjustment based on satellite measurements of night light intensity and relying more on rural station than urban evidence was found of local urban warming in urban suburban and smalltown records the anomalously high global temperature in  due to el niño resulted in a brief drop in subsequent years however a  hansen report in the journal science states that global warming continues and that the increasing temperatures should stimulate discussions on how to slow global warming the temperature data was updated in  to report that temperatures are now  °c warmer than a century ago and conclude that the recent global warming is a real climate change and not an artifact from the urban heat island effect the regional variation of warming with more warming in the higher latitudes is further evidence of warming that is anthropogenic in origin in  stephen mcintyre notified giss that many of the us temperature records from the historical climatology network ushcn displayed a discontinuity around the year  nasa corrected the computer code used to process the data and credited mcintyre with pointing out the flaw hansen indicated that he felt that several news organizations had overreacted to this mistake in  hansen published a paper entitled global surface temperature change describing current global temperature analysis black carbon studiesedit the incomplete combustion of biomass during the yellowstone fires of  near the snake river introduced a large quantity of black carbon particles into the atmosphere hansen has also contributed toward the understanding of black carbon on regional climate in recent decades northern china has experienced increased drought and southern china has received increased summer rain resulting in a larger number of floods southern china has had a decrease in temperatures while most of the world has warmed in a paper with menon and colleagues through the use of observations and climate models results they conclude that the black carbon heats the air increases convection and precipitation and leads to larger surface cooling than if the aerosols were sulfates a year later hansen teamed with makiko sato to publish a study on black carbon using the global network of aeronet sun photometers while the location of the aeronet instruments did not represent a global sample they could still be used to validate global aerosol climatologies they found that most aerosol climatologies underestimated the amount of black carbon by a factor of at least  this corresponds to an increase in the climate forcing of around  wm which they hypothesize is partially offset by the cooling of nonabsorbing aerosols estimations of trends in black carbon emissions show that there was a rapid increase in the s after the start of the industrial revolution and a leveling off from – as environmental laws were enacted china and india have recently increased their emissions of black carbon corresponding to their rapid development the emissions from the united kingdom were estimated using a network of stations that measured black smoke and sulfur dioxide they report that atmospheric black carbon concentrations have been decreasing since the beginning of the record in the s and that the decline was faster than the decline in blackcarbonproducing fuel use a  paper used the giss climate model in an attempt to determine the origin of black carbon in the arctic much of the arctic aerosol comes from south asia countries such as the united states and russia have a lower contribution than previously assumed anthropogenic impact on climateedit hansen has warned that lowlying coastal areas such as florida seen here east anglia the netherlands oceanic islands and bangladesh are vulnerable to sea levels rising the united nations framework convention on climate change is an international environmental treaty that has the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system in  hansen wrote a paper called can we defuse the global warming time bomb in which he argued that humancaused forces on the climate are now greater than natural ones and that this over a long time period can cause large climate changes he further states that a lower limit on “dangerous anthropogenic interference” is set by the stability of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets his view on actions to mitigate climate change is that halting global warming requires urgent unprecedented international cooperation but the needed actions are feasible and have additional benefits for human health agriculture and the environment in a  presentation at the university of iowa hansen announced that he was told by highranking government officials not to talk about how anthropogenic influence could have a dangerous effect on climate because its not understood what dangerous means or how humans are actually affecting climate he describes this as a faustian bargain because atmospheric aerosols have health risks and should be reduced but doing so will effectively increase the warming effects from co hansen and coauthors propose that the global mean temperature is a good tool to diagnose dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system two elements are particularly important when discussing dangerous anthropogenic interference sea level rise and the extinction of species they describe a businessasusual scenario which has greenhouse gases growing at approximately  per year and an alternate scenario in which greenhouse gases concentrations decline under the alternate scenario sea levels could rise by  meter per century causing problems due to the dense population in coastal areas but this would be minor compared to the meter increase in sea level under the businessasusual scenario hansen describes the situation with species extinction similarly to that of sea level rise assuming the alternate scenario the situation is not good but it is much worse for business as usual the concept of dangerous anthropogenic interference was clarified in a  paper finding that further warming of  °c would be highly disruptive to humans an alternate scenario would keep the warming to below this if climate sensitivity were below  °c for doubled co the conclusion is that co levels above  ppm are considered dangerous but that reduction in nonco greenhouse gases can provide temporary relief from drastic co cuts further findings are that arctic climate change has been forced by nonco constituents as much as by co the  paper cautions that prompt action is needed to slow co growth and to prevent a dangerous anthropogenic interference climate model development and projectionsedit a comparison of global surface temperature computed for three scenarios and compared with two analysis of observational data vilhelm bjerknes began the modern development of the general circulation model in the early th century the progress of numerical modeling was slow due to the slow speed of early computers and the lack of adequate observations it wasnt until the s that the numerical models were getting close to being realistic hansens first contribution to numerical climate models came with the  publication of the giss model he and his colleagues claimed that the model was successful in simulating the major features of sealevel pressure and mb heights in the north american region a  science publication by hansen and a team of scientists at goddard concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to warming sooner than previously predicted they used a onedimensional radiativeconvective model that calculates temperature as a function of height they reported that the results from the d model are similar to those of the more complex d models and can simulate basic mechanisms and feedbacks hansen predicted that temperatures would rise out of the climate noise by the s much earlier than predicted by other researches he also predicted that it would be difficult to convince politicians and the public to react by the early s the computational speed of computers along with refinements in climate models allowed longer experiments the models now included physics beyond the previous equations such as convection schemes diurnal changes and snowdepth calculations the advances in computational efficiency combined with the added physics meant the giss model i could be run for five years it was shown that global climate can be simulated reasonably well with a gridpoint resolution as coarse as  kilometers the first climate prediction computed from a general circulation model that was published by hansen was in  the same year as his wellknown senate testimony the second generation of the giss model was used to estimate the change in mean surface temperature based on a variety of scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions hansen concluded that global warming would be evident within the next few decades and that it would result in temperatures at least as high as during the eemian he argued that if the temperature rises  °c above the – mean for a few years it is the smoking gun pointing to humancaused global warming hansen giving testimony before the united states congress in  in  hansen and colleagues compared the observations with the projections made by hansen in his  testimony before the united states congress they described the intermediate scenario as the most likely and that realworld greenhouse gas forcing has been closest to this scenario it contained the effects of three volcanic eruptions in the fiftyyear projections with one in the  whereas the recent mount pinatubo eruption was in  they found that the observed warming was similar to two of the three scenarios the warming rates of the two most modest warming scenarios are nearly the same through the year  and they were unable to provide a precise model assessment they did note that the agreement between the observations and the intermediate scenario was accidental because the climate sensitivity used was higher than current estimates a year later hansen joined with rahmstorf and colleagues comparing climate projections with observations the comparison is done from  through january  against physicsbased models that are independent from the observations after  they show that the climate system may be responding faster than the models indicate rahmstorf and coauthors show concern that sea levels are rising at the high range of the ipcc projections and that it is due to thermal expansion and not from melting of the greenland or antarctic ice sheets following the launch of spacecraft capable of determining temperatures roy spencer and john christy published the first version of their satellite temperature measurements in  contrary to climate models and surface measurements their results showed a cooling in the troposphere however in  wentz and schabel determined that orbital decay had an effect on the derived temperatures hansen compared the corrected troposphere temperatures with the results of the published giss model and concluded that the model is in good agreement with the observations noting that the satellite temperature data had been the last holdout of global warming denialists and that the correction of the data would result in a change from discussing whether global warming is occurring to what is the rate of global warming and what should be done about it hansen has continued the development and diagnostics of climate models for instance he has helped look at the decadal trends in tropopause height which could be a useful tool for determining the human fingerprint on climate as of  february update the current version of the giss model is model e this version has seen improvements in many areas including upperlevel winds cloud height and precipitation this model still has problems with regions of marine stratocumulus clouds a later paper showed that the models main problems are having too weak of an ensolike variability and poor sea ice modeling resulting in too little ice in the southern hemisphere and too much in the northern hemisphere climate forcings feedbacks and sensitivityedit estimated climate forcings between  and  in  hansen authored a paper called global warming in the twentyfirst century an alternative scenario in which he presented a more optimistic way of dealing with global warming focusing on nonco gases and black carbon in the short run giving more time to make reductions in fossil fuel emissions he notes that the net warming observed to date is roughly as big as that expected from nonco gases only this is because co warming is offset by climatecooling aerosols emitted with fossil fuel burning and because at that time nonco gases taken together were responsible for roughly  of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming in a  paper hansen discussed the potential danger of fastfeedback effects causing ice sheet disintegration based on paleoclimate data george monbiot reports the ipcc predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as  centimetres  ft this century hansen’s paper argues that the slow melting of ice sheets the panel expects doesn’t fit the data the geological record suggests that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion but flips suddenly from one state to another when temperatures increased to –°c –°f above today’s level  million years ago sea levels rose not by  centimeters but by  metres  ft the ice responded immediately to changes in temperature hansen stressed the uncertainties around these predictions it is difficult to predict time of collapse in such a nonlinear problem … an ice sheet response time of centuries seems probable and we cannot rule out large changes on decadal timescales once widescale surface melt is underway he concludes that present knowledge does not permit accurate specification of the dangerous level of humanmade greehouse gases however it is much lower than has commonly been assumed if we have not already passed the dangerous level the energy infrastructure in place ensures that we will pass it within several decades in  hansen authored a paper called climate sensitivity sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide in which he estimated climate sensitivity to be ± °c based on pleistocene paleoclimate data the paper also concluded that burning all fossil fuels would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans analysis of climate change causationedit the first action that people should take is to use the democratic process what is frustrating people me included is that democratic action affects elections but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash james hansen march  hansen noted that in determining responsibility for climate change the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate is determined not by current emissions but by accumulated emissions over the lifetime of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by this measure the uk is still the largest single cause of climate change followed by the us and germany even though its current emissions are surpassed by the peoples republic of china on public policy hansen is critical of what he sees as efforts to mislead the public on the issue of climate change he points specifically to the competitive enterprise institutes commercials with the tagline carbon dioxide—they call it pollution we call it life and politicians who accept money from fossilfuel interests and then describe global warming as a great hoax he also says that changes needed to reduce global warming do not require hardship or reduction in the quality of life but will also produce benefits such as cleaner air and water and growth of hightech industries he was a critic of both the clinton and george w bush administrations stances on climate change addressing the potential effects of climate change hansen has stated in an interview in january  we cannot now afford to put off change any longer we have to get on a new path within this new administration we have only four years left for obama to set an example to the rest of the world america must take the lead climate change activismedit us senate committee testimonyedit hansen was invited to testify before the united states senate committee on energy and natural resources on june   hansen testified that global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warmingit is already happening now and the greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate nowwe already reached the point where the greenhouse effect is important hansen said that nasa was  confident that the warming was caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and not a random fluctuation according to science historian spencer r weart hansens testimony increased public awareness of climate change according to richard besel of california polytechnic state university hansens testimony was an important turning point in the history of global climate change according to timothy m odonnell of the university of mary washington hansens testimony was pivotal ignited public discussion of global warming and moved the controversy from a largely scientific discussion to a full blown science policy debate and marked the official beginning of the global warming policy debate according to roger a pielke of the national center for atmospheric research hansens call to action elevated the subject of global warming and the specter of associated impacts such as more hurricanes floods and heat waves to unprecedented levels of attention from the public media and policy makers criticism of coal industryedit hansen has been particularly critical of the coal industry stating that coal contributes the largest percentage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere he acknowledges that a molecule of carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal has the same effect as a molecule emitted from burning oil the difference is where the fuel originally resides he says that most oil comes from russia and saudi arabia and that no matter how fuelefficient automobiles become the oil will eventually be burned and the co emitted in a  testimony before the iowa utilities board he stated that the united states has a large reservoir of coal which makes it a resource that can be controlled through action by us politicians unlike oil which is controlled by other countries he has called for phasing out coal power completely by the year  during his testimony before the iowa utilities board in  hansen likened coal trains to death trains and asserted that these would be no less gruesome than if they were boxcars headed to crematoria loaded with uncountable irreplaceable species in response the national mining association stated that his comparison trivialized the suffering of millions and undermined his credibility citing the reactions of several people and three of his scientific colleagues as his primary motivation hansen stated that he certainly did not mean to trivialize suffering by the families who lost relatives in the holocaust and then apologized saying he regretted that his words caused pain to some readers mountaintop removal miningedit james hansen arrested at a demonstration outside the white house august   on june   james hansen along with  other protesters including actress daryl hannah was arrested on misdemeanor charges of obstructing police and impeding traffic during a protest against mountaintop removal mining in raleigh county west virginia the protesters intended to enter the property of massey energy company but were blocked by a crowd of several hundred coal miners and supporters hansen said that mountaintop removal for coal mining provides only a small fraction of our energy and should be abolished hansen called on president barack obama to abolish mountaintop coal mining hansen and about  other people were arrested in september  in front of the white house in washington dc the group was seeking a ban on mountaintop removal or surface mining cap and tradeedit in  hansen spoke out against cap and trade advocating instead what he believes would be a progressive carbon tax at source carbon as oil gas or coal with a  dividend returned to citizens in equal shares as proposed by citizens climate lobby he has made many appearances and talks supporting the work of ccl retirement from nasaedit hansen retired from nasa in april  after  years of government service saying he planned to take a more active role in the political and legal efforts to limit greenhouse gases he also stated that he could not sue the government as one of its employees the same month the national center for science education an organization noted for defending the teaching of evolution in united states science classrooms named hansen as an advisor to support the extension of its area of concern into the teaching of climate change keystone pipelineedit in a cbc interview aired in april  as canadian natural resources minister joe oliver lobbied in washington dc for approval of keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca oil sands to the gulf of mexico hansen forcefully argued against the use of these unconventional fossil fuels according to intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and other energy organizations there is more than twice as much carbon in the tar sands oil than in conventional oil hansen argued that coal tar sands and tar shale should not be used as energy sources because of their carbon emissions and claimed that the completion of the keystone pipeline would increase the extraction of oil from oil sands he explained that the effects of climate change may not be apparent until the far future its not the case where you emit something and you see the effect we see the beginnings of the effect but the large impacts are going to be in future decades and that science is crystal clear … effects come slowly because of the inertia of the climate system it takes decades even centuries to get the full response but we know the last time the world was  degrees warmer sea level was  meters or  feet higher hansen urged president obama to reject the keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca oil sands to the gulf of mexico on february   hansen was again arrested at the white house along with daryl hannah and robert f kennedy jr during a further protest against the proposed keystone pipeline extension proposed solutionsedit most recently hansen has stated his support for a revenueneutral fee and dividend system to impose a price on carbon that returns the money collected from the fossil fuel industry equally to all legal residents of the united states in an interview on cbc television on march   dr hansen stated the solution to climate change has to be a rising price on carbon and then the really dirty fuels like tar sands would fall on the table very quickly they make no sense at all if you look at it from an economicwide perspective if we would simply put a fee on carbon – you would collect from the fossil fuel companies at the source the domestic mines or the ports of entry and then distribute that money to the public an equal amount to all legal residents that would begin to make the prices honest and thats what the economy needs in order to be most efficient right now the external costs of fossil fuels are borne completely by the public if your child gets asthma you pay the bill the fossil fuel company doesnt what we need is to make the system honest at the end of  hansen stated five priorities that he felt then presidentelect obama should adopt for solving the climate and energy problems while stimulating the economy efficient energy use renewable energy a smart grid generation iv nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage regarding nuclear he expressed opposition to the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository stating that the  billion us surplus held in the nuclear waste fund should be used to develop fast reactors that consume nuclear waste and thorium reactors to prevent the creation of new longlived nuclear waste in  hansen wrote an open letter to president barack obama where he advocated a moratorium and phaseout of coal plants that do not capture and store co in his first book storms of my grandchildren similarly hansen discusses his declaration of stewardship the first principle of which requires a moratorium on coalfired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide in march  james hansen coauthored a paper in environmental science  technology entitled prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power the paper examined mortality levels per unit of electrical power produced from fossil fuels coal and natural gas as well as nuclear power it estimated that  million lives were saved worldwide between  and  through the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels hansen also concluded that the emission of some  billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were avoided by nuclear power use between  and  looking to the future between  and  it was estimated that nuclear could additionally avoid up to  to  billion tonnes this paper elicited a critical response to hansens analysis from an international group of senior academic energy policy analysts including benjamin sovacool mv ramana mark z jacobson and mark diesendorf they said nuclear power needs large subsidies to be economically viable and typically there are substantial construction delays and cost overruns associated with nuclear plants sovacool et al say that hansen and kharechas estimates of chernobyl disaster mortalities is very low which biases their conclusions all of these factors are said to make hansens article incomplete and misleading hansen and his initial coauthor then countered each of their attempts at rebutting his paper and argued that all the data these scientists use to make their criticism lacks credibility in  with three other leading experts hansen was coauthor of an open letter to policy makers which stated that continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanitys ability to avoid dangerous climate change the reaction from antinuclear environmental groups eg the natural resources defense council sierra club and greenpeace was negative citing nuclear safety and security issues and the economics of nuclear power plants in a  article diazmaurin says that one of the main problems with hansens nuclear work is the use of still debated historical records he says that hansen extrapolated shortterm health impacts of nuclear power to longterm projections of climate science in  the world business academy wrote an open letter to hansen questioning his advocacy of nuclear energy honors and awardsedit hansen was elected to the national academy of sciences in  for his development of pioneering radiative transfer models and studies of planetary atmospheres development of simplified and threedimensional global climate models explication of climate forcing mechanisms analysis of current climate trends from observational data and projections of anthropogenic impacts on the global climate system in  he received the th annual heinz award in the environment endowed with us for his research on global warming and was listed as one of time magazines  most influential people in  also in  the american association for the advancement of science aaas selected james hansen to receive its award for scientific freedom and responsibility for his courageous and steadfast advocacy in support of scientists responsibilities to communicate their scientific opinions and findings openly and honestly on matters of public importance in  hansen shared the us million dan david prize for achievements having an outstanding scientific technological cultural or social impact on our world in  he received the pnc bank common wealth award of distinguished service for his outstanding achievements in science at the end of  hansen was named by earthsky communications and a panel of  scientistadvisors as the scientist communicator of the year citing him as an outspoken authority on climate change who had best communicated with the public about vital science issues or concepts during  in  hansen was awarded the  carlgustaf rossby research medal the highest honor bestowed by the american meteorological society for his outstanding contributions to climate modeling understanding climate change forcings and sensitivity and for clear communication of climate science in the public arena hansen won the  sophie prize set up in  by norwegian jostein gaarder the author of the  bestselling novel and teenagers guide to philosophy sophies world for his  key role for the development of our understanding of humaninduced climate change foreign policy named hansen one of its  fp top  global thinkers for sounding the alarm on climate change early and often in december  hansen received the commonwealth club of california’s annual stephen h schneider award for outstanding climate science communications at a ceremony in san francisco on november   hansen received the joseph priestley award at dickinson college in carlisle pennsylvania for his work advancing our understanding of climate change including the early application of numerical models to better understand observed climate trends and to project humans impact on climate and for his leadership in promoting public understanding of climate and linking the knowledge to action on climate policy he delivered a lecture entitled white house arrest and the climate crisis later that same day at anita tuvin schlechter auditorium on the colleges campus james hansen is cowinner with climatologist syukuro manabe of the bbva foundation frontiers of knowledge award in the climate change category in this ninth edition  of the awards the two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior decades ago they correctly predicted how much earth’s temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric co the scores of models currently in use to chart climate evolution are heirs to those developed by manabe and hansen controversiesedit political interference at nasaedit in  hansen alleged that in  nasa administrators had attempted to influence his public statements about the causes of climate change hansen said that nasa public relations staff were ordered to review his public statements and interviews after a december  lecture at the american geophysical union in san francisco nasa responded that its policies are similar to those of any other federal agency in requiring employees to coordinate all statements with the public affairs office without exception two years after hansen and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political appointees the agency’s inspector general confirmed that such activities had taken place with the nasa office of public affairs having reduced marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public in june  hansen appeared on  minutes stating that the george w bush white house had edited climaterelated press releases reported by federal agencies to make global warming seem less threatening he also stated that he was unable to speak freely without the backlash of other government officials and that he had not experienced that level of restrictions on communicating with the public during his career trials for energy company executivesedit in  interviews with abc news the guardian and in a separate oped hansen has called for putting fossil fuel company executives including the ceos of exxonmobil and peabody coal on trial for high crimes against humanity and nature on the grounds that these and other fossilfuel companies had actively spread doubt and misinformation about global warming in the same way that tobacco companies tried to hide the link between smoking and cancer arrest for protest demonstrationedit hansen and  other activists were arrested in august and september  at another demonstration in front of the white house hansen urged president obama to reject the keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca tar sands to the gulf of mexico on february   hansen was again arrested at the white house along with daryl hannah and robert f kennedy jr during a further protest against the proposed keystone pipeline extension criticismedit this articles criticism or controversy section may compromise the articles neutral point of view of the subject please integrate the sections contents into the article as a whole or rewrite the material december  in january  andrew freedman wrote in the washington post that the american meteorological society had erred in giving hansen its carlgustaf rossby research medal his body of work is not at issue rather the problem arises due to the ams recognition of hansens public communication work on climate change former ams member joseph daleo a skeptic of humancaused climate change also criticized the award also in  physicist freeman dyson criticised hansens climatechange activism the person who is really responsible for this overestimate of global warming is jim hansen he consistently exaggerates all the dangers hansen has turned his science into ideology hansen responded that if dyson is going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet then he should first do his homework dyson stated in an interview that the argument with hansen was exaggerated by the new york times stating that he and hansen are friends but we dont agree on everything after hansens arrest in  in west virginia new york times columnist andrew revkin wrote dr hansen has pushed far beyond the boundaries of the conventional role of scientists particularly government scientists in the environmental policy debate in june  new yorker journalist elizabeth kolbert wrote that hansen is increasingly isolated among climate activists eileen claussen president of the pew center on global climate change said that i view jim hansen as heroic as a scientist but i wish he would stick to what he really knows because i dont think he has a realistic idea of what is politically possible or what the best policies would be to deal with this problem in july  new york times climate columnist christa marshall asked if hansen still matters in the ongoing climate debate noting that he has irked many longtime supporters with his scathing attacks against president obamas plan for a capandtrade system the right wing loves what hes doing said joseph romm a senior fellow at the center for american progress a think tank hansen said that he had to speak out since few others could explain the links between politics and the climate models you just have to say what you think is right he said publicationsedit hansen james e  storms of my grandchildren the truth about the coming climate catastrophe and our last

professor in the department of earth and environmental sciences at columbia university he is best known for his research in climatology his  congressional testimony on climate change that helped raise broad awareness of global warming and his advocacy of action to avoid dangerous climate change in recent years he has become a climate activist to mitigate the effects of climate change on a few occasions leading to his arrest in  hansen advanced an alternative view of global warming over the last  years arguing that during that time frame the negative forcing via aerosols and the positive forcing via co largely balanced each other out and that the ± °c net rise in average global temperatures could mostly be explained by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons however even then he wrote the future balance of forcings is likely to shift toward dominance of co over aerosols contents  early life and education  career  research and

in the space science program of james van allen at the university of iowa he obtained a ba in physics and mathematics with highest distinction in  an ms in astronomy in  and a phd in physics in  all three degrees from the university of iowa he participated in the nasa graduate traineeship from  to  and at the same time between  and  he was a visiting student at the institute of astrophysics at the university of kyoto and in the department of astronomy at the university of tokyo hansen then began work at the goddard institute for space studies in  careeredit after graduate school hansen continued his work with radiative transfer models attempting to understand the venusian atmosphere later he applied and refined these models to understand the earths atmosphere in particular the effects that aerosols and trace gases have on earths climate hansens development and use of global climate models has contributed to the further understanding of the earths climate in  his first book storms of my grandchildren was published in  he presented a  ted talk why i must speak out about climate change from  to  he was the head of the nasa goddard institute for space studies in new york city a part of the goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland as of update hansen directs the program on climate science awareness and solutions at columbia universitys earth institute the program is working to continue to connect the dots from advancing basic climate science to promoting public awareness to advocating policy actions research and publicationsedit as a college student at the university of iowa hansen was attracted to science and the research done by james van allens space science program in the physics and astronomy department a decade later his focus shifted to planetary research that involved trying to understand the climate change on earth that will result from anthropogenic changes of the atmospheric composition hansen has stated that one of his research interests is radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres especially the interpretation of remote sensing of the earths atmosphere and surface from satellites because of the ability of satellites to monitor the entire globe they may be one of the most effective ways to monitor and study global change his other interests include the development of global circulation models to help understand the observed climate trends and diagnosing human impacts on climate studies of venusedit venus is surrounded by a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen and its clouds are sulfuric acid the thickness of the atmosphere initially made it difficult to determine why the surface was so hot in the late s and early s following his phd dissertation hansen published several papers on the planet venus venus has a high brightness temperature in the radio frequencies compared to the infrared hansen proposed that the hot surface was the result of aerosols trapping the internal energy of the planet more recent studies have suggested that several billion years ago venuss atmosphere was much more like earths than it is now and that there were probably substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface but a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere hansen continued his study of venus by looking at the composition of its clouds he looked at the nearinfrared reflectivity of ice clouds compared them to observations of venus and found that they qualitatively agreed he also was able to use a radiative transfer model to establish an upper limit to the size of the ice particles if the clouds were actually made of ice evidence published in the early s showed that the clouds consist mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets by  the composition of venus clouds had not yet been determined with many scientists proposing a wide variety of compounds including liquid water and aqueous solutions of ferrous chloride hansen and hovenier used the polarization of sunlight reflected from the planet to establish that the clouds were spherical and had a refractive index and cloud drop effective radius which eliminated all of the proposed cloud types except sulfuric acid kiyoshi kawabata and hansen expanded upon this work by looking at the variation of polarization on venus they found that the visible clouds are a diffuse haze rather than a thick cloud confirming the same results obtained from transits across the sun the pioneer venus project was launched in may  and reached venus late that same year hansen collaborated with larry travis and other colleagues in a  science article that reported on the development and variability of clouds in the ultraviolet spectrum they conclude that there are at least three different cloud materials that contribute to the images a thin haze layer sulfuric acid clouds and an unknown ultraviolet absorber below the sulfuric acid cloud layer the linear polarization data obtained from the same mission confirmed that the low and midlevel clouds were sulfuric acid with radius of about  micrometer above the cloud layer was a layer of submicrometre haze global temperature analysisedit a typical automated airport weather station which records the routine hourly weather observations of temperature weather type wind sky condition and visibility these surface stations are located around the world and are used to derive a global temperature the first giss nasa goddard institute for space studies global temperature analysis was published in  hansen and his coauthor analyzed the surface air temperature at meteorological stations focusing on the years from  to  temperatures for stations closer together than  kilometers were shown to be highly correlated especially in the midlatitudes providing a way to combine the station data to provide accurate longterm variations they conclude that global mean temperatures can be determined even though meteorological stations are typically in the northern hemisphere and confined to continental regions warming in the past century was found to be  °c with warming similar in both hemispheres when the analysis was updated in  the four warmest years on record were all in the s the two warmest years were  and  during a senate meeting on june rd  hansen reported that he was ninetynine percent certain the earth was warmer then than it had ever been measured to be there was a clear cause and effect relationship with the greenhouse effect and lastly that due to global warming the likelihood of freak weather was steadily increasing with the  eruption of mount pinatubo  saw a cooling in the global temperatures there was speculation that this would cause the next couple years to be cooler because of the large serial correlation in the global temperatures bassett and lin found the statistical odds of a new temperature record to be small hansen countered by saying that having insider information shifts the odds to those who know the physics of the climate system and that whether there is a new temperature record depends upon the particular data set used the temperature data was updated in  to report that  was the warmest year since the instrumental data began in  they also found that the rate of temperature change was larger than at any time in instrument history and conclude that the recent el niño was not totally responsible for the large temperature anomaly in  in spite of this the united states had seen a smaller degree of warming and a region in the eastern us and the western atlantic ocean had actually cooled slightly  saw a major update to how the temperature was calculated it incorporated corrections due to the following reasons timeofobservation bias station history changes classification of ruralurban station the urban adjustment based on satellite measurements of night light intensity and relying more on rural station than urban evidence was found of local urban warming in urban suburban and smalltown records the anomalously high global temperature in  due to el niño resulted in a brief drop in subsequent years however a  hansen report in the journal science states that global warming continues and that the increasing temperatures should stimulate discussions on how to slow global warming the temperature data was updated in  to report that temperatures are now  °c warmer than a century ago and conclude that the recent global warming is a real climate change and not an artifact from the urban heat island effect the regional variation of warming with more warming in the higher latitudes is further evidence of warming that is anthropogenic in origin in  stephen mcintyre notified giss that many of the us temperature records from the historical climatology network ushcn displayed a discontinuity around the year  nasa corrected the computer code used to process the data and credited mcintyre with pointing out the flaw hansen indicated that he felt that several news organizations had overreacted to this mistake in  hansen published a paper entitled global surface temperature change describing current global temperature analysis black carbon studiesedit the incomplete combustion of biomass during the yellowstone fires of  near the snake river introduced a large quantity of black carbon particles into the atmosphere hansen has also contributed toward the understanding of black carbon on regional climate in recent decades northern china has experienced increased drought and southern china has received increased summer rain resulting in a larger number of floods southern china has had a decrease in temperatures while most of the world has warmed in a paper with menon and colleagues through the use of observations and climate models results they conclude that the black carbon heats the air increases convection and precipitation and leads to larger surface cooling than if the aerosols were sulfates a year later hansen teamed with makiko sato to publish a study on black carbon using the global network of aeronet sun photometers while the location of the aeronet instruments did not represent a global sample they could still be used to validate global aerosol climatologies they found that most aerosol climatologies underestimated the amount of black carbon by a factor of at least  this corresponds to an increase in the climate forcing of around  wm which they hypothesize is partially offset by the cooling of nonabsorbing aerosols estimations of trends in black carbon emissions show that there was a rapid increase in the s after the start of the industrial revolution and a leveling off from – as environmental laws were enacted china and india have recently increased their emissions of black carbon corresponding to their rapid development the emissions from the united kingdom were estimated using a network of stations that measured black smoke and sulfur dioxide they report that atmospheric black carbon concentrations have been decreasing since the beginning of the record in the s and that the decline was faster than the decline in blackcarbonproducing fuel use a  paper used the giss climate model in an attempt to determine the origin of black carbon in the arctic much of the arctic aerosol comes from south asia countries such as the united states and russia have a lower contribution than previously assumed anthropogenic impact on climateedit hansen has warned that lowlying coastal areas such as florida seen here east anglia the netherlands oceanic islands and bangladesh are vulnerable to sea levels rising the united nations framework convention on climate change is an international environmental treaty that has the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system in  hansen wrote a paper called can we defuse the global warming time bomb in which he argued that humancaused forces on the climate are now greater than natural ones and that this over a long time period can cause large climate changes he further states that a lower limit on “dangerous anthropogenic interference” is set by the stability of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets his view on actions to mitigate climate change is that halting global warming requires urgent unprecedented international cooperation but the needed actions are feasible and have additional benefits for human health agriculture and the environment in a  presentation at the university of iowa hansen announced that he was told by highranking government officials not to talk about how anthropogenic influence could have a dangerous effect on climate because its not understood what dangerous means or how humans are actually affecting climate he describes this as a faustian bargain because atmospheric aerosols have health risks and should be reduced but doing so will effectively increase the warming effects from co hansen and coauthors propose that the global mean temperature is a good tool to diagnose dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system two elements are particularly important when discussing dangerous anthropogenic interference sea level rise and the extinction of species they describe a businessasusual scenario which has greenhouse gases growing at approximately  per year and an alternate scenario in which greenhouse gases concentrations decline under the alternate scenario sea levels could rise by  meter per century causing problems due to the dense population in coastal areas but this would be minor compared to the meter increase in sea level under the businessasusual scenario hansen describes the situation with species extinction similarly to that of sea level rise assuming the alternate scenario the situation is not good but it is much worse for business as usual the concept of dangerous anthropogenic interference was clarified in a  paper finding that further warming of  °c would be highly disruptive to humans an alternate scenario would keep the warming to below this if climate sensitivity were below  °c for doubled co the conclusion is that co levels above  ppm are considered dangerous but that reduction in nonco greenhouse gases can provide temporary relief from drastic co cuts further findings are that arctic climate change has been forced by nonco constituents as much as by co the  paper cautions that prompt action is needed to slow co growth and to prevent a dangerous anthropogenic interference climate model development and projectionsedit a comparison of global surface temperature computed for three scenarios and compared with two analysis of observational data vilhelm bjerknes began the modern development of the general circulation model in the early th century the progress of numerical modeling was slow due to the slow speed of early computers and the lack of adequate observations it wasnt until the s that the numerical models were getting close to being realistic hansens first contribution to numerical climate models came with the  publication of the giss model he and his colleagues claimed that the model was successful in simulating the major features of sealevel pressure and mb heights in the north american region a  science publication by hansen and a team of scientists at goddard concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to warming sooner than previously predicted they used a onedimensional radiativeconvective model that calculates temperature as a function of height they reported that the results from the d model are similar to those of the more complex d models and can simulate basic mechanisms and feedbacks hansen predicted that temperatures would rise out of the climate noise by the s much earlier than predicted by other researches he also predicted that it would be difficult to convince politicians and the public to react by the early s the computational speed of computers along with refinements in climate models allowed longer experiments the models now included physics beyond the previous equations such as convection schemes diurnal changes and snowdepth calculations the advances in computational efficiency combined with the added physics meant the giss model i could be run for five years it was shown that global climate can be simulated reasonably well with a gridpoint resolution as coarse as  kilometers the first climate prediction computed from a general circulation model that was published by hansen was in  the same year as his wellknown senate testimony the second generation of the giss model was used to estimate the change in mean surface temperature based on a variety of scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions hansen concluded that global warming would be evident within the next few decades and that it would result in temperatures at least as high as during the eemian he argued that if the temperature rises  °c above the – mean for a few years it is the smoking gun pointing to humancaused global warming hansen giving testimony before the united states congress in  in  hansen and colleagues compared the observations with the projections made by hansen in his  testimony before the united states congress they described the intermediate scenario as the most likely and that realworld greenhouse gas forcing has been closest to this scenario it contained the effects of three volcanic eruptions in the fiftyyear projections with one in the  whereas the recent mount pinatubo eruption was in  they found that the observed warming was similar to two of the three scenarios the warming rates of the two most modest warming scenarios are nearly the same through the year  and they were unable to provide a precise model assessment they did note that the agreement between the observations and the intermediate scenario was accidental because the climate sensitivity used was higher than current estimates a year later hansen joined with rahmstorf and colleagues comparing climate projections with observations the comparison is done from  through january  against physicsbased models that are independent from the observations after  they show that the climate system may be responding faster than the models indicate rahmstorf and coauthors show concern that sea levels are rising at the high range of the ipcc projections and that it is due to thermal expansion and not from melting of the greenland or antarctic ice sheets following the launch of spacecraft capable of determining temperatures roy spencer and john christy published the first version of their satellite temperature measurements in  contrary to climate models and surface measurements their results showed a cooling in the troposphere however in  wentz and schabel determined that orbital decay had an effect on the derived temperatures hansen compared the corrected troposphere temperatures with the results of the published giss model and concluded that the model is in good agreement with the observations noting that the satellite temperature data had been the last holdout of global warming denialists and that the correction of the data would result in a change from discussing whether global warming is occurring to what is the rate of global warming and what should be done about it hansen has continued the development and diagnostics of climate models for instance he has helped look at the decadal trends in tropopause height which could be a useful tool for determining the human fingerprint on climate as of  february update the current version of the giss model is model e this version has seen improvements in many areas including upperlevel winds cloud height and precipitation this model still has problems with regions of marine stratocumulus clouds a later paper showed that the models main problems are having too weak of an ensolike variability and poor sea ice modeling resulting in too little ice in the southern hemisphere and too much in the northern hemisphere climate forcings feedbacks and sensitivityedit estimated climate forcings between  and  in  hansen authored a paper called global warming in the twentyfirst century an alternative scenario in which he presented a more optimistic way of dealing with global warming focusing on nonco gases and black carbon in the short run giving more time to make reductions in fossil fuel emissions he notes that the net warming observed to date is roughly as big as that expected from nonco gases only this is because co warming is offset by climatecooling aerosols emitted with fossil fuel burning and because at that time nonco gases taken together were responsible for roughly  of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming in a  paper hansen discussed the potential danger of fastfeedback effects causing ice sheet disintegration based on paleoclimate data george monbiot reports the ipcc predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as  centimetres  ft this century hansen’s paper argues that the slow melting of ice sheets the panel expects doesn’t fit the data the geological record suggests that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion but flips suddenly from one state to another when temperatures increased to –°c –°f above today’s level  million years ago sea levels rose not by  centimeters but by  metres  ft the ice responded immediately to changes in temperature hansen stressed the uncertainties around these predictions it is difficult to predict time of collapse in such a nonlinear problem … an ice sheet response time of centuries seems probable and we cannot rule out large changes on decadal timescales once widescale surface melt is underway he concludes that present knowledge does not permit accurate specification of the dangerous level of humanmade greehouse gases however it is much lower than has commonly been assumed if we have not already passed the dangerous level the energy infrastructure in place ensures that we will pass it within several decades in  hansen authored a paper called climate sensitivity sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide in which he estimated climate sensitivity to be ± °c based on pleistocene paleoclimate data the paper also concluded that burning all fossil fuels would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans analysis of climate change causationedit the first action that people should take is to use the democratic process what is frustrating people me included is that democratic action affects elections but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash james hansen march  hansen noted that in determining responsibility for climate change the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate is determined not by current emissions but by accumulated emissions over the lifetime of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by this measure the uk is still the largest single cause of climate change followed by the us and germany even though its current emissions are surpassed by the peoples republic of china on public policy hansen is critical of what he sees as efforts to mislead the public on the issue of climate change he points specifically to the competitive enterprise institutes commercials with the tagline carbon dioxide—they call it pollution we call it life and politicians who accept money from fossilfuel interests and then describe global warming as a great hoax he also says that changes needed to reduce global warming do not require hardship or reduction in the quality of life but will also produce benefits such as cleaner air and water and growth of hightech industries he was a critic of both the clinton and george w bush administrations stances on climate change addressing the potential effects of climate change hansen has stated in an interview in january  we cannot now afford to put off change any longer we have to get on a new path within this new administration we have only four years left for obama to set an example to the rest of the world america must take the lead climate change activismedit us senate committee testimonyedit hansen was invited to testify before the united states senate committee on energy and natural resources on june   hansen testified that global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warmingit is already happening now and the greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate nowwe already reached the point where the greenhouse effect is important hansen said that nasa was  confident that the warming was caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and not a random fluctuation according to science historian spencer r weart hansens testimony increased public awareness of climate change according to richard besel of california polytechnic state university hansens testimony was an important turning point in the history of global climate change according to timothy m odonnell of the university of mary washington hansens testimony was pivotal ignited public discussion of global warming and moved the controversy from a largely scientific discussion to a full blown science policy debate and marked the official beginning of the global warming policy debate according to roger a pielke of the national center for atmospheric research hansens call to action elevated the subject of global warming and the specter of associated impacts such as more hurricanes floods and heat waves to unprecedented levels of attention from the public media and policy makers criticism of coal industryedit hansen has been particularly critical of the coal industry stating that coal contributes the largest percentage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere he acknowledges that a molecule of carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal has the same effect as a molecule emitted from burning oil the difference is where the fuel originally resides he says that most oil comes from russia and saudi arabia and that no matter how fuelefficient automobiles become the oil will eventually be burned and the co emitted in a  testimony before the iowa utilities board he stated that the united states has a large reservoir of coal which makes it a resource that can be controlled through action by us politicians unlike oil which is controlled by other countries he has called for phasing out coal power completely by the year  during his testimony before the iowa utilities board in  hansen likened coal trains to death trains and asserted that these would be no less gruesome than if they were boxcars headed to crematoria loaded with uncountable irreplaceable species in response the national mining association stated that his comparison trivialized the suffering of millions and undermined his credibility citing the reactions of several people and three of his scientific colleagues as his primary motivation hansen stated that he certainly did not mean to trivialize suffering by the families who lost relatives in the holocaust and then apologized saying he regretted that his words caused pain to some readers mountaintop removal miningedit james hansen arrested at a demonstration outside the white house august   on june   james hansen along with  other protesters including actress daryl hannah was arrested on misdemeanor charges of obstructing police and impeding traffic during a protest against mountaintop removal mining in raleigh county west virginia the protesters intended to enter the property of massey energy company but were blocked by a crowd of several hundred coal miners and supporters hansen said that mountaintop removal for coal mining provides only a small fraction of our energy and should be abolished hansen called on president barack obama to abolish mountaintop coal mining hansen and about  other people were arrested in september  in front of the white house in washington dc the group was seeking a ban on mountaintop removal or surface mining cap and tradeedit in  hansen spoke out against cap and trade advocating instead what he believes would be a progressive carbon tax at source carbon as oil gas or coal with a  dividend returned to citizens in equal shares as proposed by citizens climate lobby he has made many appearances and talks supporting the work of ccl retirement from nasaedit hansen retired from nasa in april  after  years of government service saying he planned to take a more active role in the political and legal efforts to limit greenhouse gases he also stated that he could not sue the government as one of its employees the same month the national center for science education an organization noted for defending the teaching of evolution in united states science classrooms named hansen as an advisor to support the extension of its area of concern into the teaching of climate change keystone pipelineedit in a cbc interview aired in april  as canadian natural resources minister joe oliver lobbied in washington dc for approval of keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca oil sands to the gulf of mexico hansen forcefully argued against the use of these unconventional fossil fuels according to intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and other energy organizations there is more than twice as much carbon in the tar sands oil than in conventional oil hansen argued that coal tar sands and tar shale should not be used as energy sources because of their carbon emissions and claimed that the completion of the keystone pipeline would increase the extraction of oil from oil sands he explained that the effects of climate change may not be apparent until the far future its not the case where you emit something and you see the effect we see the beginnings of the effect but the large impacts are going to be in future decades and that science is crystal clear … effects come slowly because of the inertia of the climate system it takes decades even centuries to get the full response but we know the last time the world was  degrees warmer sea level was  meters or  feet higher hansen urged president obama to reject the keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca oil sands to the gulf of mexico on february   hansen was again arrested at the white house along with daryl hannah and robert f kennedy jr during a further protest against the proposed keystone pipeline extension proposed solutionsedit most recently hansen has stated his support for a revenueneutral fee and dividend system to impose a price on carbon that returns the money collected from the fossil fuel industry equally to all legal residents of the united states in an interview on cbc television on march   dr hansen stated the solution to climate change has to be a rising price on carbon and then the really dirty fuels like tar sands would fall on the table very quickly they make no sense at all if you look at it from an economicwide perspective if we would simply put a fee on carbon – you would collect from the fossil fuel companies at the source the domestic mines or the ports of entry and then distribute that money to the public an equal amount to all legal residents that would begin to make the prices honest and thats what the economy needs in order to be most efficient right now the external costs of fossil fuels are borne completely by the public if your child gets asthma you pay the bill the fossil fuel company doesnt what we need is to make the system honest at the end of  hansen stated five priorities that he felt then presidentelect obama should adopt for solving the climate and energy problems while stimulating the economy efficient energy use renewable energy a smart grid generation iv nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage regarding nuclear he expressed opposition to the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository stating that the  billion us surplus held in the nuclear waste fund should be used to develop fast reactors that consume nuclear waste and thorium reactors to prevent the creation of new longlived nuclear waste in  hansen wrote an open letter to president barack obama where he advocated a moratorium and phaseout of coal plants that do not capture and store co in his first book storms of my grandchildren similarly hansen discusses his declaration of stewardship the first principle of which requires a moratorium on coalfired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide in march  james hansen coauthored a paper in environmental science  technology entitled prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power the paper examined mortality levels per unit of electrical power produced from fossil fuels coal and natural gas as well as nuclear power it estimated that  million lives were saved worldwide between  and  through the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels hansen also concluded that the emission of some  billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were avoided by nuclear power use between  and  looking to the future between  and  it was estimated that nuclear could additionally avoid up to  to  billion tonnes this paper elicited a critical response to hansens analysis from an international group of senior academic energy policy analysts including benjamin sovacool mv ramana mark z jacobson and mark diesendorf they said nuclear power needs large subsidies to be economically viable and typically there are substantial construction delays and cost overruns associated with nuclear plants sovacool et al say that hansen and kharechas estimates of chernobyl disaster mortalities is very low which biases their conclusions all of these factors are said to make hansens article incomplete and misleading hansen and his initial coauthor then countered each of their attempts at rebutting his paper and argued that all the data these scientists use to make their criticism lacks credibility in  with three other leading experts hansen was coauthor of an open letter to policy makers which stated that continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanitys ability to avoid dangerous climate change the reaction from antinuclear environmental groups eg the natural resources defense council sierra club and greenpeace was negative citing nuclear safety and security issues and the economics of nuclear power plants in a  article diazmaurin says that one of the main problems with hansens nuclear work is the use of still debated historical records he says that hansen extrapolated shortterm health impacts of nuclear power to longterm projections of climate science in  the world business academy wrote an open letter to hansen questioning his advocacy of nuclear energy honors and awardsedit hansen was elected to the national academy of sciences in  for his development of pioneering radiative transfer models and studies of planetary atmospheres development of simplified and threedimensional global climate models explication of climate forcing mechanisms analysis of current climate trends from observational data and projections of anthropogenic impacts on the global climate system in  he received the th annual heinz award in the environment endowed with us for his research on global warming and was listed as one of time magazines  most influential people in  also in  the american association for the advancement of science aaas selected james hansen to receive its award for scientific freedom and responsibility for his courageous and steadfast advocacy in support of scientists responsibilities to communicate their scientific opinions and findings openly and honestly on matters of public importance in  hansen shared the us million dan david prize for achievements having an outstanding scientific technological cultural or social impact on our world in  he received the pnc bank common wealth award of distinguished service for his outstanding achievements in science at the end of  hansen was named by earthsky communications and a panel of  scientistadvisors as the scientist communicator of the year citing him as an outspoken authority on climate change who had best communicated with the public about vital science issues or concepts during  in  hansen was awarded the  carlgustaf rossby research medal the highest honor bestowed by the american meteorological society for his outstanding contributions to climate modeling understanding climate change forcings and sensitivity and for clear communication of climate science in the public arena hansen won the  sophie prize set up in  by norwegian jostein gaarder the author of the  bestselling novel and teenagers guide to philosophy sophies world for his  key role for the development of our understanding of humaninduced climate change foreign policy named hansen one of its  fp top  global thinkers for sounding the alarm on climate change early and often in december  hansen received the commonwealth club of california’s annual stephen h schneider award for outstanding climate science communications at a ceremony in san francisco on november   hansen received the joseph priestley award at dickinson college in carlisle pennsylvania for his work advancing our understanding of climate change including the early application of numerical models to better understand observed climate trends and to project humans impact on climate and for his leadership in promoting public understanding of climate and linking the knowledge to action on climate policy he delivered a lecture entitled white house arrest and the climate crisis later that same day at anita tuvin schlechter auditorium on the colleges campus james hansen is cowinner with climatologist syukuro manabe of the bbva foundation frontiers of knowledge award in the climate change category in this ninth edition  of the awards the two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior decades ago they correctly predicted how much earth’s temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric co the scores of models currently in use to chart climate evolution are heirs to those developed by manabe and hansen controversiesedit political interference at nasaedit in  hansen alleged that in  nasa administrators had attempted to influence his public statements about the causes of climate change hansen said that nasa public relations staff were ordered to review his public statements and interviews after a december  lecture at the american geophysical union in san francisco nasa responded that its policies are similar to those of any other federal agency in requiring employees to coordinate all statements with the public affairs office without exception two years after hansen and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political appointees the agency’s inspector general confirmed that such activities had taken place with the nasa office of public affairs having reduced marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public in june  hansen appeared on  minutes stating that the george w bush white house had edited climaterelated press releases reported by federal agencies to make global warming seem less threatening he also stated that he was unable to speak freely without the backlash of other government officials and that he had not experienced that level of restrictions on communicating with the public during his career trials for energy company executivesedit in  interviews with abc news the guardian and in a separate oped hansen has called for putting fossil fuel company executives including the ceos of exxonmobil and peabody coal on trial for high crimes against humanity and nature on the grounds that these and other fossilfuel companies had actively spread doubt and misinformation about global warming in the same way that tobacco companies tried to hide the link between smoking and cancer arrest for protest demonstrationedit hansen and  other activists were arrested in august and september  at another demonstration in front of the white house hansen urged president obama to reject the keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca tar sands to the gulf of mexico on february   hansen was again arrested at the white house along with daryl hannah and robert f kennedy jr during a further protest against the proposed keystone pipeline extension criticismedit this articles criticism or controversy section may compromise the articles neutral point of view of the subject please integrate the sections contents into the article as a whole or rewrite the material december  in january  andrew freedman wrote in the washington post that the american meteorological society had erred in giving hansen its carlgustaf rossby research medal his body of work is not at issue rather the problem arises due to the ams recognition of hansens public communication work on climate change former ams member joseph daleo a skeptic of humancaused climate change also criticized the award also in  physicist freeman dyson criticised hansens climatechange activism the person who is really responsible for this overestimate of global warming is jim hansen he consistently exaggerates all the dangers hansen has turned his science into ideology hansen responded that if dyson is going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet then he should first do his homework dyson stated in an interview that the argument with hansen was exaggerated by the new york times stating that he and hansen are friends but we dont agree on everything after hansens arrest in  in west virginia new york times columnist andrew revkin wrote dr hansen has pushed far beyond the boundaries of the conventional role of scientists particularly government scientists in the environmental policy debate in june  new yorker journalist elizabeth kolbert wrote that hansen is increasingly isolated among climate activists eileen claussen president of the pew center on global climate change said that i view jim hansen as heroic as a scientist but i wish he would stick to what he really knows because i dont think he has a realistic idea of what is politically possible or what the best policies would be to deal with this problem in july  new york times climate columnist christa marshall asked if hansen still matters in the ongoing climate debate noting that he has irked many longtime supporters with his scathing attacks against president obamas plan for a capandtrade system the right wing loves what hes doing said joseph romm a senior fellow at the center for american progress a think tank hansen said that he had to speak out since few others could explain the links between politics

website wwwcolumbiaedujeh james edward hansen born  march  is an american adjunct professor in the department of earth and environmental sciences at columbia university he is best known for his research in climatology his  congressional testimony on climate change that helped raise broad awareness of global warming and his advocacy of action to avoid dangerous climate change in recent years he has become a climate activist to mitigate the effects of climate change on a few occasions leading to his arrest in  hansen advanced an alternative view of global warming over the last  years arguing that during that time frame the negative forcing via aerosols and the positive forcing via co largely balanced each other out and that the ± °c net rise in average global temperatures could mostly be explained by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons however even then he wrote the future balance of forcings is likely to shift toward dominance

hansen and gladys ray hansen he was trained in physics and astronomy in the space science program of james van allen at the university of iowa he obtained a ba in physics and mathematics with highest distinction in  an ms in astronomy in  and a phd in physics in  all three degrees from the university of iowa he participated in the nasa graduate traineeship from  to  and at the same time between  and  he was a visiting student at the institute of astrophysics at the university of kyoto and in the department of astronomy at the university of tokyo hansen then began work at the goddard institute for space studies in  careeredit after graduate school hansen continued his work with radiative transfer models attempting to understand the venusian atmosphere later he applied and refined these models to understand the earths atmosphere in particular the effects that aerosols and trace gases have on earths climate hansens development and use of global climate models has contributed to the further understanding of the earths climate in  his first book storms of my grandchildren was published in  he presented a  ted talk why i must speak out about climate change from  to  he was the head of the nasa goddard institute for space studies in new york city a part of the goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland as of update hansen directs the program on climate science awareness and solutions at columbia universitys earth institute the program is working to continue to connect the dots from advancing basic climate science to promoting public awareness to advocating policy actions research and publicationsedit as a college student at the university of iowa hansen was attracted to science and the research done by james van allens space science program in the physics and astronomy department a decade later his focus shifted to planetary research that involved trying to understand the climate change on earth that will result from anthropogenic changes of the atmospheric composition hansen has stated that one of his research interests is radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres especially the interpretation of remote sensing of the earths atmosphere and surface from satellites because of the ability of satellites to monitor the entire globe they may be one of the most effective ways to monitor and study global change his other interests include the development of global circulation models to help understand the observed climate trends and diagnosing human impacts on climate studies of venusedit venus is surrounded by a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen and its clouds are sulfuric acid the thickness of the atmosphere initially made it difficult to determine why the surface was so hot in the late s and early s following his phd dissertation hansen published several papers on the planet venus venus has a high brightness temperature in the radio frequencies compared to the infrared hansen proposed that the hot surface was the result of aerosols trapping the internal energy of the planet more recent studies have suggested that several billion years ago venuss atmosphere was much more like earths than it is now and that there were probably substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface but a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere hansen continued his study of venus by looking at the composition of its clouds he looked at the nearinfrared reflectivity of ice clouds compared them to observations of venus and found that they qualitatively agreed he also was able to use a radiative transfer model to establish an upper limit to the size of the ice particles if the clouds were actually made of ice evidence published in the early s showed that the clouds consist mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets by  the composition of venus clouds had not yet been determined with many scientists proposing a wide variety of compounds including liquid water and aqueous solutions of ferrous chloride hansen and hovenier used the polarization of sunlight reflected from the planet to establish that the clouds were spherical and had a refractive index and cloud drop effective radius which eliminated all of the proposed cloud types except sulfuric acid kiyoshi kawabata and hansen expanded upon this work by looking at the variation of polarization on venus they found that the visible clouds are a diffuse haze rather than a thick cloud confirming the same results obtained from transits across the sun the pioneer venus project was launched in may  and reached venus late that same year hansen collaborated with larry travis and other colleagues in a  science article that reported on the development and variability of clouds in the ultraviolet spectrum they conclude that there are at least three different cloud materials that contribute to the images a thin haze layer sulfuric acid clouds and an unknown ultraviolet absorber below the sulfuric acid cloud layer the linear polarization data obtained from the same mission confirmed that the low and midlevel clouds were sulfuric acid with radius of about  micrometer above the cloud layer was a layer of submicrometre haze global temperature analysisedit a typical automated airport weather station which records the routine hourly weather observations of temperature weather type wind sky condition and visibility these surface stations are located around the world and are used to derive a global temperature the first giss nasa goddard institute for space studies global temperature analysis was published in  hansen and his coauthor analyzed the surface air temperature at meteorological stations focusing on the years from  to  temperatures for stations closer together than  kilometers were shown to be highly correlated especially in the midlatitudes providing a way to combine the station data to provide accurate longterm variations they conclude that global mean temperatures can be determined even though meteorological stations are typically in the northern hemisphere and confined to continental regions warming in the past century was found to be  °c with warming similar in both hemispheres when the analysis was updated in  the four warmest years on record were all in the s the two warmest years were  and  during a senate meeting on june rd  hansen reported that he was ninetynine percent certain the earth was warmer then than it had ever been measured to be there was a clear cause and effect relationship with the greenhouse effect and lastly that due to global warming the likelihood of freak weather was steadily increasing with the  eruption of mount pinatubo  saw a cooling in the global temperatures there was speculation that this would cause the next couple years to be cooler because of the large serial correlation in the global temperatures bassett and lin found the statistical odds of a new temperature record to be small hansen countered by saying that having insider information shifts the odds to those who know the physics of the climate system and that whether there is a new temperature record depends upon the particular data set used the temperature data was updated in  to report that  was the warmest year since the instrumental data began in  they also found that the rate of temperature change was larger than at any time in instrument history and conclude that the recent el niño was not totally responsible for the large temperature anomaly in  in spite of this the united states had seen a smaller degree of warming and a region in the eastern us and the western atlantic ocean had actually cooled slightly  saw a major update to how the temperature was calculated it incorporated corrections due to the following reasons timeofobservation bias station history changes classification of ruralurban station the urban adjustment based on satellite measurements of night light intensity and relying more on rural station than urban evidence was found of local urban warming in urban suburban and smalltown records the anomalously high global temperature in  due to el niño resulted in a brief drop in subsequent years however a  hansen report in the journal science states that global warming continues and that the increasing temperatures should stimulate discussions on how to slow global warming the temperature data was updated in  to report that temperatures are now  °c warmer than a century ago and conclude that the recent global warming is a real climate change and not an artifact from the urban heat island effect the regional variation of warming with more warming in the higher latitudes is further evidence of warming that is anthropogenic in origin in  stephen mcintyre notified giss that many of the us temperature records from the historical climatology network ushcn displayed a discontinuity around the year  nasa corrected the computer code used to process the data and credited mcintyre with pointing out the flaw hansen indicated that he felt that several news organizations had overreacted to this mistake in  hansen published a paper entitled global surface temperature change describing current global temperature analysis black carbon studiesedit the incomplete combustion of biomass during the yellowstone fires of  near the snake river introduced a large quantity of black carbon particles into the atmosphere hansen has also contributed toward the understanding of black carbon on regional climate in recent decades northern china has experienced increased drought and southern china has received increased summer rain resulting in a larger number of floods southern china has had a decrease in temperatures while most of the world has warmed in a paper with menon and colleagues through the use of observations and climate models results they conclude that the black carbon heats the air increases convection and precipitation and leads to larger surface cooling than if the aerosols were sulfates a year later hansen teamed with makiko sato to publish a study on black carbon using the global network of aeronet sun photometers while the location of the aeronet instruments did not represent a global sample they could still be used to validate global aerosol climatologies they found that most aerosol climatologies underestimated the amount of black carbon by a factor of at least  this corresponds to an increase in the climate forcing of around  wm which they hypothesize is partially offset by the cooling of nonabsorbing aerosols estimations of trends in black carbon emissions show that there was a rapid increase in the s after the start of the industrial revolution and a leveling off from – as environmental laws were enacted china and india have recently increased their emissions of black carbon corresponding to their rapid development the emissions from the united kingdom were estimated using a network of stations that measured black smoke and sulfur dioxide they report that atmospheric black carbon concentrations have been decreasing since the beginning of the record in the s and that the decline was faster than the decline in blackcarbonproducing fuel use a  paper used the giss climate model in an attempt to determine the origin of black carbon in the arctic much of the arctic aerosol comes from south asia countries such as the united states and russia have a lower contribution than previously assumed anthropogenic impact on climateedit hansen has warned that lowlying coastal areas such as florida seen here east anglia the netherlands oceanic islands and bangladesh are vulnerable to sea levels rising the united nations framework convention on climate change is an international environmental treaty that has the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system in  hansen wrote a paper called can we defuse the global warming time bomb in which he argued that humancaused forces on the climate are now greater than natural ones and that this over a long time period can cause large climate changes he further states that a lower limit on “dangerous anthropogenic interference” is set by the stability of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets his view on actions to mitigate climate change is that halting global warming requires urgent unprecedented international cooperation but the needed actions are feasible and have additional benefits for human health agriculture and the environment in a  presentation at the university of iowa hansen announced that he was told by highranking government officials not to talk about how anthropogenic influence could have a dangerous effect on climate because its not understood what dangerous means or how humans are actually affecting climate he describes this as a faustian bargain because atmospheric aerosols have health risks and should be reduced but doing so will effectively increase the warming effects from co hansen and coauthors propose that the global mean temperature is a good tool to diagnose dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system two elements are particularly important when discussing dangerous anthropogenic interference sea level rise and the extinction of species they describe a businessasusual scenario which has greenhouse gases growing at approximately  per year and an alternate scenario in which greenhouse gases concentrations decline under the alternate scenario sea levels could rise by  meter per century causing problems due to the dense population in coastal areas but this would be minor compared to the meter increase in sea level under the businessasusual scenario hansen describes the situation with species extinction similarly to that of sea level rise assuming the alternate scenario the situation is not good but it is much worse for business as usual the concept of dangerous anthropogenic interference was clarified in a  paper finding that further warming of  °c would be highly disruptive to humans an alternate scenario would keep the warming to below this if climate sensitivity were below  °c for doubled co the conclusion is that co levels above  ppm are considered dangerous but that reduction in nonco greenhouse gases can provide temporary relief from drastic co cuts further findings are that arctic climate change has been forced by nonco constituents as much as by co the  paper cautions that prompt action is needed to slow co growth and to prevent a dangerous anthropogenic interference climate model development and projectionsedit a comparison of global surface temperature computed for three scenarios and compared with two analysis of observational data vilhelm bjerknes began the modern development of the general circulation model in the early th century the progress of numerical modeling was slow due to the slow speed of early computers and the lack of adequate observations it wasnt until the s that the numerical models were getting close to being realistic hansens first contribution to numerical climate models came with the  publication of the giss model he and his colleagues claimed that the model was successful in simulating the major features of sealevel pressure and mb heights in the north american region a  science publication by hansen and a team of scientists at goddard concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to warming sooner than previously predicted they used a onedimensional radiativeconvective model that calculates temperature as a function of height they reported that the results from the d model are similar to those of the more complex d models and can simulate basic mechanisms and feedbacks hansen predicted that temperatures would rise out of the climate noise by the s much earlier than predicted by other researches he also predicted that it would be difficult to convince politicians and the public to react by the early s the computational speed of computers along with refinements in climate models allowed longer experiments the models now included physics beyond the previous equations such as convection schemes diurnal changes and snowdepth calculations the advances in computational efficiency combined with the added physics meant the giss model i could be run for five years it was shown that global climate can be simulated reasonably well with a gridpoint resolution as coarse as  kilometers the first climate prediction computed from a general circulation model that was published by hansen was in  the same year as his wellknown senate testimony the second generation of the giss model was used to estimate the change in mean surface temperature based on a variety of scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions hansen concluded that global warming would be evident within the next few decades and that it would result in temperatures at least as high as during the eemian he argued that if the temperature rises  °c above the – mean for a few years it is the smoking gun pointing to humancaused global warming hansen giving testimony before the united states congress in  in  hansen and colleagues compared the observations with the projections made by hansen in his  testimony before the united states congress they described the intermediate scenario as the most likely and that realworld greenhouse gas forcing has been closest to this scenario it contained the effects of three volcanic eruptions in the fiftyyear projections with one in the  whereas the recent mount pinatubo eruption was in  they found that the observed warming was similar to two of the three scenarios the warming rates of the two most modest warming scenarios are nearly the same through the year  and they were unable to provide a precise model assessment they did note that the agreement between the observations and the intermediate scenario was accidental because the climate sensitivity used was higher than current estimates a year later hansen joined with rahmstorf and colleagues comparing climate projections with observations the comparison is done from  through january  against physicsbased models that are independent from the observations after  they show that the climate system may be responding faster than the models indicate rahmstorf and coauthors show concern that sea levels are rising at the high range of the ipcc projections and that it is due to thermal expansion and not from melting of the greenland or antarctic ice sheets following the launch of spacecraft capable of determining temperatures roy spencer and john christy published the first version of their satellite temperature measurements in  contrary to climate models and surface measurements their results showed a cooling in the troposphere however in  wentz and schabel determined that orbital decay had an effect on the derived temperatures hansen compared the corrected troposphere temperatures with the results of the published giss model and concluded that the model is in good agreement with the observations noting that the satellite temperature data had been the last holdout of global warming denialists and that the correction of the data would result in a change from discussing whether global warming is occurring to what is the rate of global warming and what should be done about it hansen has continued the development and diagnostics of climate models for instance he has helped look at the decadal trends in tropopause height which could be a useful tool for determining the human fingerprint on climate as of  february update the current version of the giss model is model e this version has seen improvements in many areas including upperlevel winds cloud height and precipitation this model still has problems with regions of marine stratocumulus clouds a later paper showed that the models main problems are having too weak of an ensolike variability and poor sea ice modeling resulting in too little ice in the southern hemisphere and too much in the northern hemisphere climate forcings feedbacks and sensitivityedit estimated climate forcings between  and  in  hansen authored a paper called global warming in the twentyfirst century an alternative scenario in which he presented a more optimistic way of dealing with global warming focusing on nonco gases and black carbon in the short run giving more time to make reductions in fossil fuel emissions he notes that the net warming observed to date is roughly as big as that expected from nonco gases only this is because co warming is offset by climatecooling aerosols emitted with fossil fuel burning and because at that time nonco gases taken together were responsible for roughly  of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming in a  paper hansen discussed the potential danger of fastfeedback effects causing ice sheet disintegration based on paleoclimate data george monbiot reports the ipcc predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as  centimetres  ft this century hansen’s paper argues that the slow melting of ice sheets the panel expects doesn’t fit the data the geological record suggests that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion but flips suddenly from one state to another when temperatures increased to –°c –°f above today’s level  million years ago sea levels rose not by  centimeters but by  metres  ft the ice responded immediately to changes in temperature hansen stressed the uncertainties around these predictions it is difficult to predict time of collapse in such a nonlinear problem … an ice sheet response time of centuries seems probable and we cannot rule out large changes on decadal timescales once widescale surface melt is underway he concludes that present knowledge does not permit accurate specification of the dangerous level of humanmade greehouse gases however it is much lower than has commonly been assumed if we have not already passed the dangerous level the energy infrastructure in place ensures that we will pass it within several decades in  hansen authored a paper called climate sensitivity sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide in which he estimated climate sensitivity to be ± °c based on pleistocene paleoclimate data the paper also concluded that burning all fossil fuels would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans analysis of climate change causationedit the first action that people should take is to use the democratic process what is frustrating people me included is that democratic action affects elections but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash james hansen march  hansen noted that in determining responsibility for climate change the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate is determined not by current emissions but by accumulated emissions over the lifetime of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by this measure the uk is still the largest single cause of climate change followed by the us and germany even though its current emissions are surpassed by the peoples republic of china on public policy hansen is critical of what he sees as efforts to mislead the public on the issue of climate change he points specifically to the competitive enterprise institutes commercials with the tagline carbon dioxide—they call it pollution we call it life and politicians who accept money from fossilfuel interests and then describe global warming as a great hoax he also says that changes needed to reduce global warming do not require hardship or reduction in the quality of life but will also produce benefits such as cleaner air and water and growth of hightech industries he was a critic of both the clinton and george w bush administrations stances on climate change addressing the potential effects of climate change hansen has stated in an interview in january  we cannot now afford to put off change any longer we have to get on a new path within this new administration we have only four years left for obama to set an example to the rest of the world america must take the lead climate change activismedit us senate committee testimonyedit hansen was invited to testify before the united states senate committee on energy and natural resources on june   hansen testified that global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warmingit is already happening now and the greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate nowwe already reached the point where the greenhouse effect is important hansen said that nasa was  confident that the warming was caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and not a random fluctuation according to science historian spencer r weart hansens testimony increased public awareness of climate change according to richard besel of california polytechnic state university hansens testimony was an important turning point in the history of global climate change according to timothy m odonnell of the university of mary washington hansens testimony was pivotal ignited public discussion of global warming and moved the controversy from a largely scientific discussion to a full blown science policy debate and marked the official beginning of the global warming policy debate according to roger a pielke of the national center for atmospheric research hansens call to action elevated the subject of global warming and the specter of associated impacts such as more hurricanes floods and heat waves to unprecedented levels of attention from the public media and policy makers criticism of coal industryedit hansen has been particularly critical of the coal industry stating that coal contributes the largest percentage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere he acknowledges that a molecule of carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal has the same effect as a molecule emitted from burning oil the difference is where the fuel originally resides he says that most oil comes from russia and saudi arabia and that no matter how fuelefficient automobiles become the oil will eventually be burned and the co emitted in a  testimony before the iowa utilities board he stated that the united states has a large reservoir of coal which makes it a resource that can be controlled through action by us politicians unlike oil which is controlled by other countries he has called for phasing out coal power completely by the year  during his testimony before the iowa utilities board in  hansen likened coal trains to death trains and asserted that these would be no less gruesome than if they were boxcars headed to crematoria loaded with uncountable irreplaceable species in response the national mining association stated that his comparison trivialized the suffering of millions and undermined his credibility citing the reactions of several people and three of his scientific colleagues as his primary motivation hansen stated that he certainly did not mean to trivialize suffering by the families who lost relatives in the holocaust and then apologized saying he regretted that his words caused pain to some readers mountaintop removal miningedit james hansen arrested at a demonstration outside the white house august   on june   james hansen along with  other protesters including actress daryl hannah was arrested on misdemeanor charges of obstructing police and impeding traffic during a protest against mountaintop removal mining in raleigh county west virginia the protesters intended to enter the property of massey energy company but were blocked by a crowd of several hundred coal miners and supporters hansen said that mountaintop removal for coal mining provides only a small fraction of our energy and should be abolished hansen called on president barack obama to abolish mountaintop coal mining hansen and about  other people were arrested in september  in front of the white house in washington dc the group was seeking a ban on mountaintop removal or surface mining cap and tradeedit in  hansen spoke out against cap and trade advocating instead what he believes would be a progressive carbon tax at source carbon as oil gas or coal with a  dividend returned to citizens in equal shares as proposed by citizens climate lobby he has made many appearances and talks supporting the work of ccl retirement from nasaedit hansen retired from nasa in april  after  years of government service saying he planned to take a more active role in the political and legal efforts to limit greenhouse gases he also stated that he could not sue the government as one of its employees the same month the national center for science education an organization noted for defending the teaching of evolution in united states science classrooms named hansen as an advisor to support the extension of its area of concern into the teaching of climate change keystone pipelineedit in a cbc interview aired in april  as canadian natural resources minister joe oliver lobbied in washington dc for approval of keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca oil sands to the gulf of mexico hansen forcefully argued against the use of these unconventional fossil fuels according to intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and other energy organizations there is more than twice as much carbon in the tar sands oil than in conventional oil hansen argued that coal tar sands and tar shale should not be used as energy sources because of their carbon emissions and claimed that the completion of the keystone pipeline would increase the extraction of oil from oil sands he explained that the effects of climate change may not be apparent until the far future its not the case where you emit something and you see the effect we see the beginnings of the effect but the large impacts are going to be in future decades and that science is crystal clear … effects come slowly because of the inertia of the climate system it takes decades even centuries to get the full response but we know the last time the world was  degrees warmer sea level was  meters or  feet higher hansen urged president obama to reject the keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca oil sands to the gulf of mexico on february   hansen was again arrested at the white house along with daryl hannah and robert f kennedy jr during a further protest against the proposed keystone pipeline extension proposed solutionsedit most recently hansen has stated his support for a revenueneutral fee and dividend system to impose a price on carbon that returns the money collected from the fossil fuel industry equally to all legal residents of the united states in an interview on cbc television on march   dr hansen stated the solution to climate change has to be a rising price on carbon and then the really dirty fuels like tar sands would fall on the table very quickly they make no sense at all if you look at it from an economicwide perspective if we would simply put a fee on carbon – you would collect from the fossil fuel companies at the source the domestic mines or the ports of entry and then distribute that money to the public an equal amount to all legal residents that would begin to make the prices honest and thats what the economy needs in order to be most efficient right now the external costs of fossil fuels are borne completely by the public if your child gets asthma you pay the bill the fossil fuel company doesnt what we need is to make the system honest at the end of  hansen stated five priorities that he felt then presidentelect obama should adopt for solving the climate and energy problems while stimulating the economy efficient energy use renewable energy a smart grid generation iv nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage regarding nuclear he expressed opposition to the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository stating that the  billion us surplus held in the nuclear waste fund should be used to develop fast reactors that consume nuclear waste and thorium reactors to prevent the creation of new longlived nuclear waste in  hansen wrote an open letter to president barack obama where he advocated a moratorium and phaseout of coal plants that do not capture and store co in his first book storms of my grandchildren similarly hansen discusses his declaration of stewardship the first principle of which requires a moratorium on coalfired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide in march  james hansen coauthored a paper in environmental science  technology entitled prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power the paper examined mortality levels per unit of electrical power produced from fossil fuels coal and natural gas as well as nuclear power it estimated that  million lives were saved worldwide between  and  through the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels hansen also concluded that the emission of some  billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were avoided by nuclear power use between  and  looking to the future between  and  it was estimated that nuclear could additionally avoid up to  to  billion tonnes this paper elicited a critical response to hansens analysis from an international group of senior academic energy policy analysts including benjamin sovacool mv ramana mark z jacobson and mark diesendorf they said nuclear power needs large subsidies to be economically viable and typically there are substantial construction delays and cost overruns associated with nuclear plants sovacool et al say that hansen and kharechas estimates of chernobyl disaster mortalities is very low which biases their conclusions all of these factors are said to make hansens article incomplete and misleading hansen and his initial coauthor then countered each of their attempts at rebutting his paper and argued that all the data these scientists use to make their criticism lacks credibility in  with three other leading experts hansen was coauthor of an open letter to policy makers which stated that continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanitys ability to avoid dangerous climate change the reaction from antinuclear environmental groups eg the natural resources defense council sierra club and greenpeace was negative citing nuclear safety and security issues and the economics of nuclear power plants in a  article diazmaurin says that one of the main problems with hansens nuclear work is the use of still debated historical records he says that hansen extrapolated shortterm health impacts of nuclear power to longterm projections of climate science in  the world business academy wrote an open letter to hansen questioning his advocacy of nuclear energy honors and awardsedit hansen was elected to the national academy of sciences in  for his development of pioneering radiative transfer models and studies of planetary atmospheres development of simplified and threedimensional global climate models explication of climate forcing mechanisms analysis of current climate trends from observational data and projections of anthropogenic impacts on the global climate system in  he received the th annual heinz award in the environment endowed with us for his research on global warming and was listed as one of time magazines  most influential people in  also in  the american association for the advancement of science aaas selected james hansen to receive its award for scientific freedom and responsibility for his courageous and steadfast advocacy in support of scientists responsibilities to communicate their scientific opinions and findings openly and honestly on matters of public importance in  hansen shared the us million dan david prize for achievements having an outstanding scientific technological cultural or social impact on our world in  he received the pnc bank common wealth award of distinguished service for his outstanding achievements in science at the end of  hansen was named by earthsky communications and a panel of  scientistadvisors as the scientist communicator of the year citing him as an outspoken authority on climate change who had best communicated with the public about vital science issues or concepts during  in  hansen was awarded the  carlgustaf rossby research medal the highest honor bestowed by the american meteorological society for his outstanding contributions to climate modeling understanding climate change forcings and sensitivity and for clear communication of climate science in the public arena hansen won the  sophie prize set up in  by norwegian jostein gaarder the author of the  bestselling novel and teenagers guide to philosophy sophies world for his  key role for the development of our understanding of humaninduced climate change foreign policy named hansen one of its  fp top  global thinkers for sounding the alarm on climate change early and often in december  hansen received the commonwealth club of california’s annual stephen h schneider award for outstanding climate science communications at a ceremony in san francisco on november   hansen received the joseph priestley award at dickinson college in carlisle pennsylvania for his work advancing our understanding of climate change including the early application of numerical models to better understand observed climate trends and to project humans impact on climate and for his leadership in promoting public understanding of climate and linking the knowledge to action on climate policy he delivered a lecture entitled white house arrest and the climate crisis later that same day at anita tuvin schlechter auditorium on the colleges campus james hansen is cowinner with climatologist syukuro manabe of the bbva foundation frontiers of knowledge award in the climate change category in this ninth edition  of the awards the two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior decades ago they correctly predicted how much earth’s temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric co the scores of models currently in use to chart climate evolution are heirs to those developed by manabe and hansen controversiesedit political interference at nasaedit in  hansen alleged that in  nasa administrators had attempted to influence his public statements about the causes of climate change hansen said that nasa public relations staff were ordered to review his public statements and interviews after a december  lecture at the american geophysical union in san francisco nasa responded that its policies are similar to those of any other federal agency in requiring employees to coordinate all statements with the public affairs office without exception two years after hansen and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political appointees the agency’s inspector general confirmed that such activities had taken place with the nasa office of public affairs having reduced marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public in june  hansen appeared on  minutes stating that the george w bush white house had edited climaterelated press releases reported by federal agencies to make global warming seem less threatening he also stated that he was unable to speak freely without the backlash of other government officials and that he had not experienced that level of restrictions on communicating with the public during his career trials for energy company executivesedit in  interviews with abc news the guardian and in a separate oped hansen has called for putting fossil fuel company executives including the ceos of exxonmobil and peabody coal on trial for high crimes against humanity and nature on the grounds that these and other fossilfuel companies had actively spread doubt and misinformation about global warming in the same way that tobacco companies tried to hide the link between smoking and cancer arrest for protest demonstrationedit hansen and  other activists were arrested in august and september  at another demonstration in front of the white house hansen urged president obama to reject the keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca tar sands to the gulf of mexico on february   hansen was again arrested at the white house along with daryl hannah and robert f kennedy jr during a further protest against the proposed keystone pipeline extension criticismedit this articles criticism or controversy section may compromise the articles neutral point of view of the subject please integrate the sections contents into the article as a whole or rewrite the material december  in january  andrew freedman wrote in the washington post that the american meteorological society had erred in giving hansen its carlgustaf rossby research medal his body of work is not at issue rather the problem arises due to the ams recognition of hansens public communication work on climate change former ams member joseph daleo a skeptic of humancaused climate change also criticized the award also in  physicist freeman dyson criticised hansens climatechange activism the person who is really responsible for this overestimate of global warming is jim hansen he consistently exaggerates all the dangers hansen has turned his science into ideology hansen responded that if dyson is going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet then he should first do his homework dyson stated in an interview that the argument with hansen was exaggerated by the new york times stating that he and hansen are friends but we dont agree on everything after hansens arrest in  in west virginia new york times columnist andrew revkin wrote dr hansen has pushed far beyond the boundaries of the conventional role of scientists particularly government scientists in the environmental policy debate in june  new yorker journalist elizabeth kolbert wrote that hansen is increasingly isolated among climate activists eileen claussen president of the pew center on global climate change said that i view jim hansen as heroic as a scientist but i wish he would stick to what he really knows because i dont think he has a realistic idea of what is politically possible or what the best policies would be to deal with this problem in july  new york times climate columnist christa marshall asked if hansen still matters in the ongoing climate debate noting that he has irked many longtime supporters with his scathing attacks against president obamas plan for a capandtrade system the right wing loves what hes doing said joseph romm a senior fellow at the center for american progress a think tank hansen said that he had to speak out since few others could explain the links between politics

website wwwcolumbiaedujeh james edward hansen born  march  is an american adjunct professor in the department of earth and environmental sciences at columbia university he is best known for his research in climatology his  congressional testimony on climate change that helped raise broad awareness of global warming and his advocacy of action to avoid dangerous climate change in recent years he has become a climate activist to mitigate the effects of climate change on a few occasions leading to his arrest in  hansen advanced an alternative view of global warming over the last  years arguing that during that time frame the negative forcing via aerosols and the positive forcing via co largely balanced each other out and that the ± °c net rise in average global temperatures could mostly be explained by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons however even then he wrote the future balance of forcings is likely to shift toward dominance

hansen and gladys ray hansen he was trained in physics and astronomy in the space science program of james van allen at the university of iowa he obtained a ba in physics and mathematics with highest distinction in  an ms in astronomy in  and a phd in physics in  all three degrees from the university of iowa he participated in the nasa graduate traineeship from  to  and at the same time between  and  he was a visiting student at the institute of astrophysics at the university of kyoto and in the department of astronomy at the university of tokyo hansen then began work at the goddard institute for space studies in  careeredit after graduate school hansen continued his work with radiative transfer models attempting to understand the venusian atmosphere later he applied and refined these models to understand the earths atmosphere in particular the effects that aerosols and trace gases have on earths climate hansens development and use of global climate models has contributed to the further understanding of the earths climate in  his first book storms of my grandchildren was published in  he presented a  ted talk why i must speak out about climate change from  to  he was the head of the nasa goddard institute for space studies in new york city a part of the goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland as of update hansen directs the program on climate science awareness and solutions at columbia universitys earth institute the program is working to continue to connect the dots from advancing basic climate science to promoting public awareness to advocating policy actions research and publicationsedit as a college student at the university of iowa hansen was attracted to science and the research done by james van allens space science program in the physics and astronomy department a decade later his focus shifted to planetary research that involved trying to understand the climate change on earth that will result from anthropogenic changes of the atmospheric composition hansen has stated that one of his research interests is radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres especially the interpretation of remote sensing of the earths atmosphere and surface from satellites because of the ability of satellites to monitor the entire globe they may be one of the most effective ways to monitor and study global change his other interests include the development of global circulation models to help understand the observed climate trends and diagnosing human impacts on climate studies of venusedit venus is surrounded by a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen and its clouds are sulfuric acid the thickness of the atmosphere initially made it difficult to determine why the surface was so hot in the late s and early s following his phd dissertation hansen published several papers on the planet venus venus has a high brightness temperature in the radio frequencies compared to the infrared hansen proposed that the hot surface was the result of aerosols trapping the internal energy of the planet more recent studies have suggested that several billion years ago venuss atmosphere was much more like earths than it is now and that there were probably substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface but a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere hansen continued his study of venus by looking at the composition of its clouds he looked at the nearinfrared reflectivity of ice clouds compared them to observations of venus and found that they qualitatively agreed he also was able to use a radiative transfer model to establish an upper limit to the size of the ice particles if the clouds were actually made of ice evidence published in the early s showed that the clouds consist mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets by  the composition of venus clouds had not yet been determined with many scientists proposing a wide variety of compounds including liquid water and aqueous solutions of ferrous chloride hansen and hovenier used the polarization of sunlight reflected from the planet to establish that the clouds were spherical and had a refractive index and cloud drop effective radius which eliminated all of the proposed cloud types except sulfuric acid kiyoshi kawabata and hansen expanded upon this work by looking at the variation of polarization on venus they found that the visible clouds are a diffuse haze rather than a thick cloud confirming the same results obtained from transits across the sun the pioneer venus project was launched in may  and reached venus late that same year hansen collaborated with larry travis and other colleagues in a  science article that reported on the development and variability of clouds in the ultraviolet spectrum they conclude that there are at least three different cloud materials that contribute to the images a thin haze layer sulfuric acid clouds and an unknown ultraviolet absorber below the sulfuric acid cloud layer the linear polarization data obtained from the same mission confirmed that the low and midlevel clouds were sulfuric acid with radius of about  micrometer above the cloud layer was a layer of submicrometre haze global temperature analysisedit a typical automated airport weather station which records the routine hourly weather observations of temperature weather type wind sky condition and visibility these surface stations are located around the world and are used to derive a global temperature the first giss nasa goddard institute for space studies global temperature analysis was published in  hansen and his coauthor analyzed the surface air temperature at meteorological stations focusing on the years from  to  temperatures for stations closer together than  kilometers were shown to be highly correlated especially in the midlatitudes providing a way to combine the station data to provide accurate longterm variations they conclude that global mean temperatures can be determined even though meteorological stations are typically in the northern hemisphere and confined to continental regions warming in the past century was found to be  °c with warming similar in both hemispheres when the analysis was updated in  the four warmest years on record were all in the s the two warmest years were  and  during a senate meeting on june rd  hansen reported that he was ninetynine percent certain the earth was warmer then than it had ever been measured to be there was a clear cause and effect relationship with the greenhouse effect and lastly that due to global warming the likelihood of freak weather was steadily increasing with the  eruption of mount pinatubo  saw a cooling in the global temperatures there was speculation that this would cause the next couple years to be cooler because of the large serial correlation in the global temperatures bassett and lin found the statistical odds of a new temperature record to be small hansen countered by saying that having insider information shifts the odds to those who know the physics of the climate system and that whether there is a new temperature record depends upon the particular data set used the temperature data was updated in  to report that  was the warmest year since the instrumental data began in  they also found that the rate of temperature change was larger than at any time in instrument history and conclude that the recent el niño was not totally responsible for the large temperature anomaly in  in spite of this the united states had seen a smaller degree of warming and a region in the eastern us and the western atlantic ocean had actually cooled slightly  saw a major update to how the temperature was calculated it incorporated corrections due to the following reasons timeofobservation bias station history changes classification of ruralurban station the urban adjustment based on satellite measurements of night light intensity and relying more on rural station than urban evidence was found of local urban warming in urban suburban and smalltown records the anomalously high global temperature in  due to el niño resulted in a brief drop in subsequent years however a  hansen report in the journal science states that global warming continues and that the increasing temperatures should stimulate discussions on how to slow global warming the temperature data was updated in  to report that temperatures are now  °c warmer than a century ago and conclude that the recent global warming is a real climate change and not an artifact from the urban heat island effect the regional variation of warming with more warming in the higher latitudes is further evidence of warming that is anthropogenic in origin in  stephen mcintyre notified giss that many of the us temperature records from the historical climatology network ushcn displayed a discontinuity around the year  nasa corrected the computer code used to process the data and credited mcintyre with pointing out the flaw hansen indicated that he felt that several news organizations had overreacted to this mistake in  hansen published a paper entitled global surface temperature change describing current global temperature analysis black carbon studiesedit the incomplete combustion of biomass during the yellowstone fires of  near the snake river introduced a large quantity of black carbon particles into the atmosphere hansen has also contributed toward the understanding of black carbon on regional climate in recent decades northern china has experienced increased drought and southern china has received increased summer rain resulting in a larger number of floods southern china has had a decrease in temperatures while most of the world has warmed in a paper with menon and colleagues through the use of observations and climate models results they conclude that the black carbon heats the air increases convection and precipitation and leads to larger surface cooling than if the aerosols were sulfates a year later hansen teamed with makiko sato to publish a study on black carbon using the global network of aeronet sun photometers while the location of the aeronet instruments did not represent a global sample they could still be used to validate global aerosol climatologies they found that most aerosol climatologies underestimated the amount of black carbon by a factor of at least  this corresponds to an increase in the climate forcing of around  wm which they hypothesize is partially offset by the cooling of nonabsorbing aerosols estimations of trends in black carbon emissions show that there was a rapid increase in the s after the start of the industrial revolution and a leveling off from – as environmental laws were enacted china and india have recently increased their emissions of black carbon corresponding to their rapid development the emissions from the united kingdom were estimated using a network of stations that measured black smoke and sulfur dioxide they report that atmospheric black carbon concentrations have been decreasing since the beginning of the record in the s and that the decline was faster than the decline in blackcarbonproducing fuel use a  paper used the giss climate model in an attempt to determine the origin of black carbon in the arctic much of the arctic aerosol comes from south asia countries such as the united states and russia have a lower contribution than previously assumed anthropogenic impact on climateedit hansen has warned that lowlying coastal areas such as florida seen here east anglia the netherlands oceanic islands and bangladesh are vulnerable to sea levels rising the united nations framework convention on climate change is an international environmental treaty that has the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system in  hansen wrote a paper called can we defuse the global warming time bomb in which he argued that humancaused forces on the climate are now greater than natural ones and that this over a long time period can cause large climate changes he further states that a lower limit on “dangerous anthropogenic interference” is set by the stability of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets his view on actions to mitigate climate change is that halting global warming requires urgent unprecedented international cooperation but the needed actions are feasible and have additional benefits for human health agriculture and the environment in a  presentation at the university of iowa hansen announced that he was told by highranking government officials not to talk about how anthropogenic influence could have a dangerous effect on climate because its not understood what dangerous means or how humans are actually affecting climate he describes this as a faustian bargain because atmospheric aerosols have health risks and should be reduced but doing so will effectively increase the warming effects from co hansen and coauthors propose that the global mean temperature is a good tool to diagnose dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system two elements are particularly important when discussing dangerous anthropogenic interference sea level rise and the extinction of species they describe a businessasusual scenario which has greenhouse gases growing at approximately  per year and an alternate scenario in which greenhouse gases concentrations decline under the alternate scenario sea levels could rise by  meter per century causing problems due to the dense population in coastal areas but this would be minor compared to the meter increase in sea level under the businessasusual scenario hansen describes the situation with species extinction similarly to that of sea level rise assuming the alternate scenario the situation is not good but it is much worse for business as usual the concept of dangerous anthropogenic interference was clarified in a  paper finding that further warming of  °c would be highly disruptive to humans an alternate scenario would keep the warming to below this if climate sensitivity were below  °c for doubled co the conclusion is that co levels above  ppm are considered dangerous but that reduction in nonco greenhouse gases can provide temporary relief from drastic co cuts further findings are that arctic climate change has been forced by nonco constituents as much as by co the  paper cautions that prompt action is needed to slow co growth and to prevent a dangerous anthropogenic interference climate model development and projectionsedit a comparison of global surface temperature computed for three scenarios and compared with two analysis of observational data vilhelm bjerknes began the modern development of the general circulation model in the early th century the progress of numerical modeling was slow due to the slow speed of early computers and the lack of adequate observations it wasnt until the s that the numerical models were getting close to being realistic hansens first contribution to numerical climate models came with the  publication of the giss model he and his colleagues claimed that the model was successful in simulating the major features of sealevel pressure and mb heights in the north american region a  science publication by hansen and a team of scientists at goddard concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to warming sooner than previously predicted they used a onedimensional radiativeconvective model that calculates temperature as a function of height they reported that the results from the d model are similar to those of the more complex d models and can simulate basic mechanisms and feedbacks hansen predicted that temperatures would rise out of the climate noise by the s much earlier than predicted by other researches he also predicted that it would be difficult to convince politicians and the public to react by the early s the computational speed of computers along with refinements in climate models allowed longer experiments the models now included physics beyond the previous equations such as convection schemes diurnal changes and snowdepth calculations the advances in computational efficiency combined with the added physics meant the giss model i could be run for five years it was shown that global climate can be simulated reasonably well with a gridpoint resolution as coarse as  kilometers the first climate prediction computed from a general circulation model that was published by hansen was in  the same year as his wellknown senate testimony the second generation of the giss model was used to estimate the change in mean surface temperature based on a variety of scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions hansen concluded that global warming would be evident within the next few decades and that it would result in temperatures at least as high as during the eemian he argued that if the temperature rises  °c above the – mean for a few years it is the smoking gun pointing to humancaused global warming hansen giving testimony before the united states congress in  in  hansen and colleagues compared the observations with the projections made by hansen in his  testimony before the united states congress they described the intermediate scenario as the most likely and that realworld greenhouse gas forcing has been closest to this scenario it contained the effects of three volcanic eruptions in the fiftyyear projections with one in the  whereas the recent mount pinatubo eruption was in  they found that the observed warming was similar to two of the three scenarios the warming rates of the two most modest warming scenarios are nearly the same through the year  and they were unable to provide a precise model assessment they did note that the agreement between the observations and the intermediate scenario was accidental because the climate sensitivity used was higher than current estimates a year later hansen joined with rahmstorf and colleagues comparing climate projections with observations the comparison is done from  through january  against physicsbased models that are independent from the observations after  they show that the climate system may be responding faster than the models indicate rahmstorf and coauthors show concern that sea levels are rising at the high range of the ipcc projections and that it is due to thermal expansion and not from melting of the greenland or antarctic ice sheets following the launch of spacecraft capable of determining temperatures roy spencer and john christy published the first version of their satellite temperature measurements in  contrary to climate models and surface measurements their results showed a cooling in the troposphere however in  wentz and schabel determined that orbital decay had an effect on the derived temperatures hansen compared the corrected troposphere temperatures with the results of the published giss model and concluded that the model is in good agreement with the observations noting that the satellite temperature data had been the last holdout of global warming denialists and that the correction of the data would result in a change from discussing whether global warming is occurring to what is the rate of global warming and what should be done about it hansen has continued the development and diagnostics of climate models for instance he has helped look at the decadal trends in tropopause height which could be a useful tool for determining the human fingerprint on climate as of  february update the current version of the giss model is model e this version has seen improvements in many areas including upperlevel winds cloud height and precipitation this model still has problems with regions of marine stratocumulus clouds a later paper showed that the models main problems are having too weak of an ensolike variability and poor sea ice modeling resulting in too little ice in the southern hemisphere and too much in the northern hemisphere climate forcings feedbacks and sensitivityedit estimated climate forcings between  and  in  hansen authored a paper called global warming in the twentyfirst century an alternative scenario in which he presented a more optimistic way of dealing with global warming focusing on nonco gases and black carbon in the short run giving more time to make reductions in fossil fuel emissions he notes that the net warming observed to date is roughly as big as that expected from nonco gases only this is because co warming is offset by climatecooling aerosols emitted with fossil fuel burning and because at that time nonco gases taken together were responsible for roughly  of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming in a  paper hansen discussed the potential danger of fastfeedback effects causing ice sheet disintegration based on paleoclimate data george monbiot reports the ipcc predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as  centimetres  ft this century hansen’s paper argues that the slow melting of ice sheets the panel expects doesn’t fit the data the geological record suggests that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion but flips suddenly from one state to another when temperatures increased to –°c –°f above today’s level  million years ago sea levels rose not by  centimeters but by  metres  ft the ice responded immediately to changes in temperature hansen stressed the uncertainties around these predictions it is difficult to predict time of collapse in such a nonlinear problem … an ice sheet response time of centuries seems probable and we cannot rule out large changes on decadal timescales once widescale surface melt is underway he concludes that present knowledge does not permit accurate specification of the dangerous level of humanmade greehouse gases however it is much lower than has commonly been assumed if we have not already passed the dangerous level the energy infrastructure in place ensures that we will pass it within several decades in  hansen authored a paper called climate sensitivity sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide in which he estimated climate sensitivity to be ± °c based on pleistocene paleoclimate data the paper also concluded that burning all fossil fuels would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans analysis of climate change causationedit the first action that people should take is to use the democratic process what is frustrating people me included is that democratic action affects elections but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash james hansen march  hansen noted that in determining responsibility for climate change the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate is determined not by current emissions but by accumulated emissions over the lifetime of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by this measure the uk is still the largest single cause of climate change followed by the us and germany even though its current emissions are surpassed by the peoples republic of china on public policy hansen is critical of what he sees as efforts to mislead the public on the issue of climate change he points specifically to the competitive enterprise institutes commercials with the tagline carbon dioxide—they call it pollution we call it life and politicians who accept money from fossilfuel interests and then describe global warming as a great hoax he also says that changes needed to reduce global warming do not require hardship or reduction in the quality of life but will also produce benefits such as cleaner air and water and growth of hightech industries he was a critic of both the clinton and george w bush administrations stances on climate change addressing the potential effects of climate change hansen has stated in an interview in january  we cannot now afford to put off change any longer we have to get on a new path within this new administration we have only four years left for obama to set an example to the rest of the world america must take the lead climate change activismedit us senate committee testimonyedit hansen was invited to testify before the united states senate committee on energy and natural resources on june   hansen testified that global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warmingit is already happening now and the greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate nowwe already reached the point where the greenhouse effect is important hansen said that nasa was  confident that the warming was caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and not a random fluctuation according to science historian spencer r weart hansens testimony increased public awareness of climate change according to richard besel of california polytechnic state university hansens testimony was an important turning point in the history of global climate change according to timothy m odonnell of the university of mary washington hansens testimony was pivotal ignited public discussion of global warming and moved the controversy from a largely scientific discussion to a full blown science policy debate and marked the official beginning of the global warming policy debate according to roger a pielke of the national center for atmospheric research hansens call to action elevated the subject of global warming and the specter of associated impacts such as more hurricanes floods and heat waves to unprecedented levels of attention from the public media and policy makers criticism of coal industryedit hansen has been particularly critical of the coal industry stating that coal contributes the largest percentage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere he acknowledges that a molecule of carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal has the same effect as a molecule emitted from burning oil the difference is where the fuel originally resides he says that most oil comes from russia and saudi arabia and that no matter how fuelefficient automobiles become the oil will eventually be burned and the co emitted in a  testimony before the iowa utilities board he stated that the united states has a large reservoir of coal which makes it a resource that can be controlled through action by us politicians unlike oil which is controlled by other countries he has called for phasing out coal power completely by the year  during his testimony before the iowa utilities board in  hansen likened coal trains to death trains and asserted that these would be no less gruesome than if they were boxcars headed to crematoria loaded with uncountable irreplaceable species in response the national mining association stated that his comparison trivialized the suffering of millions and undermined his credibility citing the reactions of several people and three of his scientific colleagues as his primary motivation hansen stated that he certainly did not mean to trivialize suffering by the families who lost relatives in the holocaust and then apologized saying he regretted that his words caused pain to some readers mountaintop removal miningedit james hansen arrested at a demonstration outside the white house august   on june   james hansen along with  other protesters including actress daryl hannah was arrested on misdemeanor charges of obstructing police and impeding traffic during a protest against mountaintop removal mining in raleigh county west virginia the protesters intended to enter the property of massey energy company but were blocked by a crowd of several hundred coal miners and supporters hansen said that mountaintop removal for coal mining provides only a small fraction of our energy and should be abolished hansen called on president barack obama to abolish mountaintop coal mining hansen and about  other people were arrested in september  in front of the white house in washington dc the group was seeking a ban on mountaintop removal or surface mining cap and tradeedit in  hansen spoke out against cap and trade advocating instead what he believes would be a progressive carbon tax at source carbon as oil gas or coal with a  dividend returned to citizens in equal shares as proposed by citizens climate lobby he has made many appearances and talks supporting the work of ccl retirement from nasaedit hansen retired from nasa in april  after  years of government service saying he planned to take a more active role in the political and legal efforts to limit greenhouse gases he also stated that he could not sue the government as one of its employees the same month the national center for science education an organization noted for defending the teaching of evolution in united states science classrooms named hansen as an advisor to support the extension of its area of concern into the teaching of climate change keystone pipelineedit in a cbc interview aired in april  as canadian natural resources minister joe oliver lobbied in washington dc for approval of keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca oil sands to the gulf of mexico hansen forcefully argued against the use of these unconventional fossil fuels according to intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and other energy organizations there is more than twice as much carbon in the tar sands oil than in conventional oil hansen argued that coal tar sands and tar shale should not be used as energy sources because of their carbon emissions and claimed that the completion of the keystone pipeline would increase the extraction of oil from oil sands he explained that the effects of climate change may not be apparent until the far future its not the case where you emit something and you see the effect we see the beginnings of the effect but the large impacts are going to be in future decades and that science is crystal clear … effects come slowly because of the inertia of the climate system it takes decades even centuries to get the full response but we know the last time the world was  degrees warmer sea level was  meters or  feet higher hansen urged president obama to reject the keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca oil sands to the gulf of mexico on february   hansen was again arrested at the white house along with daryl hannah and robert f kennedy jr during a further protest against the proposed keystone pipeline extension proposed solutionsedit most recently hansen has stated his support for a revenueneutral fee and dividend system to impose a price on carbon that returns the money collected from the fossil fuel industry equally to all legal residents of the united states in an interview on cbc television on march   dr hansen stated the solution to climate change has to be a rising price on carbon and then the really dirty fuels like tar sands would fall on the table very quickly they make no sense at all if you look at it from an economicwide perspective if we would simply put a fee on carbon – you would collect from the fossil fuel companies at the source the domestic mines or the ports of entry and then distribute that money to the public an equal amount to all legal residents that would begin to make the prices honest and thats what the economy needs in order to be most efficient right now the external costs of fossil fuels are borne completely by the public if your child gets asthma you pay the bill the fossil fuel company doesnt what we need is to make the system honest at the end of  hansen stated five priorities that he felt then presidentelect obama should adopt for solving the climate and energy problems while stimulating the economy efficient energy use renewable energy a smart grid generation iv nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage regarding nuclear he expressed opposition to the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository stating that the  billion us surplus held in the nuclear waste fund should be used to develop fast reactors that consume nuclear waste and thorium reactors to prevent the creation of new longlived nuclear waste in  hansen wrote an open letter to president barack obama where he advocated a moratorium and phaseout of coal plants that do not capture and store co in his first book storms of my grandchildren similarly hansen discusses his declaration of stewardship the first principle of which requires a moratorium on coalfired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide in march  james hansen coauthored a paper in environmental science  technology entitled prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power the paper examined mortality levels per unit of electrical power produced from fossil fuels coal and natural gas as well as nuclear power it estimated that  million lives were saved worldwide between  and  through the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels hansen also concluded that the emission of some  billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were avoided by nuclear power use between  and  looking to the future between  and  it was estimated that nuclear could additionally avoid up to  to  billion tonnes this paper elicited a critical response to hansens analysis from an international group of senior academic energy policy analysts including benjamin sovacool mv ramana mark z jacobson and mark diesendorf they said nuclear power needs large subsidies to be economically viable and typically there are substantial construction delays and cost overruns associated with nuclear plants sovacool et al say that hansen and kharechas estimates of chernobyl disaster mortalities is very low which biases their conclusions all of these factors are said to make hansens article incomplete and misleading hansen and his initial coauthor then countered each of their attempts at rebutting his paper and argued that all the data these scientists use to make their criticism lacks credibility in  with three other leading experts hansen was coauthor of an open letter to policy makers which stated that continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanitys ability to avoid dangerous climate change the reaction from antinuclear environmental groups eg the natural resources defense council sierra club and greenpeace was negative citing nuclear safety and security issues and the economics of nuclear power plants in a  article diazmaurin says that one of the main problems with hansens nuclear work is the use of still debated historical records he says that hansen extrapolated shortterm health impacts of nuclear power to longterm projections of climate science in  the world business academy wrote an open letter to hansen questioning his advocacy of nuclear energy honors and awardsedit hansen was elected to the national academy of sciences in  for his development of pioneering radiative transfer models and studies of planetary atmospheres development of simplified and threedimensional global climate models explication of climate forcing mechanisms analysis of current climate trends from observational data and projections of anthropogenic impacts on the global climate system in  he received the th annual heinz award in the environment endowed with us for his research on global warming and was listed as one of time magazines  most influential people in  also in  the american association for the advancement of science aaas selected james hansen to receive its award for scientific freedom and responsibility for his courageous and steadfast advocacy in support of scientists responsibilities to communicate their scientific opinions and findings openly and honestly on matters of public importance in  hansen shared the us million dan david prize for achievements having an outstanding scientific technological cultural or social impact on our world in  he received the pnc bank common wealth award of distinguished service for his outstanding achievements in science at the end of  hansen was named by earthsky communications and a panel of  scientistadvisors as the scientist communicator of the year citing him as an outspoken authority on climate change who had best communicated with the public about vital science issues or concepts during  in  hansen was awarded the  carlgustaf rossby research medal the highest honor bestowed by the american meteorological society for his outstanding contributions to climate modeling understanding climate change forcings and sensitivity and for clear communication of climate science in the public arena hansen won the  sophie prize set up in  by norwegian jostein gaarder the author of the  bestselling novel and teenagers guide to philosophy sophies world for his  key role for the development of our understanding of humaninduced climate change foreign policy named hansen one of its  fp top  global thinkers for sounding the alarm on climate change early and often in december  hansen received the commonwealth club of california’s annual stephen h schneider award for outstanding climate science communications at a ceremony in san francisco on november   hansen received the joseph priestley award at dickinson college in carlisle pennsylvania for his work advancing our understanding of climate change including the early application of numerical models to better understand observed climate trends and to project humans impact on climate and for his leadership in promoting public understanding of climate and linking the knowledge to action on climate policy he delivered a lecture entitled white house arrest and the climate crisis later that same day at anita tuvin schlechter auditorium on the colleges campus james hansen is cowinner with climatologist syukuro manabe of the bbva foundation frontiers of knowledge award in the climate change category in this ninth edition  of the awards the two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior decades ago they correctly predicted how much earth’s temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric co the scores of models currently in use to chart climate evolution are heirs to those developed by manabe and hansen controversiesedit political interference at nasaedit in  hansen alleged that in  nasa administrators had attempted to influence his public statements about the causes of climate change hansen said that nasa public relations staff were ordered to review his public statements and interviews after a december  lecture at the american geophysical union in san francisco nasa responded that its policies are similar to those of any other federal agency in requiring employees to coordinate all statements with the public affairs office without exception two years after hansen and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political appointees the agency’s inspector general confirmed that such activities had taken place with the nasa office of public affairs having reduced marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public in june  hansen appeared on  minutes stating that the george w bush white house had edited climaterelated press releases reported by federal agencies to make global warming seem less threatening he also stated that he was unable to speak freely without the backlash of other government officials and that he had not experienced that level of restrictions on communicating with the public during his career trials for energy company executivesedit in  interviews with abc news the guardian and in a separate oped hansen has called for putting fossil fuel company executives including the ceos of exxonmobil and peabody coal on trial for high crimes against humanity and nature on the grounds that these and other fossilfuel companies had actively spread doubt and misinformation about global warming in the same way that tobacco companies tried to hide the link between smoking and cancer arrest for protest demonstrationedit hansen and  other activists were arrested in august and september  at another demonstration in front of the white house hansen urged president obama to reject the keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from canadas athabasca tar sands to the gulf of mexico on february   hansen was again arrested at the white house along with daryl hannah and robert f kennedy jr during a further protest against the proposed keystone pipeline extension criticismedit this articles criticism or controversy section may compromise the articles neutral point of view of the subject please integrate the sections contents into the article as a whole or rewrite the material december  in january  andrew freedman wrote in the washington post that the american meteorological society had erred in giving hansen its carlgustaf rossby research medal his body of work is not at issue rather the problem arises due to the ams recognition of hansens public communication work on climate change former ams member joseph daleo a skeptic of humancaused climate change also criticized the award also in  physicist freeman dyson criticised hansens climatechange activism the person who is really responsible for this overestimate of global warming is jim hansen he consistently exaggerates all the dangers hansen has turned his science into ideology hansen responded that if dyson is going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet then he should first do his homework dyson stated in an interview that the argument with hansen was exaggerated by the new york times stating that he and hansen are friends but we dont agree on everything after hansens arrest in  in west virginia new york times columnist andrew revkin wrote dr hansen has pushed far beyond the boundaries of the conventional role of scientists particularly government scientists in the environmental policy debate in june  new yorker journalist elizabeth kolbert wrote that hansen is increasingly isolated among climate activists eileen claussen president of the pew center on global climate change said that i view jim hansen as heroic as a scientist but i wish he would stick to what he really knows because i dont think he has a realistic idea of what is politically possible or what the best policies would be to deal with this problem in july  new york times climate columnist christa marshall asked if hansen still matters in the ongoing climate debate noting that he has irked many longtime supporters with his scathing attacks against president obamas plan for a capandtrade system the right wing loves what hes doing said joseph romm a senior fellow at the center for american progress a think tank hansen said that he had to speak out since few others could explain the links between politics
