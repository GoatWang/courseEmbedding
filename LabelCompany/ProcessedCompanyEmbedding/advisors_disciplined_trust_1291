who we are our firm our teamour vision our visionour team home  our clients  individuals individuals generational wealth at discipline advisors inc we take a comprehensive approach to estate planning and the management of our clients’ wealth we start by ensuring our clients have proper trusts and documents in place “we’ve helped hundreds of clients achieve peace of mind – and a common goal – that when their children receive their inheritance they will perceive their gift as inheriting a legacy not winning the lottery” – joe michaletz we strive to help our clients transfer their values along with their wealth to the next generation we spend the time necessary to educate explain and help our clients identify their vision mission values and goals we then work with a team including cpas and estate tax attorneys to customize proper estate planning documents to accomplish their goals at discipline advisors inc it is our passion to see our clients transfer their wealth with clarity with purpose while minimizing taxes and estate settlement costs retirement planning and income most retirees draw income out of their portfolios simultaneously pulling from equities as well as fixed income positions yet in a down market a greater number of equity shares must be sold to achieve the same amount of monthly income a share that no longer exists in your portfolio never has the ability to regain value once the market rebounds few retirees realize that those additional shares sold permanently reduce the average rate of return of the portfolio this is because the income withdrawal phase of a portfolio must be managed differently than the accumulation phase during the accumulation phase the order in which you receive particular yeartoyear returns has no impact on the resulting growth however during the income withdrawal phase the order in which you achieve particular returns – say  one year and  the next or vice versa – can substantially affect your principal our triple discipline investment system allows us to significantly and strategically reduce the number of equity shares sold to help produce retirement cash flow as a result we add to the longterm growth potential of your portfolio while maximizing the amount of potential income you can withdraw adv         dai privacy policy         concorde privacy policy securities offered through concorde investment services llc

individualsindividuals generational wealth retirement planning and income  exchange businessbusinesses your k solution who we are our firm our teamour vision our visionour team home  our philosophy our philosophy commingling with the herd the herd represents approximately  of investors – investors who make decisions in an emotional state of mind with a short time horizon and a short fuse they buy and sell based on greed and fear when a stock goes up they buy high when a position begins to decline they ride it down and often sell low if the assets of the longterm investor are commingled with the herd via mutual funds or large institutionally managed accounts the investor’s holdings are attached to the same emotional roller coaster fasten your seat belt the very person you would never go into business with or never appoint to your entity’s board has become your partner in risk we have unique strategies that separate us from the herd we can provide exclusivity and we can customize investment strategies to meet the needs of any client because of our independent nature we have spent over two decades developing a proprietary investment management system that removes human emotion from decision making thereby separating our clients from the herd it is based on three key disciplines which we use to our clients’ advantage and we never ever violate these three disciplines a word about capacity why bigger isn’t better ask any large mutual fund manager or manager of large institutional portfolios how long it would take to liquidate their largest holding without negatively impacting the price of the stock after an uncomfortable pause they’ll typically predict six months or more ask yourself – if the market’s going down do you have six months to wait capacity is defined as the length of time it takes for a manager to liquidate his or her largest holding without negatively impacting the price of the stock the capacity question is the first question we ask every money manager we interview if they cannot liquidate within five days or less they’re simply not a candidate for our system many investors feel safer in bigger funds or large institutional accounts many advisors advocate their selection we have strongly believe that bigger is not better consider this cause and effect the shortterm mentality of the herd reacts to even the most minor economic uncertainty and drives the market down large funds are forced to liquidate assets quickly and at their low point to meet the herd’s redemption requests by liquidating too much too quickly their actions inadvertently drive the price of a particular holding down alternatively their capacity constraints don’t allow them to get out quickly enough leaving their investors holding everdeclining positions and then the story gets worse most large funds are relegated to keeping no more than  in cash when the herd hears a spark of good news and the market shows promise of a rebound the herd reinvests plowing cash back into the managers’ hands it’s no longer a buyer’s market but the fund finds itself with too much cash because of the rules it is asked to follow it is forced to literally buy high not all privately managed accounts are managed privately many affluent individuals or institutional investors feel safer when invested in privately managed accounts however the institutional managers who manage those accounts typically also manage the mutual fund accounts with the same stock holdings therefore the privately managed accounts are forced to follow the same guidelines as the mutual funds and possess the same capacity issues our triple discipline investment system captures the agility of the market by hiring those individual money managers who oversee millions – not billions because most own their own privatelyheld firms they have the freedom to act on research and intellect we have found that there are many good stock pickers in the world but there are few good stock sellers that is why each of our managers is required to have a documented proven sell discipline based on technical research price targets and trigger points this protects our clients’ downside risk and once again removes human emotion from investing     adv         dai privacy policy         concorde privacy policy securities offered through concorde investment services llc cis member finra
