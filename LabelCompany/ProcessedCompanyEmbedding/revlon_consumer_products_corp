processing to developing countries  you will find the answers to these questions and solutions to many other professional concerns when you progress through our web site  skin care professional stay secure in era of political and economic uncertainties  important and helpful to know  the internet and globalization have created mass access to products that were designed to be exclusively sold at professional salons and spa this new trend is forcing salons and spas around the world to find alternative paths to compete and prosper traditionally salons and spas were using professional domestic and foreign popular brandname skin care products up to recent past these brands were truly exclusive only professionals were able to purchase these products wholesale and only through distribution channels designated by manufacturers this process of distribution granted you a professional advantage and exclusiveness over products available in department and beautysupply stores current global marketing developments such as the implementation of sales through the internet have virtually eliminated this exclusivity inevitably the internet has made it possible for your loyal customers to access the brandname product that you sell in your salon in a much faster more convenient and more affordable way the distributors that you rely on for your exclusivity are no longer able to control the spread of countless websites that offer consumers the identical brandname products found previously only at professional salons and spas like yours now literally anyone can purchase retail in a beauty supply store or online almost any salon brandname product   they are widely available on countless internet sites   this trend is already affecting your business diminished the professional image of your salon diminished your role as a provider of an exclusive product line inevitably caused the significant decline of your product sales and customer loyalty you have worked hard to establish your practice you have struggled to maintain your clientele you have invested monetarily as well as emotionally now is the time to safeguard and protect your investment   make a smart move toward your private label compare raya® quality and prices with products you are using now recognize that only promoting your own name on private label see options of private labeling skin care and
