arabidopsisplant j  sep doi jxx epub  may september the screening of enhancer detector lines in arabidopsis thaliana has identified genes that are specifically expressed in the sporophytic tissue of the ovule one such gene is the madsdomain transcription factor agamouslike agl which is expressed asymmetrically in the endothelial layer of the ovule adjacent to the developing haploid female gametophyte transcription of agl is regulated at multiple stages of development by enhancer and silencer elements located in both the upstream regulatory region and the large first intron these include a bipartite enhancer which requires elements in both the upstream regulatory region and the first intron active in the endothelium transcription of the agl locus which encodes the other member of the agl subfamily in arabidopsis is also regulated by elements located in the upstream regulatory region and in the first intron there is however no overlapping expression of agl and agl except in the chalaza of the developing ovule as was shown using a dual gene reporter system phylogenetic shadowing of the first intron of agl and agl homologs from other brassicaceae identified four regions of conservation that probably contain the binding sites of transcriptional regulators three of which are conserved outside brassicaceae further phylogenetic analysis using the proteinencoding domains of agl and agl revealed that the mads dnabinding domain shows considerable divergence together these results suggest that agl and agl show signs of subfunctionalization with divergent expression patterns

twocomponent system for tissuespecific gene induction in arabidopsisplant physiolaugust developmental progression and differentiation of distinct cell types depend on the regulation of gene expression in space and time tools that allow spatial and temporal control of gene expression are crucial for the accurate elucidation of gene function most systems to manipulate gene expression allow control of only one factor space or time and currently available systems that control both temporal and spatial expression of genes have their limitations we have developed a versatile twocomponent system that overcomes these limitations providing reliable conditional gene activation in restricted tissues or cell types this system allows conditional tissuespecific ectopic gene expression and provides a tool for conditional cell type or tissuespecific complementation of mutants the chimeric transcription factor xve in conjunction with gateway recombination cloning technology was used to generate a tractable system that can efficiently and faithfully activate target genes in a variety of cell types six promotersenhancers each with different tissue specificities including vascular tissue trichomes root and reproductive cell types were used in activation constructs to generate different expression patterns of xve conditional transactivation of reporter genes was achieved in a predictable tissuespecific pattern of expression following the insertion of the activator or the responder tdna in a wide variety of positions in the genome expression patterns were faithfully replicated in independent transgenic plant lines results demonstrate that we can also induce mutant phenotypes using conditional ectopic gene expression one of these mutant phenotypes could not have

gateway expression clones when both the pentry and pdest vectors contain the same marker for bacterial selectioncsh protocnovember gateway cloning technology invitrogen takes advantage of bacteriophage λ sitespecific recombination the life cycle of λ alternates between the lytic and lysogenic stages dna can be inserted or excised from the escherichia coli host genome by recombination between specific sites attb bacterial and attp phage this process is mediated by the λ proteins int integrase and xis excisionase and a host protein ihf integration host factor gateway cloning technology uses this process to insert fragments of dna directionally into specially adapted vectors these vectors contain a negative selectable marker the ccdb gene to select against nonrecombinant clones promoter or gene fragments are made gateway compatible with adapter primers and amplified by pcr these fragments are used in a bp clonase reaction to create entry clones usually the pdonr vector used to generate such entry clones is chosen so that the antibiotic selection marker is different from that of the pdest vector which finally generates an expression clone this favors the selection of the expression clone and selects against the pentry clone now that many pentry and pdest vectors have been generated and made available in stock centers the antibiotic resistance genes are predetermined and may not always be compatible with each other this problem is frequently experienced by plant researchers since many fulllength cdna libraries have been generated using the pdonrtopo pdonr or pentra vectors which are all kanamycin resistant in bacteria and many pdest vectors have been adapted from conventional plant transformation vectors which are also frequently kanamycin resistant in bacteria the following protocol describes ways in which such difficult vector combinations can be used effectively to obtain the appropriate expression clone without having to convert the pentry clone or pdest clone to vectors with compatible antibiotic resistancesauthors basherudin n mark curtisdisruption of atmrp a guard cell plasma membrane abcctype abc transporter leads

through seed in the absence of meiosis and fertilization generating clonal progeny of maternal origin major benefits to agriculture could result from harnessing apomixis in crop plants although  apomictic plant species are known apomixis is rare among crop plants and the transfer of apomixis to crop varieties by conventional breeding has been largely unsuccessful because apomictic and sexual pathways are closely related de novo engineering of apomixis might be achieved in sexually reproducing crops early consideration of issues relating to biosafety and intellectual property ip management

analysis of genes in plantaplant physioloctober the current challenge now that two plant genomes have been sequenced is to assign a function to the increasing number of predicted genes in arabidopsis approximately  of genes can be assigned a putative function however less than  of these have been assigned a function by direct experimental evidence to identify these functions many genes will have to undergo comprehensive analyses which will include the production of chimeric transgenes for constitutive or inducible ectopic expression for antisense or dominant negative expression for subcellular localization studies for promoter analysis and for gene complementation studies the production of such transgenes is often hampered by laborious conventional cloning technology that relies on restriction digestion and ligation with the aim of providing tools for high throughput gene analysis we have produced a gatewaycompatible agrobacterium sp binary vector system that facilitates fast and reliable dna cloning this collection of vectors is freely available for noncommercial purposes and can be used for the ectopic expression of genes either constitutively or inducibly the vectors can be used for the expression of protein fusions to the aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein and to the betaglucuronidase protein so that the subcellular localization of a protein can be identified they can also be used to generate promoterreporter constructs and to facilitate efficient cloning of genomic dna fragments for complementation experiments all vectors were derived from

overcome future predicted global climate changes and short falls in food productionauthors mark curtis ueli grossniklausrecombinant dna vector design and constructionwileyoctober genomics biotechnology and biology in general have been enabled by methodologies to manipulate dna in a test tube a very tiny test tube restriction enzymes are used as molecular scissors ligases are used as molecular glue the polymerase chain reaction has become invaluable in amplifying and cloning dna in addition recombination systems have been developed as alternatives to restriction enzymes as cloning tools all these methods are useful in creating plasmids containing chimeric dna constructs that will be transformed into plantsauthors mark curtisplant genetics and developmentwileyseptember our understanding of nearly all aspects of plant growth and development have benefited from the application of genetic analyses early anatomical and physiological studies provided evidence for processes that allow the plant to respond to internal and external stimuli but genetics has provided the tools to revolutionize our understanding of the underlying mechanisms the development of new tools in molecular genetics the adoption of plant model organisms and the creation of databases for comparative gene analyses have all contributed to the rapid progress in our understanding of plant developmental biology in recent yearsauthors mark curtis ueli grossniklauspower electronics applications in utilitiesabb reviewdecember the power sector is changing rapidly due to ever increasing
