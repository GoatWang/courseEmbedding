logout separate accounts institutional subadvisory overview philosophy approach the potential advantages of a contrarian strategy behavioral finance senior management david n dreman david greenberg full analyst team our approach our investment team uses a disciplined bottomup low pe approach to investing we invest in companies with low pes that we feel exhibit strong fundamentals and historical earnings growth and that our analysis indicates will persist over the long run we believe that cheap stocks have better downside protection given their modest valuations relative to the respective benchmark the selection process sell discipline our sell discipline is as systematic as our selection process and benefits from our constant evaluation of the stocks in our funds both relative to themselves and their industries we will sell or trim positions when a stocks valuation rises above the market a stocks valuation exceeds that of its industry a stock experiences weak or declining price momentum andor deteriorating fundamentals risk management we believe true risk is the potential for a permanent loss of capital assuming an appropriate time horizon volatility is not true risk we attempt to mitigate true risk in three ways  valuation riskdont overpay for a stock  earnings power riskearnings power is temporarily and not structurally impacted  balance sheetfinancial riskmake sure the balance sheet is strong enough to weather market volatility view the potential advantages of a contrarian strategy you are going to a separate website under the dreman umbrella you are
