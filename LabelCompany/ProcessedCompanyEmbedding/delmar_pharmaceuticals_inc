currently studying val in a multicenter phase  clinical trial for patients with refractory glioblastoma multiforme gbm in accordance with the protocol that has been filed with the us food and drug administration fda val has received orphan drug designation in europe and the us for the treatment of gliomas our research to date suggests that the unique anticancer mechanism of val is distinct from platinumbased chemotherapy and much less susceptible to drug resistance mediated by p the p gene plays a central role in the protection of the human body from cancer and is responsible for initiating the process of programmed cell death or apoptosis which directs a cell to commit suicide if it becomes damaged or cancerous the p pathway is also integral to the activity of many chemotherapy drugs p is frequently mutated in nsclc and p mutations are highly correlated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor patient outcomes in nsclc delmar believes that these data support the potential of val to

the most common and lethal form of brain cancer  new cases are diagnosed in the united states each year median survival in newly diagnosed patients with best available treatments is  months standard treatment following diagnosis includes surgical resection to remove as much of the tumor as possible debulking followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temodarâźă temozolomide tmz nearly all patients diagnosed with gbm will relapse following firstline treatment with a year survival rate of approximately  following failure of frontline therapy with average year survival rate less than  val based on historical data and our own research we believe that val has the potential to offer physicians and patients a new paradigm in the treatment of gbm odna methylguanine methyltransferase mgmt is a dna repair enzyme that causes resistance to temozolomide the current standard of care in the treatment of gbm high expression of the mgmt enzyme is strongly correlated with poor patient outcomes we have demonstrated that vals cytotoxic mechanism has more potent activity against brain tumor cells in comparison to tmz and can overcome resistance associated with mgmt suggesting that val has the potential to surpass tmz as the current standardofcare in the treatment of gbm delmars research is backed by historical clinical trials with val that were conducted by the us national cancer institute nci demonstrating activity against gbm that is comparable or superior to tmz and other chemotherapies approved for the treatment of gbm delmar is conducting clinical trials with val as a potential

alternative to standardofcare temozolomide in mgmtunmethylated gbm vancouver british columbia and menlo park calif july   prnewswire  delmar pharmaceuticals nasdaq dmpi delmar and the company a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new cancer therapies today announced that the human genetic resources administration of china hgrac has approved the companys application to initiate a phase  safety and efficacy study of its lead product candidate val in newly diagnosed mgmtunmethylated glioblastoma multiforme gbm delmar was required to obtain hgrac approval because the trial involves analysis of patients mgmt status as a biomarker for patient selection and enrollment  our clinical trials to date have been focused on recurrent gbm for patients whose tumors have recurred following currently approved therapies obtaining hgrac approval represents a significant step toward maximizing the potential benefit of val in newly diagnosed gbm for patients whose tumors exhibit features such as high expression of mgmt which render them resistant to the current standardofcare chemotherapy said jeffrey bacha chief executive officer of delmar pharmaceuticals success of val as a frontline treatment would be a major turning point for the brain tumor community and this area of science up to  newly diagnosed gbm patients whose tumors exhibit highexpression of the dnarepair enzyme omethylguanine methyltransferase mgmt will be treated with val in combination with radiotherapy to examine the safety and efficacy of val in this population mgmt methylation status will be used as a biomarker for patient selection and only patients whose tumors are mgmtunmethylated will be enrolled  results of the trial will be used to guide design of global randomized trials which if successful would position val as a potential replacement for the current standardofcare chemoradiation with temozolomide for the approximately  of newly diagnosed gbm patients whose tumors feature mgmtunmethylated gbm gbm patients with mgmtunmethylated tumors exhibit a high expression of the mgmt enzyme which is directly correlated to resistance to temozolomide the current frontline chemotherapy used in the treatment of gbm mgmtunmethylated patients have particularly poor patient outcomes and significantly reduced survival compared to mgmtmethylated patients  delmar has demonstrated that vals anticancer activity is independent of mgmt expression against multiple gbm cell lines in vitro vals clinical activity against gbm has been established by delmars recent phase  clinical trials in refractory gbm and historical trials conducted by the us national cancer institute nci results of prior ncisponsored trials of val combined with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed gbm suggest a potential superior benefit of chemoradiation with val versus radiotherapy alone  months in comparison to similar studies involving temozolomide or nitrosoureas  –  months mr bacha continued gbm has been largely left behind in the recent advancements made in the fight against cancer and new therapies improving median survival have been lacking we strongly believe that val represents a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of gbm particularly for the  of newly diagnosed gbm patients whose tumors exhibit high expression of mgmt the trial is expected to open for enrollment in the coming weeks at sun yatsen university cancer center syucc in guangzhou china under the direction of professor zhongping chen md phd who serves as chair of the department of neurosurgeryneurooncology at syucc prof chen has authored dozens of publications and been involved in numerous international brain tumor trials he also currently serves as president of the chinese society for neurooncology and as editorinchief of the chinese journal of neurooncology kun tuo a subsidiary of quintilesims has been retained to monitor and oversee the conduct of the trial funding support for the trial will be provided by guangxi wuzhou pharmaceutical group co ltd guangxi wuzhou pharma under the terms of delmars collaboration with guangxi wuzhou pharma further details of the trial can be found at

val has been granted an orphan drug designation by the us fda office of orphan products for the treatment of glioma medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer and in europe for the treatment of malignant gliomas delmar has demonstrated that vals antitumor activity against gbm is unaffected by the expression of mgmt in vitro further details regarding these studies can be found at httpwwwdelmarpharmacomscientificpublicationshtml the companys recent outcomes in phase  clinical trials suggest that val may offer a clinically meaningful survival benefit for patients with recurrent gbm following treatment with both tmz and bevacizumab a welltolerated dosing regimen of mgmday on days   and  of a day cycle was selected for study in subsequent gbm clinical trials based on these results delmar has embarked on human clinical trials for val across multiple lines of gbm therapy these trials include i an ongoing singlearm biomarker driven phase  study to determine if val treatment of mgmtunmethylated adult gbm patients at first recurrenceprogression prior to bevacizumab improves overall survival compared to historical control with lomustine clinicaltrialsgov

arm biomarker driven phase  study to confirm the tolerability and efficacy of val in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed mgmtunmethylated gbm patients whose tumors are known to express high mgmt levels clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct delmar believes that the results of these studies may support a new treatment paradigm in chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of gbm about

contact pressreleasesfranklyinccomsource delmar pharmaceuticals incbiomarkerdriven clinical trial will explore safety and efficacy of chemoradiation with val as an alternative to standardofcare temozolomide in mgmtunmethylated gbmvancouver british columbia and menlo park calif july   prnewswire  delmar pharmaceuticals nasdaq dmpi delmar and the company a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new cancer therapies today announced that the human genetic resources administration of china hgrac has approved the companys application to initiate a phase  safety and efficacy study of its lead product candidate val in newly diagnosed mgmtunmethylated glioblastoma multiforme gbm delmar was required to obtain hgrac approval because the trial involves analysis of patients mgmt status as a biomarker for patient selection and enrollment  our clinical trials to date have been focused on recurrent gbm for patients whose tumors have recurred following currently approved therapies obtaining hgrac approval represents a significant step toward maximizing the potential benefit of val in newly diagnosed gbm for patients whose tumors exhibit features such as high expression of mgmt which render them resistant to the current standardofcare chemotherapy said jeffrey bacha chief executive officer of delmar pharmaceuticals success of val as a frontline treatment would be a major turning point for the brain tumor community and this area of science up to  newly diagnosed gbm patients whose tumors exhibit highexpression of the dnarepair enzyme omethylguanine methyltransferase mgmt will be treated with val in combination with radiotherapy to examine the safety and efficacy of val in this population mgmt methylation status will be used as a biomarker for patient selection and only patients whose tumors are mgmtunmethylated will be enrolled  results of the trial will be used to guide design of global randomized trials which if successful would position val as a potential replacement for the current standardofcare chemoradiation with temozolomide for the approximately  of newly diagnosed gbm patients whose tumors feature mgmtunmethylated gbm gbm patients with mgmtunmethylated tumors exhibit a high expression of the mgmt enzyme which is directly correlated to resistance to temozolomide the current frontline chemotherapy used in the treatment of gbm mgmtunmethylated patients have particularly poor patient outcomes and significantly reduced survival compared to mgmtmethylated patients  delmar has demonstrated that vals anticancer activity is independent of mgmt expression against multiple gbm cell lines in vitro vals clinical activity against gbm has been established by delmars recent phase  clinical trials in refractory gbm and historical trials conducted by the us national cancer institute nci results of prior ncisponsored trials of val combined with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed gbm suggest a potential superior benefit of chemoradiation with val versus radiotherapy alone  months in comparison to similar studies involving temozolomide or nitrosoureas  –  monthsmr bacha continued gbm has been largely left behind in the recent advancements made in the fight against cancer and new therapies improving median survival have been lacking we strongly believe that val represents a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of gbm particularly for the  of newly diagnosed gbm patients whose tumors exhibit high expression of mgmtthe trial is expected to open for enrollment in the coming weeks at sun yatsen university cancer center syucc in guangzhou china under the direction of professor zhongping chen md phd who serves as chair of the department of neurosurgeryneurooncology at syucc prof chen has authored dozens of publications and been involved in numerous international brain tumor trials he also currently serves as president of the chinese society for neurooncology and as editorinchief of the chinese journal of neurooncology kun tuo a subsidiary of quintilesims has been retained to monitor and oversee the conduct of the trial funding support for the trial will be provided by guangxi wuzhou pharmaceutical group co ltd guangxi wuzhou pharma under the terms of delmars collaboration with guangxi wuzhou pharma further details of the trial can be found at clinicaltrialsgov identifier number nctabout valval dianhydrogalactitol is a firstinclass dnatargeting agent that introduces interstrand dna crosslinks at the nposition of guanine leading to dna doublestrand breaks and cancer cell death val has demonstrated clinical activity against a range of cancers including gbm in historical clinical trials sponsored by the us national cancer instituteval has been granted an orphan drug designation by the us fda office of orphan products for the treatment of glioma medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer and in europe for the treatment of malignant gliomasdelmar has demonstrated that vals antitumor activity against gbm is unaffected by the expression of mgmt in vitro further details regarding these studies can be found at httpwwwdelmarpharmacomscientificpublicationshtmlthe companys recent outcomes in phase  clinical trials suggest that val may offer a clinically meaningful survival benefit for patients with recurrent gbm following treatment with both tmz and bevacizumab a welltolerated dosing regimen of mgmday on days   and  of a day cycle was selected for study in subsequent gbm clinical trialsbased on these results delmar has embarked on human clinical trials for val across multiple lines of gbm therapy these trials include i an ongoing singlearm biomarker driven phase  study to determine if val treatment of mgmtunmethylated adult gbm patients at first recurrenceprogression prior to bevacizumab improves overall survival compared to historical control with lomustine clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct ii a pivotal controlled phase  study in temozolomideavastin recurrent gbm star to evaluate overall survival versus salvage chemotherapy clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct and iii a single arm biomarker driven phase  study to confirm the tolerability and efficacy of val in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed mgmtunmethylated gbm patients whose tumors are known to express high mgmt levels clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct delmar believes that the results of these studies may support a new treatment paradigm in chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of gbmabout glioblastoma multiforme gbmglioblastoma multiforme gbm is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer gbm has an incidence of two to three per  adults per year and accounts for  percent of all primary brain tumors in the us alone approximately  people are diagnosed with gbm every year gbm accounts for  cancer deaths in the us annually current standard of care includes surgery radiation and treatment with temozolomide tmz however nearly all tumors recur and the prognosis for recurrent gbm is dismal most gbm tumors have unmethylated promoter status for omethylguaninednamethyltransferase mgmt a validated biomarker for tmzresistance secondline treatment with antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab has not improved overall survival os and year survival is less than about delmar pharmaceuticals inc delmar pharmaceuticals inc is developing cancer therapies in indications where patients are failing or have become intolerable to modern targeted or biologic treatments the companys pipeline is based around val a firstinclass smallmolecule chemotherapeutic with a novel mechanism of action that has demonstrated clinical activity against a range of cancers including glioblastoma multiforme gbm ovarian and other solid tumors eg nsclc bladder cancer head  neck in us clinical trials sponsored by the national cancer institute nci val has been granted an orphan drug designation by the us fda office of orphan products for the treatment
