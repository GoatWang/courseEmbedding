photos research interests menu research interests the research interests of our group include the total synthesis of biologically active natural products the development of new synthetic methods heterocyclic chemistry bioorganic and medicinal chemistry combinatorial chemistry the study of dnaagent interactions and the chemistry of antitumor antibiotics we place a special emphasis on investigations to define the structurefunction relationships of natural or designed agents in efforts to understand the origin of their biological properties as the exploration of the properties of complex natural products becomes increasingly more sophisticated with the technological advances being made in their screening and evaluation and as structural details of their interaction with biological targets becomes more accessible the importance and opportunities for providing unique solutions to complex biological problems has grown a powerful complement to the examination of the naturallyderived agents themselves is the preparation and subsequent examination of key partial structures agents containing deepseated structural modifications and the corresponding unnatural enantiomers of the natural products well conceived deepseated structural modifications may be used to address the structural basis of the natural products interactions with biological targets and to define fundamental relationships between structure functional reactivity and properties in these studies we address the challenging problem of understanding the beautiful solutions and subtle design elements that nature has provided in the form of a natural product and work to extend the solution through rational design elements to provide more selective more efficacious or more potent agents designed specifically for the problem or target under investigation central to such studies is the development of dependable synthetic strategies and the advent of new synthetic methodology to permit the preparation of the natural products key partial structures and analogs incorporating deepseated structural changes the resulting efforts have reduced many difficult or intractable synthetic challenges to manageable problems providing an approach not only to the natural product but one capable of simple extrapolation to a series of structural analogs as well in our own efforts this has provided the opportunity to fully explore the origin of the natural products properties and to devise agents with improved selectivity and efficacy synthetic methodology﻿ our ongoing investigations emphasize the development and application of hetero dielsalder reactions the thermal reactions of cyclopropenone ketals inter and intramolecular acyl radicalalkene addition reactions medium and large ring cyclization procedures and the benzannulation reaction of arylchromium carbene complexes in each instance the methodology development represents the investigation of chemistry projected as a key step in the total synthesis of a natural or nonnatural product most recognized of these efforts include theinverse electron demand dielsalder reactions of heterocyclic azadienes tetrazines triazines triazines triazines diazines including the first reported  organocatalytic dielsalder reaction that are widely used today not only in organic synthesis but also in bioorthogonal conjugation reactions we developed the inverse electron demand dielsalder reactions of acyclic azadienes nsulfonylazabutadienes identified transition state anomeric effect discovered the cascade  cycloaddition reactions of oxadiazoles explored the cycloaddition reactions of cyclopropenone ketals  cycloaddition and discovered of their reversible thermal  oc ring opening to pdelocalized singlet vinylcarbenes and subsequent cycloaddition reaactions   and  cycloadditions we also introduced acyl radical generation from phenylselenoesters and thir use in subsequent intermolecular and intramolecular alkene addition reactions discovered and devloped key palladiumcatalyzed reactions including the first examples of a pdmediated free amine amination of an aryl halide  unsymmetrical bipyrrole coupling via electrophilic pdii ch activation  and intramolecular pdcatalyzed indole macrocyclization  provided key contributions to the free radical hydrogen atom transfer hat functionalization cyclization or reduction of unactivated alkenes  and we introduced the concept of divergent total synthesis  natural products total synthesis﻿ we have pursued  a longstanding program targeting the total synthesis of complex biologically active natural products chosen by virtue of their properties and the development of new synthetic methodology or synthetic strategies designed for the natural products of interest with this technology in hand the studies are extended to the total synthesis of key analogs bearing deepseated structural changes used to define the structurefunction properties of the natural product to identify its biological target if unknown and to define the fundamental features of its interaction with its biological target many are first total syntheses defining or correcting the stereochemistry or structure  and often they constitute creative concise efficient total syntheses easily identifiable with our efforts highlights include the total syntheses of steptonigrin  juncusol  rufescine and imelutine  colchicine  lavendamycin  pdei and pdeii  cc  prodigiosin and prodigiosene  cisand transtrikentrin a  combretastatin d  duocarmycin sa  pyridoblamic acid  streptonigrone

engineering news article on ramoplanin may   biologically active cyclic peptides we have a long standing program on the total synthesis and evalutaion of naturally occuring biologically active cyclic peptides this has included efforts culminating in the total syntheses of a series of antitumor agents that act as dna bisintercalating drugs including sandramycin  luzopeptins ac  quinoxapeptins ac  thiocoraline  be  and triostin a  inhibitors of protein synthesis including cycloisodityrosine  deoxybouvardin  bouvardin  and ravii  inhibitors of pmdm binding including chlorofusin  and its seven unnatural diastereomers  as well as the natural products k of iii and iv  piperazinomycin  and hun  including its ala scan library of analogs  the relative and absolute stereochemistry of several of these  natural products were established by the total syntheses and subsequent seminal studies and their structureactivity relationships were conducted however the most recognized of our efforts in this area are the total syntheses of the glycopeptide antibiotics including vancomycin  and its aglycon  teicoplanin aglycon  ristocetin a aglycon  ramoplanin aa aglycons  and a membered ala scan library of analogs  chloropeptins i and ii complestatin  and complestatins a  b  recently these studies have focused on the rational redesign of vancomycin to achieve dual binding to both daladala and daladlac altering a single atom in the binding pocket such that the new analogs are active against both vancomycinsensitive eg mrsa and vancomycinresistant bacteria eg vrsa vre in these studies we defined the origin of the destabilized binding to the altered daladlac target in resistant bacteria fold derived from repulsive lone pairlone pair interaction fold from lost hbond  this led to the design and total synthesis of ychnhtpgvancomycin  and ycnhnhtpgvancomycin  and earlier their aglycons   the recent total syntheses of their corresponding chlorobiphenyl derivatives have provided glycopeptide antiobiotic analogs  that contain synergistic binding pocket and peripheral modifications  that are endowed with two independent mechanisms of action only one of which is dependent upon daladala binding  that display a broad spectrum of activity eg mrsa vana and vanb vre at remarkable potencies mics   mgml and  that might well prove to be durable antibiotics capable of extensive use

exquisite targetbased activation more than  publications and more than  analogs of the natural products eg cbi have been disclosed containing deepseated structural changes used to define relationships between structure and reactivity or structure and activity and their contributions to the expression of the dna alkylation properties and biological activity of the natural products eg hydrophobic

efficiency of dna cleavage and provided a high resolution nmrderived structure of dna bound deglycobleomycin a we prepared a membered screening library of distamycin analogs discovered and defined the dna crosslinking properties of ischrysohermidin and established the origin of its selectivity and have studied the naturally occuring bisintercalators sandramycin luzopeptins quinoxapeptins thiocoraline be defining their dna binding selectivity its origins kinetics of binding and established a high resolution nmrderived structure of sandramycin bound to dna in the course of these studies we introduced the powerful fluorescent intercalator displacement fid assay for establishing dna binding selectvity or affinity that complements footprinting and a convenient mderived alternative to pendlabeling of restriction fragments for dna cleavage studies story in modern drug discovery september  oleamide an endogenous sleepinducing lipid we have been involved in a long standing program that emerged from the discovery of oleamide as an endogenous signaling molecule  promoting physiological sleep representing the first of a growing class of endogenous signaling fatty acid primary amides  publications to date this led to the discovery and subsequent characterization of the enzymes responsible for their release pam and degradation eg fatty acid amide hydrolase faah  development and optimization of orally active long acting potent selective and reversible alphaketoheterocycle inhibitors of serine hydrolases including faah introduction of a powerful proteomewide abppbased selectivity screen for reversible enzyme inhibitors  characterization of inhibitor bound faah xray structures and in vivo validation of faah as a candidate therapeutic target this work showed that preventing the enzymatic hydrolysis of an endocannabinoid anandamide endogenous signaling molecule provides an effective and especially attractive approach for the therapeutic intervention for th etreatment of pain that avoids the side effects of a blunt force agonist acting on the target receptors cb and cb since this only potentiates an activated signaling pathway by increasing the concentration and duration of action of the released signaling molecules at its site of action it provides a temporal and spatial pharmacological control not available to a receptor agonist it is the work that has inspired subsequent efforts to target enzymes controlling endocannabinoid signaling for the treatment of pain and inflamation these studies are conducted with complementary uniquely

erythropoietin receptor epor solutionphase combinatorial chemistry we are actively involved in the synthesis of compound libraries for target validation  publications where we pioneered the use of solutionphase synthesis techniques being the first to introduce liquidliquid and liquidsolid ion exchange extraction for compound isolation and purification using both divergent and introducing
