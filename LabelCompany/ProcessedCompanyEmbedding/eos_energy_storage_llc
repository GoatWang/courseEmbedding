manufacturing of gridscale batteries and fulfillment of  mwh of qualified preorders eos registers unprecedented demand as the company closes its round c and scales up to deliver industry’s lowest cost energy storage solution in  may    am eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wireeos energy storage today announced a final closing of a  million round c equity financing supporting commercial launch of the company’s gridscale battery technology the round was led by altenergy llc an energy technology and infrastructure investment firm other investors included major strategic partners such as oci and nearly all of eos’s prior investors including nrg energy and fisher brothers a new yorkbased realestate firm the funding will accelerate the company’s transition to commercial manufacturing and product sales and deliveries eos is now selling its aurora  a containerized mwmwh dc battery system which will support renewable energy integration peak demand reduction and lowering of customer electricity bills at a disruptive price of kwh demand for the aurora product has surged since eos launched the commercial offering in january qualified preorders now exceed  mwh and are growing rapidly with deliveries beginning next year “we’re gratified to see this response both from our investors and from the market” says eos ceo michael oster “demand is being driven by utilities and developers in key international markets spanning six continents we couldn’t have found better financial partners to work with as we scale up to supply gigawatthours of commercial systems into a diversified project pipeline” eos has developed a longlasting znythtm battery technology that uses safe waterbased electrolyte innovative metal coatings and a novel hybrid cathode to enable extremely lowcost electricity storage aurora systems are currently being tested with con edison of new york and gdf suez and in the coming months with pacific gas  electric in california major utilities—including nrg exelon aep enel national grid and others—have joined eos’s genesis program to support development field testing and commercial deployment of the aurora product “we have evaluated the entire energy storage landscape and view eos as the clear leader in cost safety and performance” said altenergy founder and managing director russell stidolph “it’s the combination of great technology and a strong management team that we believe will make eos a big winner in the multibilliondollar stationary storage market as investors we appreciate the company’s emphasis on capital efficiency and believe that eos is on track to deliver a gamechanging product in ” eos provides full dc battery systems and through its aegis program is partnering with major system

when the wind is blowing or the sun shining variability of supply is driving utilities and renewable developers to search for solutions to integrate and optimize these intermittent power sources batteries can store variable electricity production from solar and wind for use when needed thus creating a firm dispatchable resource with enhanced energy capacity and immediate response time eos’ znyth® battery technology is ideal for time shifting wind—the majority of which is produced at night—or solar to better coincide with peak demand eos batteries can also defer or mitigate

storage  infoeosenergystoragecom opportunity the challenge the electric power industry suffers from one fundamental problem without costeffective storage electricity supply must instantaneously match demand the result is a costly and underutilized electricity grid what if we could buffer demand spikes using storage and meet growing needs with the infrastructure we already have mitigating the need for costly upgrades while decreasing environmental impact the solution eos unlocks value in existing grid infrastructure hover to see utilization with eos energy storage eos provides clean  efficient peaking capacity problem inefficient generation power plants used to meet peak demands are expensive inefficient and dirty we can meet peak demand with excess energy produced by baseload generation and renewables during off peak hours solution eos energy storage utilities and customers can use eos batteries to store excess efficient baseload generation and renewable energy produced off peak by discharging during peak hours eos obviates the need for new dirty inefficient peaking generation and reduces carbon emissions eos alleviates transmission  distribution congestion problem infrastructure congestion the electricity grid like our freeway system experiences costly congestion in instances or locations such as dense large urban load centers where peak demand often exceeds transmission and distribution capacity solution eos energy storage strategically siting storage in congested locations alleviates strain on the transmission and distribution system and mitigates the need for costly upgrades eos enables renewables as a firm power source problem intermittent generation renewables such as wind and solar are intermittent potentially introducing instability into the grid and limiting their viability as a firm dispatchable power source additionally peak production does not always coincide with peak consumption solution eos energy storage storage allows utilities and consumers to smooth production and time shift renewable energy solar electricity produced at noon can be stored and deployed as a stable power source at peak demand in the afternoon eos enhances grid resiliency  reliability problem supply chain vulnerability failure at a critical node or along a major transmission or distribution line could have major impacts on downstream electricity supply and can result in outages lasting from hours to weeks solution eos energy storage storage enables the operation of highly reliable microgrids with distributed renewable generation and storage local
