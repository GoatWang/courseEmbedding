sound framework of corporate governance for fly leasing and its subsidiaries the board recognizes that it is accountable to shareholders for the performance of fly leasing and to that end is responsible for instituting a system of corporate governance that operates in the best interests of shareholders while also addressing the interests of other key stakeholders corporate governance and good governance procedures can add to the performance of a company the creation of shareholder value and engender the confidence of the investment community fly leasing has a number of committees and policies in place to ensure good corporate governance the new york stock exchange nyse requires companies with listed shares to comply with its corporate governance standards as a foreign private issuer we are not required to comply with all of the rules that apply to listed us companies however we have generally chosen to comply with the nyse’s corporate governance rules as though we were a us company accordingly we do not believe there are any significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those that would typically apply to a us domestic issuer under the nyse
