reports success with thc and gw pharma reports success with thc and cbd combo in brain cancer phase  clinical trial february   at  am published by ncv newswire    5  gw pharmaceuticals achieves positive results in phase  proof of concept study in glioma gw intends to advance oncology research and development efforts london feb   globe newswire — gw pharmaceuticals plc nasdaqgwph “gw” “the company” or “the group” a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform today announced positive topline results from an exploratory phase  placebocontrolled clinical study of a proprietary combination of tetrahydrocannabinol thc and cannabidiol cbd in  patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or gbm gbm is a particularly aggressive brain tumor with a poor prognosis gw has received orphan drug designation from the us food and drug administration fda and the european medicines agency ema for thccbd in the treatment of glioma the study showed that patients with documented recurrent gbm treated with thccbd had an  percent one year survival rate compared with  percent for patients in the placebo cohort p median survival for the thccbd group was greater than 55 days compared with  days in the placebo group thccbd was generally well tolerated with treatment emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation in two patients in each group the most common adverse events three patients or more and greater than placebo were vomiting 5 dizziness  nausea 5 headache  and constipation  the results of some biomarker analyses are still awaited “the findings from this welldesigned controlled study suggest that the addition of a combination of thc and cbd to patients on doseintensive temozolomide produced relevant improvements in survival compared with placebo and this is a good signal of potential efficacy” said professor susan short phd professor of clinical oncology and neurooncology at leeds institute of cancer and pathology at st james’s university hospital and principal investigator of the study “moreover the cannabinoid medicine was generally well tolerated these promising results are of particular interest as the pharmacology of the thccbd product appears to be distinct from existing oncology medications and may offer a unique and possibly synergistic option for future glioma treatment” we believe that the signals of efficacy demonstrated in this study further reinforce the potential role of cannabinoids in the field of oncology and provide gw with the prospect of a new and distinct cannabinoid product candidate in the treatment of glioma justin gover gw’s chief executive officer these data are a catalyst for the acceleration of gw’s oncology research interests and over the coming months we expect to consult with external experts and regulatory agencies on a pivotal clinical development program for thccbd in gbm and to expand our research interests in other forms of cancer the study designed to evaluate a number of safety and efficacy endpoints comprised an initial phase where the safety of thccbd in combination with doseintense temozolomide an oral alkylating agent that is a standard firstline treatment for gbm was assessed in  cohorts of  patients each  following a satisfactory independent safety evaluation the study then entered a randomized placebocontrolled phase where  patients were randomized to thccbd as addon therapy compared with  patients randomized to placebo plus standard of care beginning in  and prior to initiating this study gw conducted substantial preclinical oncologic research on several cannabinoids in various forms of cancer including brain lung breast pancreatic melanoma ovarian gastric renal prostate and bladder these studies have resulted in approximately  publications and show the multimodal effects of cannabinoids on a number of the key pathways associated with tumor growth and progression cannabinoids have been shown to promote autophagy the process of regulated selfdegradation by cells via several distinct mechanisms including acting on the aktmtor pathway an important intracellular signalling pathway that is overactive in many cancers in glioma thc and cbd appear to act via distinct signalling pathways the combination of thc and cbd showed good efficacy in various animal models of glioma particularly when used in combination with temozolomide initial in vitro studies showed that the combined administration of thc and cbd led to a synergistic reduction in the viability of umg glioma cells when compared to the administration of each cannabinoid individually the coadministration of temozolomide with thc and cbd had further synergistic effects causing a significant reduction in cell viability these preclinical studies justified the initiation of the phase  clinical study gw’s portfolio of intellectual property related to the use of cannabinoids in oncology includes a number of issued patents and pending applications in both the us and europe this portfolio is designed to protect the use of various cannabinoids individually or in combination in the treatment of a variety of oncologyspecific disorders and product formulations about gbm gliomas are tumors that arise from glial cells mainly in the brain but can also be found within the spinal cord within the category of glioma there are multiple different tumor types gbm is the most common glioma and is one of the most common primary brain tumors accounting for  of all primary brain tumors ostrom et al  they are also the most aggressive with only  of patients surviving one year and only  surviving to year five brodbelt et al  studies of patients with highgrade gliomas showed that headache was the most common initial presenting symptom these headaches can be persistent lasting more than six months and are often associated with other symptoms including seizures visual disturbances cognitive impairment and nausea and vomiting depending on the location and growth rate of the tumor about gw pharmaceuticals plc founded in  gw is a biopharmaceutical
