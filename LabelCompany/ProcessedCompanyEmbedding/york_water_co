founded in  and is the oldest investor owned utility in the nation in the late s and early s the greatest fear in many colonial towns was fire during this period before electricity and central heating homes and businesses were heated and lit with flames oil lamps candles and fire places were part of everyday life on numerous occasions fire had almost destroyed york bucket brigades from the nearest well were often inadequate protection for the risks presented by fires a public water supply could provide the necessary volume of water and even enough pressure to help feed the hand pumps that the local fire companies operated  incorporation on february   the york water company was incorporated a group of local businessmen met at the indian king tavern issued stock and formed the company during the first year of operation the company contracted for  feet of logs for pipes with a diameter of  inches and a length of  feet the logs were bored out with a hole  inches in diameter the logs were floated down the susquehanna river and transported over land from wrightsville the first source was a spring on rathton road in an area called baumgartners woods site of the present penn state york campus water was conveyed from the springs to a reservoir that was constructed on queen street  the water was then piped into the area of the town square by the end of   homes had water on the premises  cast iron pipe a new piping material was introduced to york cast iron the old wooden water mains had served their purpose but they leaked and they couldnt maintain very much water pressure  steam pumping station the growing community outgrew the springs in baumgartners woods and decided to augment the supply by pumping water from the codorus creekthe land was purchased from george king at the intersection of kings mill road and penn street a new pumping station was constructed and used steam power to pump the water according to york water legend the fire in the first boiler was started from the pipe of a workman and burned continuously for  years until  when the company converted to electric pumps  expand west of the codorus on july   the first water main was constructed under the codorus creek according to philip smyser the great the perplexing difficulty  the doubtful operation  the tremendous undertaking with all its fearful threatenings is overcome the bold enterprise is accomplished  new threats new supply york was a booming industrial community the increasing industrial discharge of waste into the west branch of the codorus was polluting the water to such an extent that it was becoming unfit to drink the only solution at the time was to find a purer source and in  the company constructed a larger pumping station at brillhart station this ideal location was upstream of the confluence of the west and south branches and was located along a railroad track that was capable of providing coal for the steam operated pumps       typhoid many industrial towns were discovering that their unprotected water supplies were spreading typhoid fever the recently discovered use of filters was found to greatly reduce the outbreak of typhoid york constructed its first filtration plant on grantley hill in  this was the first successfully operated water treatment plant in pennsylvania shortly after the new treatment plant was completed chlorine was added to the purified water to further kill any harmful bacteria this original filtration facility was operated until the s when it was replaced by the new filtration plant this building burned down in   a park is born reservoir park bounded by grantley road and country club road was completed and made available to the public as  a public breathing spot to relieve the stress and strain of modern life  drought the natural flow of the south and east branches of the codorus creek proved inadequate to supply a growing industrial community the company purchased land in york and springfield townships for the purpose of building a dam to impound the water supply for periods of drought  first dam constructed on january   the dam was completed by february   the new dam was full and overflowing the lake was later named lake williams in honor of the companys general manager  completion of the best reforesting in the world in  the engineering society of york decided to make conservation conscious president coolidge aware of yorks exemplary reforestation efforts the message was sent via  carrier pigeons president coolidges reply congratulated york and noted that the planting of evergreens throughout the york water shed area was conceded to be the best reforesting of evergreens in the world  a remarkable office building the headquarters of york water is located at  east market street it is the former site of the home of samuel small and was purchased in  because the building is dedicated to the distribution of water the architect william b billmeyer thought it fitting to incorporate into the scheme of the decoration many elements relating to the gift of water to mankind artist gustav ketterer was commissioned to paint and decorate the ceiling in an appropriate manner  new filter building as the community continued to grow the need for an expanded water filtration facility was also required the new facility was initially built with a capacity of  million gallons per day and then expanded to  million gallons per day after many upgrades this facility is still in service today  expansion of dam due to the need to store more water for the postwar industrial community of york an expanded supply was needed four foot tall bascule gates were ordered from the york factory of s morgan smith now voith siemens these gates increased the capacity of lake williams from  million gallons to  million gallons    electrical pumping begins steam era ends steam powered pumps have been providing water to york since  in  electrical pumps were installed and the steam engines were maintained for backup until  when they were replaced by diesel driven pumps  want to read more the york water company history of steam engine water pumps  completion of the second dam in the midst of the drought of record york water was building a second dam now known as lake redman just upstream of lake williams when it was completed the total capacity of both lakes increased to  billion gallons  th anniversary and restoration of the magnificent ceiling the great ceiling was restored by james vallano a conservator who had extensive experience including ceilings in the capitol building in harrisburg  completion of the susquehanna river pumping station due to continued growth of the community an additional supply was developed that took advantage of the greatest source of water in the eastern united states the susquehanna river the pump station and  mile pipeline can deliver up to  million gallons of water per day  th anniversary in celebration of the companys th anniversary and the th anniversary of its stock being traded on nasdaq the company was invited to ring the closing bell at nasdaqs marketplace in times square new york city  first
