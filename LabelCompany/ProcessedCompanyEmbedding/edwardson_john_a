pm edt printerfriendly version email this crn article in the summer of  cdw ceo john edwardson began unfolding a strategy under which the vernon hills illbased it direct marketer would partner with smb solution providers the plan in return for their product business cdw would pass on services leads but it didnt pan out and cdw instead now aims to team with large national integrators edwardson explains cdws strategy shift its channel perspective and its competition with archrival dell computer in an interview with crn online executive producer jeff oheir crn in an interview with crn last year you said cdw was readying some programs that would allow solution providers to sell services in exchange for their product business where are you with that edwardson what happened is that it became clear to us that most of the people were doing business with want a name brand doing that services work the two independents were using are unisys and decision one along with hewlettpackard and sun microsystems one of the things thats really important to us is what we call an attach rate when we sell an hp compaq or ibm computer selling a warranty with that is the best form of service we can offer quickly customers really want to know that the oem is standing behind their product with warranties to a certain extent unisys and decision one are doing installation work we really have not broadened our channel partnerships to companies that dont have a national footprint because what we discovered is that going out and interviewing people was just too much work we couldnt have  vars in the northeast  in the southeast and  in the us it was just too many people to keep track of what weve done is to limit what were taking to market to a few big players that seems to be whats best received by our customers crn outside of the regular services cdw offers is the company doing anything with the independent solution provider to become a better partner edwardson not really there are a few solution providers were working with in the government business like saic and edsmore so in the government business because those customers want one throat to choke crn how much of cdws sales goes through solution providers edwardson we think it is under  percent we pay quite a bit of attention to it because some of our bigger oems forbid us from doing business with them others dont care so for example we cannot compete against distributors tech data and ingram micro on hp and compaq products crn to what extent is cdw aligned with ingram micro and tech data edwardson i spend as much time talking to tech data ceo steve raymund as any senior officer at hp we are their biggest customer and we buy literally hundreds and hundreds of different products from them the reason we will continue doing business with them is because of the service they offer we can take orders from customers until  at night tech data and ingram micro have big distribution centers close to our headquarters and we get shipments from them at  in the afternoon we turn the shipment and get it out to our customer by  that night thats something the big oems cant do if were ordering   or  boxes from hp sony or toshiba thats one thing but if we dont have enough of them in stock distributors can get them to us on a sameday basis whereas the oems might take a week or two theres a real reason for partnering with distributors because of our business and how quickly our customers want things delivered crn ingram micros venturetech and tech datas techselect are national networks of vars that serve the smb market unisys and decision one are great at warranty work but not necessarily as good at integration as the venturetech and techselect solution providers edwardson we just havent tried to build a var partner base and our people have looked at building multiple relationships a year ago i used the example of sears and how it uses all these companies that put up aluminum gutters some of them are really good at what they do and some of them are not i think establishing a network of var partners is more complicated right now than what we can do the numbers are big and there are too many of them crn youve previously said that cdw aims to become an  billion to  billion company but cdw would have a lot of work ahead to reach that goal especially if the economy doesnt turn around do you envision working with solution providers to help cdw grow its business at this time do you want to deal with them through formal programs edwardson were just not ready for it and at this point we really havent figured out how to do it productively and efficiently with hp unisys and decision one you can feel easier that the quality of the work will be done well consistently across the country and that is a big issue if we ever want to move in that direction there are four or five regional vars we can go to before we go to the local people id like to talk about the channel now crn go ahead edwardson im tired about all of the bitching from everyone heres what im thinking everyones going nuts over hps decisions and how they made the announcement that theyll be sending catalogs to smb customers well hp and compaq have been doing catalogs as independent companies for years but it isnt as if they are our only competitor the biggest direct competitor is the archenemy dell but then again ibm has been gong direct toshiba is going direct and everyone else is going direct when im working with my people on the inside i tell them that theres a reason why we exist as a company and why these  other companies exist there is a value to someone who can give great hightouch service on a local basis we have to do it as productively and efficiently as we can to compete against the others we have to do what we do better than they do in many cases customers dont want to wait a week or a week and a half for a box which they have to with any of these oems they want it tomorrow and thats where we fit in i do think hp has some valid points about the amount of inventory they need to get to they have to continue to make that number smaller on the other hand we do well because we have inventory available when companies want it i dont need hp telling me how much inventory i need to carry what i want is inventory available from hp the day i need it its the same for ingram micro tech data and anyone else hp has other issues like selling general and administrative costs that they have to get in line to be competitive with dell as an industry we have to work with the oems to get the inventory turnover to a point where its competitive but if they think thats the only issue they have then they are wrong crn what are some of the issues they have we couldnt have  vars in the northeast  in the southeast and  in the us it was just too many people to keep track of what weve done is to limit what were taking to market to a few big players that seems to be whats best received by our customers edwardson the other issues involve overhead in general what we find is that our account managers can sell an hp or ibm box for more than a customer would pay dell because those brands are still so important we can get  to  bucks more on a box than someone will pay dell i dont know if its because of the service we offer the brand or a combination of the two but what we really need from these oems is a quick response what we need from the vendors is a price out of the gate that is competitive with dell when we lose business we usually lose it because it has taken the vendor too long to get back to us i hope youre hearing this from hundreds of people because im pounding on my oems every day about this issue if you can give us realtime competitive authority then we can beat dell what happens is that it gets caught up in bureaucracy and by the time they get back to us if it has taken a couple of days or more the customer gets frustrated and buys elsewhere if there is an issue in the channel today that is the issue where the big guys are losing against dell is in responsiveness when we are in a competitive bid situation against dell if we can get a sameday answer we can usually win the business if it takes three days that business is usually gone i think all of us in the channel have to work together in certain ways such as pushing the oems to be more responsive the other thing isand this is one i really want to hit homeis that dells move to offer the channel a whitebox desktop was a token move and nothing more if their value of the channel is a  percent rebate on the volume that the local solution providers do that tells you how much dell values the channel what i dont get is this ive been talking to every major manufacturer we do business with that sells through dellware a dell division that resells thirdparty products and services and i keep asking them why theyre putting their products in dellware i just dont get it weve asked them why are you letting dell chairman and ceo michael dell build up a whole book of business on your brand and then when he gets it to the level where it is profitable he clones your product and puts his brand on it one of the messages i sing to all of the people we do business with is that when you talk to the executives of the oems ask them why do you do this how shortsighted can you be crn what makes dell cdws archenemy edwardson if we look at who we compete against the most its the local solution provider because there are so many of them but if i ask my people whose name you hear most often it is dell and its not so much on peripherals its on servers desktops and notebooks crn one thing dell is doing a lot of now is pushing the solution sell such as a wireless or a networking bundle whats cdw doing in terms of selling solutionoriented bundles edwardson where that comes in is when our specialty teams enter into customer relationships it may be a storage or a communications issue and then they will work with our account manager and customer to put together a package now we dont do the installation in the corporate world the customer has their local or internal people to do that work at this point in our growth that has not been an issue we have  percent to  percent of the market and there is an awful lot of market out there to get and we believe that our model continues to be what customers want crn could you name any vendors that are doing a particularly good job of working with the channel edwardson i dont really want to get into that because what im hoping is that were working better with most of them than they are with any of our competitors i meet with the senior executives on a regular basis if i send an email to microsoft ceo steve ballmer like i did a few days ago i get an answer the next morning we meet with our competitors too like i did at the tech data customer summit there are some things we obviously dont talk about but one of the things we talked about is creditcard fraud and how we can cooperate better on that i was delegated the responsibility for having all of the directors of credit of seven or eight of the biggest companies to start a communication process crn has your relationship with hp changed at all since the compaq merger edwardson were probably spending much more time with them since the merger than when they were independent companies crn what will cdw have to do to reach that  billion to  billion revenue goal that you set for the company edwardson there are two different things there is revenue growth and there is continuing to be the most productive and efficient at what we do for revenue growth the first focus is to do more business with the existing base of customers we believe we are getting between  percent and  percent of the total technology spend of our typical customer i want  percent when i say  percent of our customers are  percent of our revenue those people are giving us more than  percent to  percent so what do they value what is different with that relationship how do they talk to their account manager and what is it that the account manager knows or does were getting feedback on all of those things and were redoing training programs based on the feedback of those  percent crn cdw has always invested heavily in training what are you doing differently today edwardson were massaging those courses for many years our attitude was to make as many phone calls as we could make every day for example one of our top account managers had over  customers we had a discussion about how much he knew about what his customers did he knew very little his general approach was to call them up ask if they needed a box today and if they didnt he said hed call them next week now we have them focus on  customers instead of hundreds of customers we have not grown our account managers as much as we expected but the revenue per account manager has grown significantly thats because theyre getting to know their customers better the web continues to grow every one of those accounts is owned by an account manager who gets credit for that business what were trying to do with account managers is when someone wants to order something that doesnt take a lot of advice or service we try to encourage them to order it over the web you need to save your time for consultation and advising people not entering orders but when you want to talk to me about what kind of printer you need ill give you all day its a delicate thing to do but thats why were getting more revenue from account managers were not making more phone calls were getting to know our customers better were teaching them listening skills and how to ask the right questions product mix also continues to be important the sununix business continues to do very well were going to be moving upstream were getting more and more sales specialists the certification they need so we can move into the bigger boxes the other thing were beginning to do is hire a fieldsales force we are finding that approach is effective with certain types of accounts where the volume can be big enough
