us login search search heres why bunge ltd dropped as much as  today the company announced disappointing firstquarter  earnings maxx chatsko tmfblackngold may   at pm what happened shares of global agribusiness leader bunge ltd nysebg dropped as much as  today after the company announced firstquarter  financial results that were sharply impacted by delayed farmer selling in south america management expects that to shift results to later in the year as farmers play catchup and it still expects solid earnings growth for  compared to last year that didnt stop mr market from trimming nearly  billion off the companys market cap though investors do have a point bunge also took the slow start to the year as an opportunity to make slight adjustments to previously issued financial guidance it now expects fullyear  earnings before interest and taxes ebit to fall within a range  million and  million which is down from the prior range of  million to  million at market close the stock had settled to a  loss  image source getty images so what this is now the second year in a row that hiccups in south american agriculture have impacted bunge the good news is that delayed selling is only a shortterm problem created by the increasingly popular trend in recent years for farmers to store more grain on farms rather than in centrally located storage infrastructure that practice slightly alters the logistics of getting products from soil to market but with record soybean and corn harvests this year following weak harvests recently farmers are incentivized to sell aside from agribusiness which includes sales of oilseeds and grains other segments turned in respectable performances given the seasonal considerations food  ingredients saw an insignificant  drop compared to the yearago period meanwhile sugar  bioenergy improved over last years performance while fertilizer was essentially flat both of the latter segments typically achieve their weakest results during the first quarter of the year due to the interharvest period for sugarcane the timing factors for these segments coupled with delayed selling for soybean and corn harvests compounded the negative performance for bunge during the period now what while the results were disappointing there wasnt much bunge could control to change the outcome the good news is that farmers will pick up sales of the latest soybean and corn harvests in the coming weeks the robust sugarcane industry will resume after its annual multiweek shutdown and fertilizer sales will pick up in the second half of the year as farmers get ready for the next cycle the stock drop today stings but longterm investors should not be deterred maxx chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no
