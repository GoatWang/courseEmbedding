globalstar project was launched in  as a joint venture of loral corporation and qualcomm on march   the two sponsors announced formation of globalstar lp a limited partnership established in the us with financial participation from eight other companies including alcatel airtouch deutsche aerospace hyundai and vodafone at that time the company predicted the system would launch in  based on an investment of  billion globalstar received its us spectrum allocation from the fcc in january  and continued to negotiate with other nations for rights to use the same radio frequencies in their countries the first satellites were launched in february  but system deployment was delayed due to a launch failure in september  that resulted in the loss of  satellites in a launch by the russian space agency in february  it launched the last of  satellites— satellites and four inorbit spares another eight unlaunched satellites were maintained as ground spares the first call on the original globalstar system was placed on november   from qualcomm chairman irwin jacobs in san diego to loral space  communications ceo and chairman bernard schwartz in new york city in october  the system began friendly user trials with  of  planned satellites in december  the system began limited commercial service for  users with the full  satellites no spares in orbit in february  it began full commercial service with its  satellites and  spares in north america europe and brazil initial prices were minute on february   the predecessor company globalstar old globalstar and three of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under chapter  of the united states bankruptcy code in  restructuring of the old globalstar was completed the first stage of the restructuring was completed on december   when thermo capital partners llc was deemed to obtain operational control of the business as well as certain ownership rights and risks thermo capital partners became the principal owner globalstar llc was formed as a delaware limited liability company in november  and was converted into globalstar inc on march   in  globalstar launched eight additional firstgeneration spare satellites into space to help compensate for the premature failure of their inorbit satellites between  and  globalstar launched  secondgeneration satellites in an effort to restore their system to full service between  and  globalstar moved its headquarters from silicon valley to covington louisiana in part to take advantage of the states tax breaks and low cost of living products and servicesedit globalstar is a provider of mobile satellite voice and data services globalstar offers these services to commercial and recreational users in more than  countries around the world the companys products include mobile and fixed satellite telephones simplex and duplex satellite data modems and satellite airtime packages in late  globalstar subsidiary spot llc launched a handheld satellite messaging and tracking personal safety device known as the spot satellite messenger many land based and maritime industries make use of the various globalstar products and services from remote areas beyond the reach of cellular and landline telephone service global customer segments include oil and gas government mining forestry commercial fishing utilities military transportation heavy construction emergency preparedness and business continuity as well as individual recreational users globalstar data solutions are used for a variety of asset and personal tracking data

approximately  km system architectureedit gatewaysedit globalstar satellites are simple bent pipe analog repeaters unlike iridium a network of ground gateway stations provides connectivity from the  satellites to the public switched telephone network and internet a satellite must have a gateway station in view to provide service to any users it may see twenty four globalstar gateways are located around the world including  in north america globalstar gateways are the largest cellular base stations in the world with a design capacity for over  concurrent phone calls over a coverage area that is roughly  of the size of the usa globalstar supports cdma technology such as the rake receiver and soft handoffs so a handset may be talking via two spot beams to two gateways for path diversity globalstar users are assigned telephone numbers on the north american numbering plan in north america or the appropriate telephone numbering plan for the country that the overseas gateway is located in except for brazil where the official globalstar country code  is used the use of gateway ground stations provides customers with localized regional phone numbers for their satellite handsets but if there are no gateway stations to cover certain remote areas such as areas of the south pacific and the polar regions service cannot be provided in these remote areas even if the satellites may fly over them as of may  voice and fullduplex data service is currently nonfunctional over much of africa the south asian subcontinent and most midocean regions due to lack of nearby gateway earth stations the globalstar system uses the qualcomm cdma air interface however the ericsson and telit phones accept standard gsm sim cards while the qualcomm gsp phones do not have a sim card interface but use cdmais based authentication therefore the globalstar gateways need to support both the cdmais and the gsm standards globalstar has roaming agreements with local cellular operators in some regions enabling the use of a single phone number in satellite and cellular mode on multimode globalstar handsets these cellular roaming agreements are not in place in north america because of improvements in cellular phones and networks and the limitations inherent to satellite phones the newest globalstar handset released in  does not include cellular connectivity as globalstar does not expect subscribers to carry it as their only mobile phone first generation satellitesedit globalstar orbits have an inclination of  degrees therefore globalstar does not cover polar areas due to the lower orbital inclination globalstar orbits have an orbital height of approximately  km and latency is still relatively low approximately ms a globalstar satellite has two bodymounted earthfacing arrays firstgeneration globalstars weigh approximately  kg however the secondgeneration globalstar design will gain significant mass in  some of the satellites began to reach the limit of their operational lifetime of  years in december  globalstar began to move some of its satellites into a graveyard orbit above leo firstgeneration satellite problemsedit according to documents filed with the sec on january   globalstars previously identified problems with its sband amplifiers used on its satellites for twoway communications are occurring at a higher rate than expected possibly eventually leading to reduced levels of twoway voice and duplex data service in  the companys simplex data services used to support the asset tracking products as well as the spot satellite messenger are not affected by the sband satellite issue mentioned above globalstar also launched eight ground spare satellites in  to help reduce the impact of the issue in the filing globalstar made the following statements based on data recently collected from satellite operations the company has concluded that the degradation of the amplifiers is now occurring at a rate that is faster than previously experienced and faster than the company had previously anticipated based on its most recent analysis the company now believes that if the degradation of the sband antenna amplifiers continues at the current rate or further accelerates and if the company is unsuccessful in developing additional technical solutions the quality of twoway communications services will decline and by some time in  substantially all of the company’s currently inorbit satellites will cease to be able to support twoway communications services  industry analysts speculate the problem is caused by radiation exposure the satellites receive when they pass through the south atlantic anomaly in their mile  km altitude orbits the sband antenna amplifier degradation does not affect adversely the company’s oneway “simplex” data transmission services which utilize only the lband uplink from a subscriber’s “simplex” terminal to the satellites the company is working on plans including new products and services and pricing programs and exploring the feasibility of accelerating procurement and launch of its secondgeneration satellite constellation to attempt to reduce the effects of this problem upon its customers and operations the company will be able to forecast the duration of service coverage at any particular location in its service area and intends to make this information available without charge to its service providers including its wholly owned operating subsidiaries so that they may work with their subscribers to reduce the impact of the degradation in service quality in their respective service areas the company is also reviewing its business plan in light of these developments the company’s liquidity remains strong at december   in addition to its credit agreement the company had unrestricted cash on hand and undrawn amounts under the thermo funding company irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement of approximately  million globalstars interim solutionedit in  globalstar launched eight spare satellites for its existing constellation with a view to reducing the gaps in its twoway voice and data services pending commercial availability of its secondgeneration satellite constellation scheduled for initial launch in the second half of  globalstar will continue to operate its existing satellite constellation to provide and support services until the secondgeneration globalstar satellites are available for service until the new secondgeneration globalstar satellite constellation is operational globalstar is offering its optimum satellite availability tool osat on its internet site which subscribers may use to predict when one or more unaffected satellites will be overhead at any specific geographic location to help customers deal with the sband communication issues globalstar has provided a call times tool which calculates optimum calling times for a given location secondgeneration satellitesedit in december  globalstar announced that alcatel alenia space now thales alenia space in its cannes headquarters has been awarded a € million contract for the secondgeneration constellation the satellites were designed with a life expectancy of  years significantly longer than the design life of globalstar’s firstgeneration constellation the second generation constellation will consist of  satellites in addition globalstar announced on april   that it has signed a € million agreement with thales alenia space to upgrade the globalstar satellite constellation including necessary hardware and software upgrades to globalstar’s satellite control network facilities in august  thales alenia space began production assembly integration and testing of the secondgeneration flight model satellites in its rome factory for launch as early as q  in july  globalstar inc announced that it has received complete financing for its secondgeneration satellite constellation and signed an amendment to the initial contract specifying in particular the adjusted conditions for production and the new satellite delivery timetable the first six secondgeneration satellites were launched on october   from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan the launch used a soyuz launch vehicle with a fregat upper stage these secondgeneration satellites are expected to provide globalstar customers with satellite voice and data services until at least  six more secondgeneration satellites were launched in july  followed by another six satellites in december  as of july    of  new satellites had been launched launch of the second generation constellation was completed february   with the launch of the final six satellites using a soyuz a launch vehicle the  secondgeneration spacecraft weighed approximately  kg  lb each at launch and are axis stabilized business operationsedit corporate structure and financingedit predecessor company  globalstar lp in february  globalstar telecommunications ltd raised  million from its initial public offering in the nasdaq market the ipo price of  per share was equivalent to  per share after two stock splits the stock price peaked at post split  per share in january  but institutional investors began predicting bankruptcy as early as june  the stock price eventually fell below  per share and the stock was delisted by nasdaq in june  after the ipo the publicly traded globalstar telecommunications nasdaq symbol gstrf owned part of system operator globalstar lp from that point on the primary financing for globalstar lp was vendor financing from its suppliers including loral and qualcomm supplemented by junk bonds after a total debt and equity investment of  billion on february   globalstar telecommunications filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection listing assets of  million and liabilities of  billion the assets were later bought for  million by thermo capital partners llc globalstar llc and globalstar inc when the new globalstar emerged from bankruptcy in april  it was owned by thermo capital partners  and the original creditors of globalstar lp  globalstar llc was incorporated in april  to become globalstar inc globalstar inc completed an ipo in november  the stock currently trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol gsat spot llcedit in august  globalstar announced the introduction of the spot satellite messenger product to be marketed through its latest subsidiary spot inc later named spot llc the spot messenger is manufactured by globalstar partner axonn llc and combines the companys simplex data technology with a nemerix gps chipset spot is intended to leverage globalstars still adequate lband uplink which is used by simplex modems the product was launched early november  employeesedit the first five employees of globalstar were transferred from the founding companies in  although few figures were publicly disclosed the company apparently reached a peak of about  employees until layoffs in march  however this figure was misleading as most of the development operations and sales employees were employed by the company’s strategic partnerscitation needed lorals chairman bernard schwartz served as

around the world including  in north america globalstar gateways are the largest cellular base stations in the world with a design capacity for over  concurrent phone calls over a coverage area that is roughly  of the size of the usa globalstar supports cdma technology such as the rake receiver and soft handoffs so a handset may be talking via two spot beams to two gateways for path diversity globalstar users are assigned telephone numbers on the north american numbering plan in north america or the appropriate telephone numbering plan for the country that the overseas gateway is located in except for brazil where the official globalstar country code  is used the use of gateway ground stations provides customers with localized regional phone numbers for their satellite handsets but if there are no gateway stations to cover certain remote areas such as areas of the south pacific and the polar regions service cannot be provided in these remote areas even if the satellites may fly over them as of may  voice and fullduplex data service is currently nonfunctional over much of africa the south asian subcontinent and most midocean regions due to lack of nearby gateway earth stations the globalstar system uses the qualcomm cdma air interface however the ericsson and telit phones accept standard gsm sim cards while the qualcomm gsp phones do not have a sim card interface but use cdmais based authentication therefore the globalstar gateways need to support both the cdmais and the gsm standards globalstar has roaming agreements with local cellular operators in some regions enabling the use of a single phone number in satellite and cellular mode on multimode globalstar handsets these cellular roaming agreements are not in place in north america because of improvements in cellular phones and networks and the limitations inherent to satellite phones the newest globalstar handset released in  does not include cellular connectivity as globalstar does not

eventually leading to reduced levels of twoway voice and duplex data service in  the companys simplex data services used to support the asset tracking products as well as the spot satellite messenger are not affected by the sband satellite issue mentioned above globalstar also launched eight ground spare satellites in  to help reduce the impact of the issue in the filing globalstar made the following statements based on data recently collected from satellite operations the company has concluded that the degradation of the amplifiers is now occurring at a rate that is faster than previously experienced and faster than the company had previously anticipated based on its most recent analysis the company now believes that if the degradation of the sband antenna amplifiers continues at the current rate or further accelerates and if the company is unsuccessful in developing additional technical solutions the quality of twoway communications services will decline and by some time in  substantially all of the company’s currently inorbit satellites will cease to be able to support twoway communications services  industry analysts speculate the problem is caused by radiation exposure the satellites receive when they pass through the south atlantic anomaly in their mile  km altitude orbits the sband antenna amplifier degradation does not affect adversely the company’s oneway “simplex” data transmission services which utilize only the lband uplink from a subscriber’s “simplex” terminal to the satellites the company is working on plans including new products and services and pricing programs and exploring the feasibility of accelerating procurement and launch of its secondgeneration satellite constellation to attempt to reduce the effects of this problem upon its customers and operations the company will be able to forecast the duration of service coverage at any particular location in its service area and intends to make this information

partnership established in the us with financial participation from eight other companies including alcatel airtouch deutsche aerospace hyundai and vodafone at that time the company predicted the system would launch in  based on an investment of  billion globalstar received its us spectrum allocation from the fcc in january  and continued to negotiate with other nations for rights to use the same radio frequencies in their countries the first satellites were launched in february  but system deployment was delayed due to a launch failure in september  that resulted in the loss of  satellites in a launch by the russian space agency in february  it launched the last of  satellites— satellites and four inorbit spares another eight unlaunched satellites were maintained as ground spares the first call on the original globalstar system was placed on november   from qualcomm chairman irwin jacobs in san diego to loral space  communications ceo and chairman bernard schwartz in new york city in october  the system began friendly user trials with  of  planned satellites in december  the system began limited commercial service for  users with the full  satellites no spares in orbit in february  it began full commercial service with its  satellites and  spares in north america europe and brazil initial prices were minute on february   the predecessor company globalstar old globalstar and three of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under chapter  of the united states bankruptcy code in  restructuring of the old globalstar was completed the first stage of the restructuring was completed on december   when thermo capital partners llc was deemed to obtain operational control of the business as well as certain ownership rights and risks thermo capital partners became the principal owner globalstar llc was formed as a delaware limited liability company in november  and was converted into globalstar inc on march   in  globalstar launched eight additional firstgeneration spare satellites into space to help compensate for the premature failure of their inorbit satellites between  and  globalstar launched  secondgeneration satellites in an effort to restore their system to full service between  and  globalstar moved its headquarters from silicon valley to covington louisiana in part to take advantage of the states tax breaks and low cost of living products and servicesedit globalstar is a provider of mobile satellite voice and data services globalstar offers these services to commercial and recreational users in more than  countries around the world the companys products include mobile and fixed satellite telephones simplex and duplex satellite data modems and satellite airtime packages in late  globalstar subsidiary spot llc launched a handheld satellite messaging and tracking personal safety device known as the spot satellite messenger many land based and maritime industries make use of the various globalstar products and services from remote areas beyond the reach of cellular and landline telephone service global customer segments include oil and gas government mining forestry commercial fishing utilities military transportation heavy construction emergency preparedness and business continuity as well as individual recreational users globalstar data solutions are used for a variety of asset and

geolocation within approximately  km system architectureedit gatewaysedit globalstar satellites are simple bent pipe analog repeaters unlike iridium a network of ground gateway stations provides connectivity from the  satellites to the public switched telephone network and internet a satellite must have a gateway station in view to provide service to any users it may see twenty four globalstar gateways are located around the world including  in north america globalstar gateways are the largest cellular base stations in the world with a design capacity for over  concurrent phone calls over a coverage area that is roughly  of the size of the usa globalstar supports cdma technology such as the rake receiver and soft handoffs so a handset may be talking via two spot beams to two gateways for path diversity globalstar users are assigned telephone numbers on the north american numbering plan in north america or the appropriate telephone numbering plan for the country that the overseas gateway is located in except for brazil where the official globalstar country code  is used the use of gateway ground stations provides customers with localized regional phone numbers for their satellite handsets but if there are no gateway stations to cover certain remote areas such as areas of the south pacific and the polar regions service cannot be provided in these remote areas even if the satellites may fly over them as of may  voice and fullduplex data service is currently nonfunctional over much of africa the south asian subcontinent and most midocean regions due to lack of nearby gateway earth stations the globalstar system uses the qualcomm cdma air interface however the ericsson and telit phones accept standard gsm sim cards while the qualcomm gsp phones do not have a sim card interface but use cdmais based authentication therefore the globalstar gateways need to support both the cdmais and the gsm standards globalstar has roaming agreements with local cellular operators in some regions enabling the use of a single phone number in satellite and cellular mode on multimode globalstar handsets these cellular roaming agreements are not in place in north america because of improvements in cellular phones and networks and the limitations inherent to satellite phones the newest globalstar handset released in  does not include cellular connectivity as globalstar does not expect subscribers to carry it as their only mobile phone first generation satellitesedit globalstar orbits have an inclination of  degrees therefore globalstar does not cover polar areas due to the lower orbital inclination globalstar orbits have an orbital height of approximately  km and latency is still relatively low approximately ms a globalstar satellite has two bodymounted earthfacing arrays firstgeneration globalstars weigh approximately  kg however the secondgeneration globalstar design will gain significant mass in  some of the satellites began to reach the limit of their operational lifetime of  years in december  globalstar began to move some of its satellites into a graveyard orbit above leo firstgeneration satellite problemsedit according to documents filed with the sec on january   globalstars previously identified problems with its sband amplifiers used on its satellites for twoway communications are occurring at a higher rate than expected possibly eventually leading to reduced levels of twoway voice and duplex data service in  the companys simplex data services used to support the asset tracking products as well as the spot satellite messenger are not affected by the sband satellite issue mentioned above globalstar also launched eight ground spare satellites in  to help reduce the impact of the issue in the filing globalstar made the following statements based on data recently collected from satellite operations the company has concluded that the degradation of the amplifiers is now occurring at a rate that is faster than previously experienced and faster than the company had previously anticipated based on its most recent analysis the company now believes that if the degradation of the sband antenna amplifiers continues at the current rate or further accelerates and if the company is unsuccessful in developing additional technical solutions the quality of twoway communications services will decline and by some time in  substantially all of the company’s currently inorbit satellites will cease to be able to support twoway communications services  industry analysts speculate the problem is caused by radiation exposure the satellites receive when they pass through the south atlantic anomaly in their mile  km altitude orbits the sband antenna amplifier degradation does not affect adversely the company’s oneway “simplex” data transmission services which utilize only the lband uplink from a subscriber’s “simplex” terminal to the satellites the company is working on plans including new products and services and pricing programs and exploring the feasibility of accelerating procurement and launch of its secondgeneration satellite constellation to attempt to reduce the effects of this problem upon its customers and operations the company will be able to forecast the duration of service coverage at any particular location in its service area and intends to make this information available without charge to its service providers including its wholly owned operating subsidiaries so that they may work with their subscribers to reduce the impact of the degradation in service quality in their respective service areas the company is also reviewing its business plan in light of these developments the company’s liquidity remains strong at december   in addition to its credit agreement the company had unrestricted cash on hand and undrawn amounts under the thermo funding company irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement of approximately  million globalstars interim solutionedit in  globalstar launched eight spare satellites for its existing constellation with a view to reducing the gaps in its twoway voice and data services pending commercial availability of its secondgeneration satellite constellation scheduled for initial launch in the second half of  globalstar will continue to operate its existing satellite constellation to provide and support services until the secondgeneration globalstar satellites are available for service until the new secondgeneration globalstar satellite constellation is operational globalstar is offering its optimum satellite availability tool osat on its internet site which subscribers may use to predict when one or more unaffected satellites will be overhead at any specific geographic location to help customers deal with the sband communication issues globalstar has provided a call times tool which calculates optimum calling times for a given location secondgeneration satellitesedit in december  globalstar announced that alcatel alenia space now thales alenia space in its cannes headquarters has been awarded a € million contract for the secondgeneration constellation the satellites were designed with a life expectancy of  years significantly longer than the design life of globalstar’s firstgeneration constellation the second generation constellation will consist of  satellites in addition globalstar announced on april   that it has signed a € million agreement with thales alenia space to upgrade the globalstar satellite constellation including necessary hardware and software upgrades to globalstar’s satellite control network facilities in august  thales alenia space began production assembly integration and testing of the secondgeneration flight model satellites in its rome factory for launch as early as q  in july  globalstar inc announced that it has received complete financing for its secondgeneration satellite constellation and signed an amendment to the initial contract specifying in particular the adjusted conditions for production and the new satellite delivery timetable the first six secondgeneration satellites were launched on october   from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan the launch used a soyuz launch vehicle with a fregat upper stage these secondgeneration satellites are expected to provide globalstar customers with satellite voice and data services until at least  six more secondgeneration satellites were launched in july  followed by another six satellites in december  as of july    of  new satellites had been launched launch of the second generation constellation was completed february   with the launch of the final six satellites using a soyuz a launch vehicle the  secondgeneration spacecraft weighed approximately  kg  lb each at launch and are axis stabilized business operationsedit corporate structure and financingedit predecessor company  globalstar lp in february  globalstar telecommunications ltd raised  million from its initial public offering in the nasdaq market the ipo price of  per share was equivalent to  per share after two stock splits the stock price peaked at post split  per share in january  but institutional investors began predicting bankruptcy as early as june  the stock price eventually fell below  per share and the stock was delisted by nasdaq in june  after the ipo the publicly traded globalstar telecommunications nasdaq symbol gstrf owned part of system operator globalstar lp from that point on the primary financing for globalstar lp was vendor financing from its suppliers including loral and qualcomm supplemented by junk bonds after a total debt and equity investment of  billion on february   globalstar telecommunications filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection listing assets of  million and liabilities of  billion the assets were later bought for  million by thermo capital partners llc globalstar llc and globalstar inc when the new globalstar emerged from bankruptcy in april  it was owned by thermo capital partners  and the original creditors of globalstar lp  globalstar llc was incorporated in april  to become globalstar inc globalstar inc completed an ipo in november  the stock currently trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol gsat spot llcedit in august  globalstar announced the introduction of the spot satellite messenger product to be marketed through its latest subsidiary spot inc later named spot llc the spot messenger is manufactured by globalstar partner axonn llc and combines the companys simplex data technology with a nemerix gps chipset spot is intended to leverage globalstars still adequate lband uplink which is used by simplex modems the product was launched early november  employeesedit the first five employees of globalstar were transferred from the founding companies in  although few figures were publicly disclosed the company apparently reached a peak of about  employees until layoffs in march  however this figure was misleading as most of the development operations and sales employees were employed by the company’s strategic partnerscitation needed lorals chairman bernard schwartz served as

including alcatel airtouch deutsche aerospace hyundai and vodafone at that time the company predicted the system would launch in  based on an investment of  billion globalstar received its us spectrum allocation from the fcc in january  and continued to negotiate with other nations for rights to use the same radio frequencies in their countries the first satellites were launched in february  but system deployment was delayed due to a launch failure in september  that resulted in the loss of  satellites in a launch by the russian space agency in february  it launched the last of  satellites— satellites and four inorbit spares another eight unlaunched satellites were maintained as ground spares the first call on the original globalstar system was placed on november   from qualcomm chairman irwin jacobs in san diego to loral space  communications ceo and chairman bernard schwartz in new york city in october  the system began friendly user trials with  of  planned satellites in december  the system began limited commercial service for  users with the full  satellites no spares in orbit in february  it began full commercial service with its  satellites and  spares in north america europe and brazil initial prices were minute on february   the predecessor company globalstar old globalstar and three of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under chapter  of the united states bankruptcy code in  restructuring of the old globalstar was completed the first stage of the restructuring was completed on december   when thermo capital partners llc was deemed to obtain operational control of the business as well as certain ownership rights and risks thermo capital partners became the principal owner globalstar llc was formed as a delaware limited liability company in november  and was converted into globalstar inc on march   in  globalstar launched eight additional firstgeneration spare satellites into space to help compensate for the premature failure of their inorbit satellites between  and  globalstar launched  secondgeneration satellites in an effort to restore their system to full service between  and  globalstar moved its headquarters from silicon valley to

originated shortburst messages simplex devices only device geolocation within approximately  km system architectureedit gatewaysedit globalstar satellites are simple bent pipe analog repeaters unlike iridium a network of ground gateway stations provides connectivity from the  satellites to the public switched telephone network and internet a satellite must have a gateway station in view to provide service to any users it may see twenty four globalstar gateways are located around the world including  in north america globalstar gateways are the largest cellular base stations in the world with a design capacity for over  concurrent phone calls over a coverage area that is roughly  of the size of the usa globalstar supports cdma technology such as the rake receiver and soft handoffs so a handset may be talking via two spot beams to two gateways for path diversity globalstar users are assigned telephone numbers on the north american numbering plan in north america or the appropriate telephone numbering plan for the country that the overseas gateway is located in except for brazil where the official globalstar country code  is used the use of gateway ground stations provides customers with localized regional phone numbers for their satellite handsets but if there are no gateway stations to cover certain remote areas such as areas of the south pacific and the polar regions service cannot be provided in these remote areas even if the satellites may fly over them as of may  voice and fullduplex data service is currently nonfunctional over much of africa the south asian subcontinent and most midocean regions due to lack of nearby gateway earth stations the globalstar system uses the qualcomm cdma air interface however the ericsson and telit phones accept standard gsm sim cards while the qualcomm gsp phones do not have a sim card interface but use cdmais based authentication therefore the globalstar gateways need to support both the cdmais and the gsm standards globalstar has roaming agreements with local cellular operators in some regions enabling the use of a single phone number in satellite and cellular mode on multimode globalstar handsets these cellular roaming agreements are not in place in north america because of improvements in cellular phones and networks and the limitations inherent to satellite phones the newest globalstar handset released in  does not include cellular connectivity as globalstar does not expect subscribers to carry it as their only mobile phone first generation satellitesedit globalstar orbits have an inclination of  degrees therefore globalstar does not cover polar areas due to the lower orbital inclination globalstar orbits have an orbital height of approximately  km and latency is still relatively low approximately ms a globalstar satellite has two bodymounted earthfacing arrays firstgeneration globalstars weigh approximately  kg however the secondgeneration globalstar design will gain significant mass in  some of the satellites began to reach the limit of their operational lifetime of  years in december  globalstar began to move some of its satellites into a graveyard orbit above leo firstgeneration satellite problemsedit according to documents filed with the sec on january   globalstars previously identified problems with its sband amplifiers used on its satellites for twoway communications are occurring at a higher rate than expected possibly eventually leading to reduced levels of twoway voice and duplex data service in  the companys simplex data services used to support the asset tracking products as well as the spot satellite messenger are not affected by the sband satellite issue mentioned above globalstar also launched eight ground spare satellites in  to help reduce the impact of the issue in the filing globalstar made the following statements based on data recently collected from satellite operations the company has concluded that the degradation of the amplifiers is now occurring at a rate that is faster than previously experienced and faster than the company had previously anticipated based on its most recent analysis the company now believes that if the degradation of the sband antenna amplifiers continues at the current rate or further accelerates and if the company is unsuccessful in developing additional technical solutions the quality of twoway communications services will decline and by some time in  substantially all of the company’s currently inorbit satellites will cease to be able to support twoway communications services  industry analysts speculate the problem is caused by radiation exposure the satellites receive when they pass through the south atlantic anomaly in their mile  km altitude orbits the sband antenna amplifier degradation does not affect adversely the company’s oneway “simplex” data transmission services which utilize only the lband uplink from a subscriber’s “simplex” terminal to the satellites the company is working on plans including new products and services and pricing programs and exploring the feasibility of accelerating procurement and launch of its secondgeneration satellite constellation to attempt to reduce the effects of this problem upon its customers and operations the company will be able to forecast the duration of service coverage at any particular location in its service area and intends to make this information available without charge to its service providers including its wholly owned operating subsidiaries so that they may work with their subscribers to reduce the impact of the degradation in service quality in their respective service areas the company is also reviewing its business plan in light of these developments the company’s liquidity remains strong at december   in addition to its credit agreement the company had unrestricted cash on hand and undrawn amounts under the thermo funding company irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement of approximately  million globalstars interim solutionedit in  globalstar launched eight spare satellites for its existing constellation with a view to reducing the gaps in its twoway voice and data services pending commercial availability of its secondgeneration satellite constellation scheduled for initial launch in the second half of  globalstar will continue to operate its existing satellite constellation to provide and support services until the secondgeneration globalstar satellites are available for service until the new secondgeneration globalstar satellite constellation is operational globalstar is offering its optimum satellite availability tool osat on its internet site which subscribers may use to predict when one or more unaffected satellites will be overhead at any specific geographic location to help customers deal with the sband communication issues globalstar has provided a call times tool which calculates optimum calling times for a given location secondgeneration satellitesedit in december  globalstar announced that alcatel alenia space now thales alenia space in its cannes headquarters has been awarded a € million contract for the secondgeneration constellation the satellites were designed with a life expectancy of  years significantly longer than the design life of globalstar’s firstgeneration constellation the second generation constellation will consist of  satellites in addition globalstar announced on april   that it has signed a € million agreement with thales alenia space to upgrade the globalstar satellite constellation including necessary hardware and software upgrades to globalstar’s satellite control network facilities in august  thales alenia space began production assembly integration and testing of the secondgeneration flight model satellites in its rome factory for launch as early as q  in july  globalstar inc announced that it has received complete financing for its secondgeneration satellite constellation and signed an amendment to the initial contract specifying in particular the adjusted conditions for production and the new satellite delivery timetable the first six secondgeneration satellites were launched on october   from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan the launch used a soyuz launch vehicle with a fregat upper stage these secondgeneration satellites are expected to provide globalstar customers with satellite voice and data services until at least  six more secondgeneration satellites were launched in july  followed by another six satellites in december  as of july    of  new satellites had been launched launch of the second generation constellation was completed february   with the launch of the final six satellites using a soyuz a launch

lp a limited partnership established in the us with financial participation from eight other companies including alcatel airtouch deutsche aerospace hyundai and vodafone at that time the company predicted the system would launch in  based on an investment of  billion globalstar received its us spectrum allocation from the fcc in january  and continued to negotiate with other nations for rights to use the same radio frequencies in their countries the first satellites were launched in february  but system deployment was delayed due to a launch failure in september  that resulted in the loss of  satellites in a launch by the russian space agency in february  it launched the last of  satellites— satellites and four inorbit spares another eight unlaunched satellites were maintained as ground spares the first call on the original globalstar system was placed on november   from qualcomm chairman irwin jacobs in san diego to loral space  communications ceo and chairman bernard schwartz in new york city in october  the system began friendly user trials with  of  planned satellites in december  the system began limited commercial service for  users with the full  satellites no spares in orbit in february  it began full commercial service with its  satellites and  spares in north america europe and brazil initial prices were minute on february   the predecessor company globalstar old globalstar and three of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under chapter  of the united states bankruptcy code in  restructuring of the old globalstar was completed the first stage of the restructuring was completed on december   when thermo capital partners llc was deemed to obtain operational control of the business as well as certain ownership rights and risks thermo capital partners became the principal owner globalstar llc was formed as a delaware limited liability company in november  and was converted into globalstar inc on march   in  globalstar launched eight additional firstgeneration spare satellites into space to help compensate for the premature failure of their inorbit satellites between  and  globalstar launched  secondgeneration satellites in an effort to restore their system to full service between  and  globalstar moved its headquarters from silicon valley to covington louisiana in part to take advantage of the states tax breaks and low cost of living products and servicesedit globalstar is a provider of mobile satellite voice and data services globalstar offers these services to commercial and recreational users in more than  countries around the world the companys products include mobile and fixed satellite telephones simplex and duplex satellite data modems and satellite airtime packages in late  globalstar subsidiary spot llc launched a handheld satellite messaging and tracking personal safety device known as the spot satellite messenger many land based and maritime industries make use of the various globalstar products and services from remote areas beyond the reach of cellular and landline telephone service global customer segments include oil and gas government mining forestry commercial fishing utilities military transportation heavy construction emergency preparedness and business continuity as well as individual recreational users globalstar data solutions are used for a variety of asset and

geolocation within approximately  km system architectureedit gatewaysedit globalstar satellites are simple bent pipe analog repeaters unlike iridium a network of ground gateway stations provides connectivity from the  satellites to the public switched telephone network and internet a satellite must have a gateway station in view to provide service to any users it may see twenty four globalstar gateways are located around the world including  in north america globalstar gateways are the largest cellular base stations in the world with a design capacity for over  concurrent phone calls over a coverage area that is roughly  of the size of the usa globalstar supports cdma technology such as the rake receiver and soft handoffs so a handset may be talking via two spot beams to two gateways for path diversity globalstar users are assigned telephone numbers on the north american numbering plan in north america or the appropriate telephone numbering plan for the country that the overseas gateway is located in except for brazil where the official globalstar country code  is used the use of gateway ground stations provides customers with localized regional phone numbers for their satellite handsets but if there are no gateway stations to cover certain remote areas such as areas of the south pacific and the polar regions service cannot be provided in these remote areas even if the satellites may fly over them as of may  voice and fullduplex data service is currently nonfunctional over much of africa the south asian subcontinent and most midocean regions due to lack of nearby gateway earth stations the globalstar system uses the qualcomm cdma air interface however the ericsson and telit phones accept standard gsm sim cards while the qualcomm gsp phones do not have a sim card interface but use cdmais based authentication therefore the globalstar gateways need to support both the cdmais and the gsm standards globalstar has roaming agreements with local cellular operators in some regions enabling the use of a single phone number in satellite and cellular mode on multimode globalstar handsets these cellular roaming agreements are not in place in north america because of improvements in cellular phones and networks and the limitations inherent to satellite phones the newest globalstar handset released in  does not include cellular connectivity as globalstar does not expect subscribers to carry it as their only mobile phone first generation satellitesedit globalstar orbits have an inclination of  degrees therefore globalstar does not cover polar areas due to the lower orbital inclination globalstar orbits have an orbital height of approximately  km and latency is still relatively low approximately ms a globalstar satellite has two bodymounted earthfacing arrays firstgeneration globalstars weigh approximately  kg however the secondgeneration globalstar design will gain significant mass in  some of the satellites began to reach the limit of their operational lifetime of  years in december  globalstar began to move some of its satellites into a graveyard orbit above leo firstgeneration satellite problemsedit according to documents filed with the sec on january   globalstars previously identified problems with its sband amplifiers used on its satellites for twoway communications are occurring at a higher rate than expected possibly eventually leading to reduced levels of twoway voice and duplex data service in  the companys simplex data services used to support the asset tracking products as well as the spot satellite messenger are not affected by the sband satellite issue mentioned above globalstar also launched eight ground spare satellites in  to help reduce the impact of the issue in the filing globalstar made the following statements based on data recently collected from satellite operations the company has concluded that the degradation of the amplifiers is now occurring at a rate that is faster than previously experienced and faster than the company had previously anticipated based on its most recent analysis the company now believes that if the degradation of the sband antenna amplifiers continues at the current rate or further accelerates and if the company is unsuccessful in developing additional technical solutions the quality of twoway communications services will decline and by some time in  substantially all of the company’s currently inorbit satellites will cease to be able to support twoway communications services  industry analysts speculate the problem is caused by radiation exposure the satellites receive when they pass through the south atlantic anomaly in their mile  km altitude orbits the sband antenna amplifier degradation does not affect adversely the company’s oneway “simplex” data transmission services which utilize only the lband uplink from a subscriber’s “simplex” terminal to the satellites the company is working on plans including new products and services and pricing programs and exploring the feasibility of accelerating procurement and launch of its secondgeneration satellite constellation to attempt to reduce the effects of this problem upon its customers and operations the company will be able to forecast the duration of service coverage at any particular location in its service area and intends to make this information available without charge to its service providers including its wholly owned operating subsidiaries so that they may work with their subscribers to reduce the impact of the degradation in service quality in their respective service areas the company is also reviewing its business plan in light of these developments the company’s liquidity remains strong at december   in addition to its credit agreement the company had unrestricted cash on hand and undrawn amounts under the thermo funding company irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement of approximately  million globalstars interim solutionedit in  globalstar launched eight spare satellites for its existing constellation with a view to reducing the gaps in its twoway voice and data services pending commercial availability of its secondgeneration satellite constellation scheduled for initial launch in the second half of  globalstar will continue to operate its existing satellite constellation to provide and support services until the secondgeneration globalstar satellites are available for service until the new secondgeneration globalstar satellite constellation is operational globalstar is offering its optimum satellite availability tool osat on its internet site which subscribers may use to predict when one or more unaffected satellites will be overhead at any specific geographic location to help customers deal with the sband communication issues globalstar has provided a call times tool which calculates optimum calling times for a given location secondgeneration satellitesedit in december  globalstar announced that alcatel alenia space now thales alenia space in its cannes headquarters has been awarded a € million contract for the secondgeneration constellation the satellites were designed with a life expectancy of  years significantly longer than the design life of globalstar’s firstgeneration constellation the second generation constellation will consist of  satellites in addition globalstar announced on april   that it has signed a € million agreement with thales alenia space to upgrade the globalstar satellite constellation including necessary hardware and software upgrades to globalstar’s satellite control network facilities in august  thales alenia space began production assembly integration and testing of the secondgeneration flight model satellites in its rome factory for launch as early as q  in july  globalstar inc announced that it has received complete financing for its secondgeneration satellite constellation and signed an amendment to the initial contract specifying in particular the adjusted conditions for production and the new satellite delivery timetable the first six secondgeneration satellites were launched on october   from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan the launch used a soyuz launch vehicle with a fregat upper stage these secondgeneration satellites are expected to provide globalstar customers with satellite voice and data services until at least  six more secondgeneration satellites were launched in july  followed by another six satellites in december  as of july    of  new satellites had been launched launch of the second generation constellation was completed february   with the launch of the final six satellites using a soyuz a launch vehicle the  secondgeneration spacecraft weighed approximately  kg  lb each at launch and are axis stabilized business operationsedit corporate structure and financingedit predecessor company  globalstar lp in february  globalstar telecommunications ltd raised  million from its initial public offering in the nasdaq market the ipo price of  per share was equivalent to  per share after two stock splits the stock price peaked at post split  per share in january  but institutional investors began predicting bankruptcy as early as june  the stock price eventually fell below  per share and the stock was delisted by nasdaq in june  after the ipo the publicly traded globalstar telecommunications nasdaq symbol gstrf owned part of system operator globalstar lp from that point on the primary financing for globalstar lp was vendor financing from its suppliers including loral and qualcomm supplemented by junk bonds after a total debt and equity investment of  billion on february   globalstar telecommunications filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection listing assets of  million and liabilities of  billion the assets were later bought for  million by thermo capital partners llc globalstar llc and globalstar inc when the new globalstar emerged from bankruptcy in april  it was owned by thermo capital partners  and the original creditors of globalstar lp  globalstar llc was incorporated in april  to become globalstar inc globalstar inc completed an ipo in november  the stock currently trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol gsat spot llcedit in august  globalstar announced the introduction of the spot satellite messenger product to be marketed through its latest subsidiary spot inc later named spot llc the spot messenger is manufactured by globalstar partner axonn llc and combines the companys simplex data technology with a nemerix gps chipset spot is intended to leverage globalstars still adequate lband uplink which is used by simplex modems the product was launched early november  employeesedit the first five employees of globalstar were transferred from the founding companies in  although few figures were publicly disclosed the company apparently reached a peak of about  employees until layoffs in march  however this figure was misleading as most of the development operations and sales employees were employed by the company’s strategic partnerscitation needed lorals chairman bernard schwartz served as
