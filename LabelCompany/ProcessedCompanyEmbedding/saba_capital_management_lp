its investment performance largely depends on the investment performance of the underlying funds in which it invests and the fund is subject to the risks associated with the underlying funds leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause fluctuations in the market value of the funds portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the nav of the fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions amplifying risks the fund may engage in writing covered call options which may limit its opportunity to profit from an increase in the price of the underlying stock above the exercise price but continues to bear the risk of a decline in the stock a liquid market may not exist for options held by the fund while the fund receives premiums for writing the call options the price it realizes from the exercise of an option could be substantially below a stocks current market price highyield bonds have a higher risk
