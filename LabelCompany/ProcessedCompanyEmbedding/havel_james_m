home about havels inc news  events contact us  us  canada           international welcome to havels try our low priced echostimž for freesafer more effective peripheral nerve blocks are also more affordable with havels market leading echostimž echogenic insulated needles the echostimž has  rows of  bright reflectors near the tip to help you identify the needle under ultrasound and most say they are priced  or  less than our competitors needlesthe echostimž x reflector pattern puts  reflectors in the first mm of the needle this allows you focus on the tip which is the most important part of the needle other needles have reflectors as far as mm up the shaft which adds to the price and could lead to a false assumption as to the tips location if the actual tip is somehow obscured or out of plane an abundance of reflectors could also cause a cloud or halo around the needle which in some cases could possibly blur the target dont pay for reflectors you dont need instead focus
