utility commission puc for status as a public utility which would have granted it power to seize property for its pipeline via eminent domain in may  the puc voted to confer public utility status in a split  decision but the decision was controversial and an official declaration was not made at the time in july the puc officially reconsidered its decision after receiving negative feedback from the public including the pennsylvania independent oil and gas association pioga in september laser withdrew it’s application saying its business model had changed at that point laser had finalized all of the agreements necessary to complete the pipeline and would not need eminent domain power see this mdn story in november not much more than a month ago the puc voted to approve laser’s application
