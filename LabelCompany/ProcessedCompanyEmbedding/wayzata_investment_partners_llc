local  financial secretary said â€œthey supported us in our rallies at wayzata headquarters in minnesota and at the plant gateâ€ the union was successful in regaining main provisions of their former

with us the contract we obtained addresses most of our issuesâ€ one of the most important provisions the union obtained is successorship if wayzata sells the pulp mill in the future the new owner would have to abide by the existing union contract for the term of the agreement and workers would get to keep their jobs since there was not a successorship clause in the old pope  talbot contract the workers lost their jobs and had to reapply for them under the terms offered by the new owner workers will receive a minimum  percent wage increase immediately upon ratification and will be paid the difference between their old wage rate and the new one for the five months they were without a contract on november  in  and  they will receive a  percent general wage increase in   and  on november  their wage increase will be based on the average of wage increases negotiated at other pacific coast mills the company agreed to pay a cent per hour shift differential for the  pm to  am shift after ratification instead of its original proposal to start payment in  an additional cents per hour will be added nov   instead of a year later the shift to earlier payment is significant because this provision affects about  percent of the membership prior to the new agreement workers had to pay  percent of their health care premiums in the new agreement workers will immediately pay  percent of the cost this increases to  percent in  and  percent in  local  was able to retrieve all the contract language under the old contract with pope  talbot except for a few minor modifications

were not paid if they were overlooked for overtime because managers did not follow seniority if a manager disregards seniority now when assigning overtime the overlooked person who should have been assigned it will get paid as if the manager had not messed up the defined benefit pension workers had under pope  talbot will be replaced by a usw k plan cascade pacific will match up to  percent of a
