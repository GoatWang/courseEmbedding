complaints personally some people might not like the lack of handholding that comes along with having a group of such driven accomplished capable people working at the company dont work here if you

and certainly not at your average company google maybe everyones just really really smart youll find experts in a wide range of fields engineering scientific and otherwise and pretty much everyone ive met is helpful and willing to talk to you no there isnt much structure but isnt that a good thing you just have to take initiative to figure out whats needed and how you can contribute ive seen people given pretty big new responsibilities just because they showed an interest and that they could handle it not saying it always works out but how many places is something like that even a possibility plus the projects an important one designing new drugs and improving how drugs are designed and they pay very well i really dont get what other reviewers are grousing about how many jobs give you great pay supersmart coworkers a good mission and minimal dilbertlike corporate bs to ruin your dayconsno job is perfect and if you want something to be unhappy about youll find something yes some of the managers are probably better engineers or chemists than they are managers so the management part of their job can get neglected but id rather pay that price than work under a bunch of people who are professional middlemanagers but lousy engineers or mediocre scientists or just not very intelligentadvice to managementits an unusual environment and judging by some of the reviews on here not everyone is prepared to get the most out of it maybe take more pains during the hiring process to explain what its like so people who arent going to like it have a chance to opt out rather than coming and being unhappy clearly for the right people it works out great it cant be an accident that there are so many people whove been here  yearsshare on facebookshare on twittershare on whatsappshare via

appears to be no functioning mechanism to remove toxic managers and they are poisoning the organization turnover is highdo your homework because funding is essentially infinite there is no real existential drive to avoid mistakes there is a culture of backbiting almost every day you will hear someone trash anothers work sometimes with glee though some of the technology is cutting edge other parts of it are maddeningly archaic advice as a candidate you should talk to former employees and have a plan b if desres doesnt work out ensure you know what you will do from a career and financial
