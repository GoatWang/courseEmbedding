billion in longshort assets across both market neutral and  implementations acadian launched the global leveraged market neutral strategy in  focusing on leveraged investing in long and short equity positions across the developed and emerging markets market neutral acadians market neutral strategies are focused on absolute risk and return seeking maximum exposure to the stock selection return factors that we believe are likely to deliver the desired excess return  the strategy provides diversification in a broader portfolio of global investments with the goal of offering uncorrelated risk and returns  market neutral strategies target a net beta neutral exposure in an effort to avoid the effects of unrewarded systematic risks in these portfolios leveraged acadians global leveraged market neutral strategy much like our other longshort implementations holds long and short positions across all capitalization ranges in developed and emerging markets the global leveraged market neutral strategy is also generally betaneutral in an effort to avoid exposure to unrewarded systematic risks the strategy offers the same broad diversification and focus on the stock selection return factors we believe are likely to deliver the desired excess return the main differentiating factor is the use of leverage within the strategy in an effort to amplify returns from stock selection  acadians  strategies reflect the belief that our ability to add value as an investment manager is derived from our ability to apply our stock selection process across the broadest possible universe of global stocks this strategy seeks to increase returns by taking short positions of  of the portfolio value in the least attractive securities as identified by acadians stock forecast model and uses the proceeds of the short sales to increase long positions in the most attractive securities we offer a variety of implementations of the  strategy across capitalization size ranges regional variations and differing degrees of short exposure eg  white papers video commentary fact sheets terms and conditions of use dont agree i agree agree to terms and conditions please carefully read the
