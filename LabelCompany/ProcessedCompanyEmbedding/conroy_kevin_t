third wave and served in that position until the company’s acquisition by hologic in  he joined third wave in  and functioned as the company’s general counsel prior to third wave conroy was the

intellectual property litigator in private practice in chicago conroy earned a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from michigan state university as well as a law degree from the university of michigan law school company brief exact sciences corp exactsciencescom is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection of colorectal cancer the company has exclusive intellectual property protecting its convenient noninvasive stoolbased dna technology for the detection of colorectal cancer how has exact sciences evolved from its inception exact was founded in the mids by stan lapidus a brilliant entrepreneurial scientist who saw three of his companies go public his notion was that by screening for colon cancer noninvasively you could move colon cancer to where cervical cancer is which has been largely eradicated among women who are regularly screened with the pap smear he took the early learnings from dna mutations in colon cancer cells and determined that you could look for those mutations in a patient’s stool sample the early work was focused on screening the stool sample looking for dna mutations that would indicate whether the patient had cancer or precancerous polyps but the early dna detection technology didn’t perform well enough to be an effective screening tool in  the company was not in good shape it had laid off almost all of its employees and had a small amount of capital but had strong patents and a board committed to the longterm success of eradicating colorectal cancer the board recruited me to join the company at that time and i saw a real opportunity to rebuild exact sciences i was inspired by a visit to the mayo clinic where i saw work showing that with different biomarkers and detection technologies you could detect up to  percent or more of cancers and half of small precancerous polyps maneesh arora exact’s coo and i set about rebuilding the company implementing a new vision for a path forward and developing a new scientific team as well as a test that detected  percent of colon cancers noninvasively and a majority of the large precancerous polyps most likely to develop into cancer since  we have built the company laid out the vision created a test and run a huge successful clinical trial at the end of march we had a panel meeting with the fda where the advisory committee reviewed all of the data from the clinical trial and we are hopeful that the fda will approve cologuard research scientist tanya quint works to process cologuard samples in exact sciences’ madison wisconsin laboratory when you joined the company how tough was it to bring everyone onboard for the required transition we had to build a brand new team and we had to convince wall street which had soured on exact sciences that a new approach was achievable and that the fundamental problem was solvable over time investors came to realize that this is a really important cancer screening test when we started our market cap in  was about  million and the company had  million in cash today the market cap is around a billion dollars and we have more than  million in cash this was a slow fiveyear process with the stock price going from  cents before we joined the company to more than  on february   and we have raised north of  million it hasn’t been easy but we have done something many people thought could not be achieved how close are you to finally achieving success our product is called cologuard in one of the largest colon cancer screening trials ever conducted –  patients – cologuard has been shown to detect  percent of patients with cancer all stages and  percent of two centimeter precancerous polyps as well as  percent of all precancerous polyps precancerous polyps typically take  to  years to develop into cancer so the idea is that with repeat testing – like with the pap smear which detects about  percent of advanced precancers – you can over time cull out and remove those precancerous polyps in a population which leads to disease prevention there are very few cancers where you can screen for precancers here you have the luxury of looking for a precancerous polyp that you can then remove the data is very clear colonoscopy has a huge effect on preventing cancer the problem with colonoscopy is that many people refuse to be screened with one the current noninvasive screening test only looks for blood and is not as accurate as cologuard we hope to displace other noninvasive tests so that people over the age of  will either undergo colonoscopy or use cologuard we believe that cologuard if fda approved will make a significant difference in screening patients for precancers and early cancers where you can make a difference has the industry come onboard to support this work it’s a disease where everyone wants to see better screening tools because it’s the most preventable yet least prevented of all cancers it typically takes  to  years to go from a small precancerous polyp to stage  cancer it takes another couple of years to go from stage  cancer to latestage metastasized cancer if we detect stage  cancer most of those patients won’t undergo chemotherapy – they will have surgery go home and lead a full life nine out of  earlystage cancers are cured  out of  latestage cancers result in death where do we stand today in terms of health care reform i strongly believe in the notion that all of our citizens should have access to decent health care i also believe that market forces could drastically bring down the cost of health care delivery and that we don’t have enough market forces at play today these mainly involve consumerism giving people access to prices and options for choosing a lower cost product or service will bring down the cost by giving the patient an incentive to look for the lower cost procedure you will see procedure cost come down today though most people who have health insurance don’t significantly care about the cost of any one service they get• click here to download a pdf of an interview with kevin t conroy president and chief executive officer exact sciences corp see other features from

conroy of exact sciences – building a better colon cancer test by lynn welch  nov    biotech health technology venture capital   comments madison – while kevin t conroy will not pursue a run for wisconsin governor the president and ceo of exact sciences corp nasdaq exas has turned his attention to growing exact sciences corp the company relocated to madison from the boston area just months after conroy was appointed to lead the medical diagnostics firm kevin t conroy conroy  is dedicated to leading exact science in developing a noninvasive homebased test for colon cancer that catches the disease early and is patientfriendly the screener is based on technology developed at the company over its  year history in a recent interview with wtn news conroy discussed how he’s steering exact sciences to develop its yet unnamed colon cancer test and bring it to trial in  wtn news tell us the key reasons you decided to move exact sciences from massachusetts to wisconsin kevin conroy we’ve had great success in wisconsin growing a molecular diagnostics company in the past with third wave technologies what we’ve found is we have great people in the state people who are very experienced scientists who are capable of developing these advanced diagnostics tests with these great people comes a tremendous network of other companies in the same industry to recruit from partner with and collaborate with we’ve also found that being so close to the university of wisconsin has been very very valuable also the cost of living here is lower there’s less traffic here and housing prices are lower here wtn news where is exact sciences at in its timeline for gaining government approval for its test kevin conroy we expect to be in clinical trials by the second or third quarter of  there have been a couple of different versions of this product on the market and there’s currently a version of the test offered by labcorp one of the large clinical lab companies in the country our version will be developed and taken thru fda trial development over the next year and a clinical trial would immediately follow that the clinical trial should take under a year to complete and submit to the fda because there other versions of the test there’s a whole lot of knowledge about what this test will look like we’re refining and redeveloping the test specifically because we know it is a highly reliable test wtn news why develop a test that has already been brought to market kevin conroy there have been challenges developing various versions of the test there have been technology improvements and new fundamental knowledge about the science of colon cancer that has helped dramatically improve the test results this is a test that not only has potential to save  lives a year in the us alone but has the ability to dramatically reduce health care costs and here’s why the burden on the health care system from  people developing colon cancer every year is massive some estimates have it over  billion spent in treating colon cancer in the us most of that is borne by medicare our best guess is that  percent of that cost is borne by medicare colon disease is for people who are of the age where health care is paid for by medicare there are way too many people dying of colon cancer and it’s costing this country too much with a simple patientfriendly test we can detect it before it becomes cancer remove it and the patient never develops cancer and by focusing it on in the precancer or early stage over time it’s possible to nearly eradicate the disease for example cervical cancer used to be the number one or two killer of women about  women a year died from the disease in s when our population was a lot less than it is now the pap test came along and last year fewer than  women died of cervical cancer and at least half of those that died were those that were not screened preventative medicine does dramatically alter outcomes wtn news how is your screener different kevin conroy current screeners don’t test very effectively colonoscopy is a wonderful test in terms of detecting precancers and cancers the problem with the colonoscopy is it’s not patient friendly and it’s very expensive as a result the compliance rate with the current gold standard for screening is low only  percent comply with screening standards in any given year this leads to results where  percent of cancers are detected in the late stage if you detect in stage one  percent of the time you’ll survive if detected in stage three you get a  percent fiveyear survival rate with stage four there’s an  percent survival rate that’s why this is so powerful if you have a simple screening test people will use this is the only patient friendly test in early stage wtn news have your efforts to develop this screener been affected by the global recession kevin conroy we’re not affected by the short term economy and have sufficient funds to build the test we need to build although we may raise more capital in the future we have  millionplus available today to deliver on our stated plans wtn news how are you building your company to achieve goals kevin conroy we have a wonderful team here i brought on dr graham lidgard a few months ago as chief science officer with  years experience in the diagnostics industry he built the blood stage test used to keep the blood supply safe in this country there are very few people with graham’s level of expertise dr barry berger is chief medical officer with the company he has really strong relationships with american cancer society and the fda and medicare and is a highly respected guy who will be overseeing the clinical trial and from the mayo clinic we have three researchers join us and dr dave ahlquist joined us as a consultant they are having a meaningful impact on the team here people were really drawn to the energy and focus that we have and the commitment we have to make the company successful you get to wake up every morning and go to work and know if you work really hard and do a good job you can have a major impact on a devastating cancer wtn news describe your leadership style kevin conroy my leadership style is focused on really believing in what you’re doing and the cause focus on a few really big things and try to do three or fewer big things to get everyone rallied around accomplishing those goals and then finally hold goals to high standards and hold the team accountable to high standards popular wisconsin could be big loser under senate healthcare plan outsourced cybersecurity
