distribution plan to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis the fund will distribute longterm capital gains andor return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution level investors should not draw any conclusions about the fund’s investment performance from the amount of the fund’s distributions or from the terms of the fund’s managed distribution plan the board of the fund may amend the terms of the plan or terminate the plan at any time without prior notice to the funds shareholders the amendment or termination of a plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the fund’s common shares the plan will be subject to periodic review by the board with each distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income the fund will issue a notice to shareholders and an accompanying press release which will provide detailed information regarding the amount and estimated composition of the distribution and other related information the amounts and sources of distributions reported above are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund’s investment experience during its full fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations the fund will send shareholders a form div for the calendar year that will tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes the fund may at times distribute more than its net investment income and net realized capital gains therefore a portion of the distribution may result in a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that shareholders invested in the fund is paid back to them a return of capital does not necessarily reflect a fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’ any such returns of capital will decrease the funds total assets and therefore could have the effect of increasing the funds expense ratio in addition in order to make the level of distributions called for under its plan the fund may have to sell
