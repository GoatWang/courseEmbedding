globalization apple’s onesizefitsall approach  brand quarterly friday july   facebook linkedin twitter globalglobalization apple’s onesizefitsall approach françoise hovivian dec  did you know that by the end of october  the iphone  and  plus were available in  countries and territories with a total of  countries planned by the end of the  that’s not the only amazing fact did you also know that the iphone is the same design regardless of regionapple did not customize their phone in terms of features and looks so you might think apple is taking the concept of “global” to the purist level using a one size fitsall approach with a standardized design across all regions the same range of products for all countries and no visible customization – also called localization – except for the power source pricing and carriers’ specificsthere are certain benefits to standardization and this one in particular establishing a global brand with a strong identity worked for apple however what about raising the idea that the standardization of apple products may in fact precisely answer the requirement for cultural understandingthe secret of any global brand success is cultural understanding the secret of any global brand success is cultural understanding what if apple has understood the underlying commonness of all humans so that noneed for product customization is actually the highest form of cultural understanding or what if apple has found the path to that sweetspot where there is a common ground among differing culturesthe thing is going global is not just about offering a product to several markets around the world it’s also about finding the denominator for a particular product that is regionblind apple i believe found this baseline purist – often called minimalist – approach with expansive usability testing steve jobs said “the main thing in our design is that we have to make things intuitively obvious”however apple concedes to personalization on several layers let’s examine what those areapple has stores all around the world for each of these stores apple follows a strict customer service protocol which is tailored to each region that creates insane loyalty and attachment because the local staff uses a personalized approach to communicate with customerseven the type of building matches the culture for example the paris apple store is housed in a haussmanntype building that is ideally suited to parisians’ tastes in architecture or at least what they have grown accustomed to bob bridger vice president of apple retail development explains what makes apple stores so popular “once a location is picked it’s all a matter of working towards making sure the store has an inviting appeal that matches its surrounding culture and environment it’s about ‘getting out into the street’ and feeling what the local feels”second of all apple chooses the countries where they are going to do business carefully  in fact for the first time in iphone history apple phones will be on track to be available in more than  countries by the end of the year  making this the largest iphone rollout ever talk about localization apple may use a one sizefitsall strategy for their products but that strategy allows them to launch in so many countries because they have minimal customization to subject their phones to but the area in which they choose personalization is their technical local requirementsthe new iphone  supports anywhere between  and  different lte longterm evolution bands depending on the model – which is the highest of any phone being currently sold that means you can use your usbought iphone  all over europe and asia with fast download speeds that is the epitome of a global experience tailored to the regional standards isn’t itthird the apple ecommerce web site is also purist and standard across all  world regions that the sites it is translated into and is a mirror of the brand it has the same look and feel regardless of the country you are viewing the site in but the content is highly customized in the local language transcreated or reviewed by local copywriters you find that same high translation quality in all of apple user guides and documentation even though apple’s userfriendly design approach makes the use of guides somewhat obsoletedid you know that apple isn’t on social media in fact apple customers constitute apple’s advertising – apple isn’t even involvedcustomers adapt to apple apple does not adapt to customers how and where do they get their customer pulse by being silent they let others do all the talking for them maybe that seeming lack of social marketing strategy is in fact the strategy customers come to apple apple creates the want and solidifies the brand in that way customers adapt to apple apple does not adapt to customers in  steve jobs told business week “a lot of times people don’t know what they want until you show it to them”lastly i will dare to say that apple is choosing not to adapt its products to the local culture because it does not need to apple is the culture this is the culture that people want to embrace when they wait in line at apple stores when they could just buy the product online people want to experience being a part of apple with its culture of hip fashion creativity personality and design apple creates the culture and customers become its embodiment apple has many detractors but in the end a successful brand is one that elicits powerful emotion and positive sentiment from its customers how many competitors of apple wouldn’t want to find the path to their customers’ hearts in a similar way françoise hovivianfrançoise is a senior vice president of global programs at valente a digital marketing consulting firm based out of

global strategy  quickmba  strategy  global strategy global strategic management during the last half of the twentieth century many barriers to international trade fell and a wave of firms began pursuing global strategies to gain a competitive advantage however some industries benefit more from globalization than do others and some nations have a comparative advantage over other nations in certain industries to create a successful global strategy managers first must understand the nature of global industries and the dynamics of global competition sources of competitive advantage from a global strategy a welldesigned global strategy can help a firm to gain a competitive advantage this advantage can arise from the following sources efficiency economies of scale from access to more customers and markets exploit another countrys resources  labor raw materials extend the product life cycle  older products can be sold in lesser developed countries operational flexibility  shift production as costs exchange rates etc change over time strategic first mover advantage and only provider of a product to a market cross subsidization between countries transfer price risk diversify macroeconomic risks business cycles not perfectly correlated among countries diversify operational risks labor problems earthquakes wars learning broaden learning opportunities due to diversity of operating environments reputation crossover customers between markets  reputation and brand identification sumantra ghoshal of insead proposed a framework comprising three categories of strategic objectives and three sources of advantage that can be used to achieve them assembling these into a matrix results in the following framework strategic objectives sources of competitive advantage national differences scale economies scope economies efficiency in operations exploit factor cost differences scale in each activity sharing investments and costs flexibility market or policyinduced changes balancing scale with strategic  operational risks portfolio diversification innovation and learning societal differences in management and organization experience  cost reduction and innovation shared learning across activities the nature of competitive advantage in global industries a global industry can be defined as an industry in which firms must compete in all world markets of that product in order to survive an industry in which a firms competitive advantage depends on economies of scale and economies of scope gained across markets some industries are more suited for globalization than are others the following drivers determine an industrys globalization potential cost drivers location of strategic resources differences in country costs potential for economies of scale production rd etc flat experience curves in an industry inhibits globalization one reason that the facsimile industry had more global potential than the furniture industry is that for fax machines the production costs drop  with each doubling of volume the curve is much flatter for the furniture industry and many service industries industries for which the larger expenses are in rd such as the aircraft industry exhibit more economies of scale than those industries for which the larger expenses are rent and labor such as the dry cleaning industry industries in which costs drop by at least  for each doubling of volume tend to be good candidates for globalization transportation costs valuebulk or valueweight ratio  diamonds and semiconductors are more global than ice customer drivers common customer needs favor globalization for example the facsimile industrys customers have more homogeneous needs than those of the furniture industry whose needs are defined by local tastes culture etc global customers if a firms customers are other global businesses globalization may be required to reach these customers in all their markets furthermore global customers often require globally standardized products global channels require a globally coordinated marketing program strong established local distribution channels inhibits globalization transferable marketing whether marketing elements such as brand names and advertising require little local adaptation world brands with nondictionary names may be developed in order to benefit from a single global advertising campaign competitive drivers global competitors the existence of many global competitors indicates that an industry is ripe for globalization global competitors will have a cost advantage over local competitors when competitors begin leveraging their global positions through crosssubsidization an industry is ripe for globalization government drivers trade policies technical standards regulations the furniture industry is an example of an industry that did not lend itself to globalization before the s because furniture has a high bulk compared to its value and because furniture is easily damaged in shipping transport costs traditionally were high government trade barriers also were unfavorable the swedish furniture company ikea pioneered a move towards globalization in the furniture industry ikeas furniture was unassembled and therefore could be shipped more economically ikea also lowered costs by involving the customer in the value chain the customer carried the furniture home and assembled it himself ikea also had a frugal culture that gave it cost advantages ikea successfully expanded in europe since customers in different countries were willing to purchase similar designs however after successfully expanding to several countries ikea ran into difficulties in the us market for several reasons different tastes in furniture and a requirement for more customized furniture difficult to transfer ikeas frugal culture to the us the swedish krona increased in value increasing the cost of furniture made in sweden and sold in the us stockouts due to the one to two month shipping time from europe more competition in the us than in europe country comparative advantages competitive advantage is a firms ability to transform inputs into goods and services at a maximum profit on a sustained basis better than competitors comparative advantage resides in the factor endowments and created endowments of particular regions factor endowments include land natural resources labor and the size of the local population in the s swedish economists eli hecksher and bertil ohlin developed the factorproportions theory according to which a country enjoys a comparative advantage in those goods that make intensive use of factors that the country has in relative abundance michael e porter argued that a nation can create its own endowments to gain a comparative advantage created endowments include skilled labor the technology and knowledge base government support and culture porters diamond of national advantage is a framework that illustrates the determinants of national advantage this diamond represents the national playing field that countries establish for their industries types of international strategy multidomestic vs global multidomestic strategy product customized for each market decentralized control  local decision making effective when large differences exist between countries advantages product differentiation local responsiveness minimized political risk minimized exchange rate risk global strategy product is the same in all countries centralized control  little decisionmaking authority on the local level effective when differences between countries are small advantages cost coordinated activities faster product development a fully multilocal value chain will have every function from rd to distribution and service performed entirely at the local level in each country at the other extreme a fully global value chain will source each activity in a different country philips is a good example of a company that followed a multidomestic strategy this strategy resulted in innovation from local rd entrepreneurial spirit products tailored to individual countries high quality due to backward integration the multidomestic strategy also presented philips with many challenges high costs due to tailored products and duplication across countries the innovation from the local rd groups resulted in products that were rd driven instead of market driven decentralized control meant that national buyin was required before introducing a product  time to market was slow matsushita is a good example of a company that followed a global strategy this strategy resulted in strong global distribution network companywide mission statement that was followed closely financial control more applied rd ability to get to market quickly and force standards since individual country buyin was not necessary the global strategy presented matsushita with the following challenges problem of strong yen too much dependency on one product  the vcr loss of nonasian employees because of glass ceilings a third strategy which was appropriate to whirlpool is one of mass customization discussed below global cost structure analysis in  whirlpool corporation was considering expanding into europe by acquiring philips major domestic appliance division from the framework of customers costs competitors and government there were several pros and cons to this proposed strategy pros internal components of the appliances could be the same offering economies of scale the cost to customize the outer structure of the appliances was relatively low the appliance industry was mature with low growth the acquisition would offer an avenue to continue growing cons fragmented distribution network in europe different consumer needs and preferences for example in europe refrigerators tend to be smaller than in the us have only one outside door and have standard sizes so they can be built into the kitchen cabinet in japan refrigerators tend to have several doors in order to keep different compartments at different temperatures and to isolate odors also because houses are smaller in japan consumers desire quieter appliances whirlpool already was the dominant player in a fragmented industry since philips had a relatively small market share in the european appliance market one must analyze the cost structure to determine if the acquisition would offer whirlpool a competitive advantage with the acquisition whirlpool would be able to cut costs on raw materials depreciation and maintenance rd and general and administrative costs these costs represented  of whirlpools cost structure compared to most other industries this percentage of costs that could benefit from economies of scale is quite large it would be reasonable to expect a  reduction in these costs an amount that would decrease overall cost by  doubling profits such potential justifies the risk of increasing the complexity of the organization because of the different preferences of consumers in different markets a purely global strategy with standard products was not appropriate whirlpool would have to adapt its products to local markets but maintain some global integration in order to realize cost benefits this strategy is known as mass customization whirlpool acquired philips major domestic appliance division  in  and the remainder in  initially margins doubled as predicted however local competitors responded by better tailoring their products and cutting costs whirlpools profits then began to decline whirlpool applied the same strategy to asia but ge was outperforming whirlpool there by tailoring its products as part of its multidomestic strategy globalizing service businesses service industries tend to have a flat experience curve and lower economies of scale however some economy of scale may be gained through knowledge sharing which enables the cost of developing the knowledge over a larger base also in some industries such as professional services capacity utilization can better be managed as the scope of operations increases on the customer side because a service firms customers may themselves be operating internationally global expansion may be a necessity knowledge gained in foreign markets can used to better service customers finally being global also enhances a firms reputation which is critical in service businesses high quality service products often depend on the service firms culture and maintaining a consistent culture when expanding globally is a challenge a good example of a service firm that experienced global expansion challenges is the management consulting firm bain  company inc in consulting a firms most important strategic asset is its reputation so a consistent firm culture is very important bain faced the following challenges which depend on the firms strategy and which affect the ability to maintain a consistent culture coordinating across offices and sharing knowledge whether to hire locals or international staff how to compensate modes of foreign market entry an important part of a global strategy is the method that the firm will use to enter the foreign market there are four possible modes of foreign market entry exporting licensing includes franchising joint venture foreign direct investment these options vary in their degree of speed control and risk as well as the required level of investment and market knowledge the entry mode selection can have a significant impact on the firms foreign market success issues in emerging economies in emerging economies capital markets are relatively inefficient there is a lack of information the cost of capital is high and venture capital is virtually nonexistent because of the scarcity of highquality educational institutions the labor markets lack well trained people and companies often must fill the void because of lacking communications infrastructure building a brand name is difficult but good brands are highly valued because of lower product quality of the alternatives relationships with government officials often are necessary to succeed and contracts may not be well enforced by the legal system when a large government monopoly eg a stateowned oil company is privatized there often is political pressure in the country against allowing the firm to be acquired by a foreign entity whereas a very large us oil company may prefer acquisitions because of the antiforeign sentiment joint ventures often are more appropriate for outside companies interested in newly privatized emerging economy firms knowledge management in global firms there is much value in transferring knowledge and best practices between parts of a global firm however many barriers prevent knowledge from being transferred barriers attributable to the knowledge source lack of motivation lack of credibility barriers attributable to the knowledge itself  ambiguity and complexity barriers attributable to the knowledge recipient lack of motivation not invented here syndrome lack of absorptive capacity  need prerequisite knowledge to advance to next level barriers attributable to the recipients existing process  process rigidity barriers attributable to the recipients external environment and constraints furthermore even when the transfer is successful there often is a temporary drop in performance before the improvements are seen during this period there is danger of losing faith in the new way of doing things to facilitate knowledge transfer a firm can implement processes to systematically identify valuable knowledge and best practices create incentives to motivate both the knowledge source and recipient develop absorptive capacity in the recipient  cumulative knowledge develop strong technical and social networks between parts of the firm that can share knowledge country management country managers must have the following knowledge knowledge of strategic management firmspecific knowledge countryspecific knowledge knowledge of the global environment country organizations can assume the role of implementor contributor strategic leader or black hole depending on the combination of importance of the local market and local resources strategic importanceof local market level of local resources  capabilities low high low implementor contributor high black hole strategic leader the least favorable of these roles is the black hole which is a subsidiary in a strategically important market that has few capabilities a firm can find itself in this situation because of company traditions ignorance of local conditions unfavorable entry conditions misreading the market excessive reliance on expatriates and poor external relations to get out of a black hole a firm can form alliances focus its investments implement a local rd organization or when all else fails exit the country country managers assume different roles the new country managers john a quelch professor of business administration harvard business school international structure country manager is a trader who implements policy multinational structure country manager plays the role of a functional manager with profit and loss responsibilities transnational structure country manager acts as a cabinet member team player since management control systems are standardized and decisionmaking power is shifted to the region manager the country manager develops the lead market in his country and transfers the knowledge gained to other similar markets global structure country manager acts as an ambassador and administrator in a global firm there usually are business directors who oversee marketing and sales the role of the country manager becomes one of a statesman this person usually is a local with good government contacts recommended reading bartlett christopher a and sumantra ghoshal managing across borders the
