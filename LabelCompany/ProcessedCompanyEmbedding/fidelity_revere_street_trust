under the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” any investment adviser to the funds will be registered under the advisers act  the prior order permits the funds to participate in a credit facility administered by fmr the “ifl program” the ifl program enables the funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels the ifl program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the funds and enhance the lending funds ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their shortterm balances the prior order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the ifl program the “ifl rate” be based on the average of a the higher of the overnight time deposit rate the “otd rate” and the funds current overnight repurchase agreement rate the “ficash rate”  and b a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the funds “benchmark rate” the board of trustees each a “fund board” and collectively the “fund boards” of each fund including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” as defined in section a of the act “independent trustees” establishes the benchmark rate and reviews no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the benchmark rate the benchmark rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the federal funds rate over the previous  days  applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary therefore applicants seek to amend the prior order to eliminate the use of the otd rate in the ifl rate calculation provided in conditions  and  “rate conditions” applicants also request an exemption from section a of the act applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person directly or indirectly if that person controls or is under common control with that company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person section a of the act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company” because the funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser that is under common control with those of the other funds applicants state that each fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other funds and therefore an affiliated person of those funds  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from selling securities or other property to the investment company section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  section f of the act prohibits registered openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank if immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” generally includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness  section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the act section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the commission rule db provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the companys participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting an exemption from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting an exemption from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a a and a of the act and d section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements the requested order would amend the rate conditions in the prior order and grant applicants an exemption from section a of the act  as noted previously applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary applicants state further that the ifl rate as amended would make it more likely that lending funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the ifl program if the ifl rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate applicants state that the rate conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity  applicants also state that the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions will not involve any potential that one fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another fund applicants state that under the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions rates will be set under a preestablished formula approved by the fund boards applicants state that all funds participating in the ifl program as revised by the rate conditions on any given day will receive the same interest rate  applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the rate conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the act and meet the standards set forth in sections c dj b and d of the act and rule d under the act applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the rate conditions would be reasonable and fair would not involve overreaching and would be consistent with the investment policies of the funds and with the general purposes of the act applicants submit further that each funds participation in the ifl program would be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and would be on a basis which is no different from or less advantageous than that of any other participant applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the ifl rate to be charged to the funds under the ifl program will be the average of a the ficash rate and b the benchmark rate  on each business day the cash management services department “cash management department” of fidelity service company inc will compare the ifl rate calculated as provided in condition  with the ficash rate that day and all shortterm borrowing rates quoted to any of the funds by any bank with which any fund has a loan agreement at least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any fund

right for you learn how to make out your rollover check and where to send it for deposit into your fidelity account faqs expand all collapse all what is a rollover ira a rollover ira is a traditional ira that is often used by those who have changed jobs or retired and have assets accumulated in their employersponsored retirement plan such as a k eligible distributions from such plans can be rolled over directly into a fidelity rollover ira without incurring any tax penalties and assets remain invested taxdeferred consolidating multiple employersponsored retirement plan accounts into a single rollover ira can make it easier to allocate and monitor your retirement assets what do i need to do to roll over my retirement plan assets to a fidelity ira a rollover takes three steps open the appropriate ira move your money to fidelity—to do this you will need to initiate a rollover from your former employer’s plan choose your investments in the rollover ira call  and a rollover specialist will help you every step of the way they can answer your questions plus help you initiate the distribution and complete any paperwork that may be required note that if you have an existing ira at fidelity you can roll your assets into that account see the next question can i roll over assets into my traditional ira yes you can but its important to be aware that if you do roll pretax k funds into a traditional ira you may not be able to roll those funds back into an employersponsored retirement plan contact your tax advisor for more information will i owe taxes on my rollover generally there are no tax implications if you complete a direct rollover and the assets go directly from your employersponsored plan into a rollover or traditional ira via a trusteetotrustee transfer however if you choose to convert some or all of your savings in your employersponsored retirement plan directly to a roth ira the conversion would be subject to ordinary income tax contact your tax advisor for more information if you withdraw the assets from your former employer‑sponsored retirement plan the check is made payable to you and taxes are withheld you may still be able to complete a day rollover within  days of receiving the distribution check you must deposit the money into a rollover ira to avoid current income taxes if taxes were withheld from the distribution you would have to replace that amount if you want to roll over your entire distribution to your fidelity ira if you hold the assets for more than  days your distribution will be subject to current income taxes and a  early withdrawal penalty if you are under age ½ can i move an existing ira from another institution to fidelity yes visit ira transfers for a quick overview of the online process what should i do if my former employers k was recordkept by fidelity if you would like to roll over a former employers retirement savings plan that is recordkept by fidelity please call a rollover specialist at  for assistance can i roll my money into a roth ira most people are eligible to convert their k to a roth ira however it is important to be aware of the potential tax implications if you have money in a designated roth k you can roll it directly into a roth ira without incurring any tax penalties however if the k funds are pretax then converting to a roth ira will be a taxable event nevertheless a conversion has the potential to help minimize future taxes and maximize retirement savings there are several factors to consider when deciding if converting to a roth ira may be right for you call fidelity for more information about converting your savings to a roth ira i already received a check made payable to me and  was withheld if i roll over my money now can i get that  back you’ll have to replace the  that was withheld with your own savings if you want to roll over your entire distribution to your fidelity ira—all within  days of receiving the distribution if you do the  that was withheld is credited toward your income tax liability when you file your tax return however if you don’t have the cash to make up for the  withheld the irs will consider that  as a distribution making it subject to taxes and a possible  early withdrawal penalty if you are under age ½ how do i know if i am eligible for a rollover generally there must be a distributable event the most common eligibility event is when an individual leaves the service of their employer other reasons may include attainment of age ½ death or disability please contact your plan to determine whether or not you are eligible for a distribution and therefore a rollover can i add more money to my ira later yes you can add money to your ira with either annual contributions or you can consolidate other former employersponsored retirement plan assets or iras some people choose to make their annual contributions to their ira so that they only have to keep track of one account this may be right for you if you have no desire to roll these assets back to a qualified retirement plan at a future employer assets can be commingled and still be eligible to roll into another employer plan in the future however it is at the discretion of the receiving plan to determine what type of assets can be rolled over can i leave my former employersponsored retirement plan assets in my current plan indefinitely no generally you must begin to take withdrawals known as required minimum distributions rmds from all your retirement accounts excluding roth iras no later than april  of the year following the year in which you turn age ½ check with your plan administrator to see if there are any other rules that may require the money to be taken out prior to you turning age ½ for example many plans require that accounts smaller than  be cashed out or rolled over learn more about rmds can i leave a portion of my k in an old employers plan and roll the remaining amount to an ira plans have different rules and requirements for k assets some k plans offer equal flexibility to both current and former employees while others place restrictions on withdrawal types and frequency for example some plans may allow partial withdrawals while others may require that you either leave all the funds in the plan or perform a full rollover or cash payout please check the plans rules for more information can i roll over my existing k assets into an ira while im still working generally you cannot roll over funds from your active k but there are some exceptions for example some plans allow for in service withdrawals at age ½ if you are under age ½ or if your plan does not have that withdrawal provision you may be able to withdraw or roll over specific types of contributions for example if in the past you rolled money directly from an old k into your current plan you may be able to move that money out of your plan into an ira can i roll over an old k that has both pretax and aftertax money in it you can but it is important to select the right ira for your needs a traditional or rollover ira is typically used for pretax assets because savings will stay invested on a taxdeferred basis and you wont owe any taxes on the rollover transaction itself however if you roll pretax assets into a roth ira you will owe taxes on those funds for aftertax assets your options are a little more varied you can roll the funds into a roth ira taxfree you also have the option of taking the funds in cash or rolling them into an ira along with your pretax savings if you choose the latter option it is important that you keep track of the aftertax amount so that when you start taking distributions youll know which funds have already been taxed irs form  is designed to help you do just this before making a decision please consult with a tax advisor about your specific situation if i leave my current employer can my vested participation in a defined benefit plan be rolled into an ira the answer depends on the rules of your defined benefit plan and the type of defined benefit plan defined benefit plans often called pension plans are qualified accounts meaning that they contain money that has not been taxed as income historically such plans do not allow this type of transfer until you officially retire whether or not you were an active employee at the time of retirement however as the workforce environment and irs rules have changed over time many pension plans now afford greater flexibility if your defined benefit plan offers the proper type of distribution you could roll it over to an ira or to a new employers plan if the plan allows you should check with your current employer to determine if they will accept a rollover of this type however before making a decision consider that a pension can be a great source of guaranteed income in retirement and should not be dismissed unless you have a specific plan for generating enough income without the pension payments what is net unrealized appreciation nua net unrealized appreciation is the difference between the price you initially paid for a stock its cost basis and its current market value when is a net unrealized appreciation nua strategy favorable for retirement plan participants who own employer stock that has grown in value from its original cost it may be beneficial to adopt an nua strategy for the employer stock generally from a tax perspective it is more favorable for participants to roll over their retirement plan assets to an ira or new employersponsored plan rather than take a lumpsum distribution however for participants who have large amounts of appreciated company stock it may be more beneficial to take a lumpsum distribution of company stock instead because it allows them to pay taxes now at a lower rate consult your tax advisor for more information hypothetical examples an individual owns  shares of company stock with a current fair market value of  an individual paid  per share for a cost basis of  an individuals net unrealized appreciation is   –  if an individual adopts an nua strategy and takes a lumpsum distribution of the employer stock he will owe income tax on the  assuming the participant is over age ½ and in the third highest federal income tax bracket  his or her federal income tax liability would be   times  in the year the stock is distributed inkind from the plan if he or she were to immediately liquidate the shares and assuming there were no further increases or decreases in share value then federal income taxes owed on the nua would be   x  there would be no  penalty on this nua regardless of the participants age if the individual elected to liquidate the stock in the plan and take a cash distribution or roll that stock over to a rollover ira and then withdraw the entire balance in cash the entire market value of the stock would be taxed at the federal level at the ordinary income tax rate in this example were assuming a  federal ordinary income tax rate on  for a hefty bill of  keep in mind that those taxes could go higher depending on your federal income tax bracket and any applicable early withdrawal penalties nua guidelines in order to qualify for nua you must meet all of the criteria listed below you must distribute your entire vested balance in your plan within one tax year though you dont have to take all distributions at the same time you must distribute all assets from all qualified plans you hold with the employer even if only one holds company stock you must take the distribution of company stock as actual shares you may not convert them to cash before the distribution not all companies allow in‑kind distributions so be sure to check whether its an option in your plan you must experience one of the following separation from service from the company whose plan holds the stock except in the case of selfemployed workers reaching age ½ total disability for selfemployed workers only death of course there are a number of other factors to consider before deciding to use nua treatment such as your overall capital gains situation your estate plan and charitable giving before taking any course of action a tax professional and financial advisor can help you determine whether the nua rule applies to your individual circumstances and if so how best to deploy it note the current tax rate is
