discontinue their use discover bank        andor one or more of its affiliates is involved in pending legal actions challenging its arbitration clause bills are periodically introduced in congress to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of predispute arbitration clauses and the doddfrank act authorized the cfpb to conduct a study on predispute arbitration clauses and based on the study potentially limit or ban arbitration clauses on march   the cfpb released its report to congress on predispute arbitration as required by the doddfrank act on october   the cfpb announced that it was considering proposing rules on arbitration agreements that would i effectively ban consumer financial companies from using arbitration clauses to prevent class action cases and ii require records of all other arbitrations to be provided to the cfpb for potential publication on its website the timing and provisions of any final rule are uncertain at this time discover bank and its affiliates are
