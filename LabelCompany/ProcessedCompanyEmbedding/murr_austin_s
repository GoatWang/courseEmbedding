andrew murr files legislation to relocate the public integrity unit  by rep murr andrew 00 austin today state representative andrew murr house district  filed a comprehensive bill to relocate the duties and responsibilities of the public integrity unit currently housed within the travis county district attorneys office to strengthen ethics enforcement in texas the public integrity unit as part of the travis county district attorneys office handles complaints and prosecutions involving state officials and employees in addition the legislature has delegated statewide jurisdiction to that office to prosecute insurance fraud and motor fuel tax cases murrs legislation would separate the texas public integrity unit from the travis county district attorney with oversight of the unit by a committee composed of the presiding judges of each of texas nine administrative judicial regions each regions presiding judge  typically a district judge or senior district judge  is appointed by the governor for a four year term the committee would supervise and oversee the unit and its director a qualified state prosecutor ensuring that appropriate policies are in place to maintain strong ethics and confidence in that office murr stated we expect our judicial branch of government to be sensible and avoid putting politics into play oversight of the unit by a committee composed of judges from around the state provides a competent and pragmatic approach in supervising a necessary infrastructure to maintain important ethics laws and transparency in our state government in 0 governor perry questioned the confidence he had in the travis county district attorney following her arrest and conviction for dwi he subsequently vetoed state funding for the unit since then the unit has remained partially funded using travis county taxpayer dollars the texas house of representatives base budget includes funding for the public integrity unit contingent upon its relocation away from the das office representative murr after meeting with representatives of the governors office speakers office and the office of court administration filed hb  governor abbott in his state of the state address proclaimed ethics legislation as one of five emergency items that he asked the legislature to give expedited attention murr explained the public has an expectation that texas have ethics laws in place to ensure that we operate state government in a transparent manner and hold those who do not follow our laws accountable for their conduct at the same time we do not want a system where politics and personalities inject distrust and skepticism into any prosecution with all the media attention surrounding the current status of the public integrity unit i want to make sure there is a viable and thoughtout plan in place to restore integrity in this process contact regan ellmer  contact info email capitol address district address room e po box 0 austin tx      fax  water street kerrville tx

our master bath remodel mike helped us make design decisions early on in the project which significantly improved the final result he was flexible and accommodating as we moved through the various

best prices the fact that he didn’t dictate suppliers or mark up materials made us very comfortable we came in under our budget and right on time he was very reliable and punctual and i would recommend him to others looking to remodel their homes brian betts austin txmike remodeled a bathroom for us last year we literally took the room down to the studs and replaced everything when he bid the job mike told me that he knew exactly waht we wanted – as it turned out he knew even better than we did he made several suggestions that really made a difference in the look of the room his

txmhm remodeling had remodeled our bathrooms to perfection so we knew that when we wanted our kitchen remodeled the only person to call was mike mhm since we knew first hand of the expert craftsmanship and attention to detail mike demands of his work it was a no brainer and sure enough we were not disappointed mike and his helper nick did an amazing job on our kitchen remodel he listened to what we wanted and had some great input of his own that was welcomed due to his many years of experience and vast knowledge of all facets of remodeling i think we worked well as a team which any remodel should be we also had to leave several times for different reasons and could completely trust mike and nick to put everything away and lock the house up if there is a better remodeler in austin or texas for that matter you would be hard pressed to find one better than mike at mhm remodeling diron and delissa keelingomg we love our bathroom it came out so much better than

fixtures and tub being the perfectionist he is fit right in with my husband’s personality everything mike did was perfect and the contractors he uses know they have to be perfect as well when things didn’t go quite as planned as some parts of a remodel always do he calmed us down and worked it all out we felt so comfortable with mike and his wonderful assistant that we even went on a trip right in the middle of everything it was fun to come back and see all the work that had been accomplished and one of the best things about using mike is that he’ll be there for us if we need anything in the

tackle our project mike  nick did an awesome job and the results speak for themselves we are very pleased with the outcome and all the material selections came together to transform the space that
