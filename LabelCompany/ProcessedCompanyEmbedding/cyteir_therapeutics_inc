fiscal year  cyteir therapeutics inc key developments cyteir therapeutics inc announces publication of preclinical in vivo data demonstrating jun   cyteir therapeutics inc announced the publication of preclinical in vivo data demonstrating that therapeutic targeting of the aidrad axis in b cells may block development of type  diabetes td in the june issue of the journal of immunology this work was carried out in collaboration with the jackson laboratory bar harbor maine and virginia tech blacksburg virginia cyteir’s approach leverages activation induced cytidine deaminase aid as both a biomarker and driver of dna damage by modulating the dna repair protein rad in aidpositive cells cyteir seeks to induce selective selfdestruction of cancer cells or specific bcells in autoimmune diseases preclinical studies to date have demonstrated cyteir’s early rad modulators to be potent selective for aidpositive cells effective against cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and well tolerated in preclinical animal models in autoimmune diseases aid is directly implicated in disease development and progression thus the use of a rad modulator may have utility in mitigating autoimmune diseases as exemplified in the data presented in the journal of immunology peer reviewed scientific article the preclinical data presented are from a series of experiments using nonobese diabetic nod mice a preclinical model of human type juvenile diabetes the study showed that treatment with a rad modulator which blocks the transport of rad into the nucleus of aid cells greatly reduced the incidence of td in these animals the study also found that targeting rad significantly increased cd b cells in the spleen pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreatic islets in treated mice these cells were capable of suppressing diabetogenic t cell responses thus enhancing the therapeutic effect of the rad targeted compound these results were achieved with intermittent and long term dosing which appeared well tolerated by the animals cyteir therapeutics presents preclinical data on use of dna repair modulators for lymphoid malignancies at american society of hematology annual meeting nov   cyteir therapeutics inc announced that it will present preclinical data elucidating a mechanism of cell death response that can be utilized to preferentially target lymphoid malignancies at the american society of hematology annual meeting in san diego california these data demonstrate that the dna mutase activation induced cytidine deaminase aid can be leveraged to effectively target aidexpressing cancers and has shown promise in a xenograft cancer model these exciting findings support the notion that modulation of the dna repair protein rad in aidexpressing malignancies could be an effective new therapeutic approach in oncology the results of these studies validate the promise of approach and provide momentum for the continued development of novel rad modulators for use in lymphoid cancers a program that the company plan to expand into solid tumor indications similar private companies by industry company name region n labs inc united states andme inc united states c tech

cyteir therapeutics is a leader in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics based on the biology of dna repair and synthetic lethality for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases our initial approach takes advantage of dna damage overload to induce selective selfdestruction of cells by targeting diseaseinduced rad transport synthetic lethalityby precisely modulating dna disease cells are overwhelmed by their own dna damage and undergo cell death radour lead program targets rad a dna repair protein that is important in cancer and autoimmune diseases cancerleveraging the synthetic lethal paradigm we are developing drugs for use in a range of cancer types autoimmune diseaseby precision targeting of specific dna repair proteins we aim to change the way many autoimmune diseases are treated technologycyteir has developed a screening technology to discover novel dna repair modulators that induce synthetic lethality in diseases with genetically defined gainoffunction abnormalities cancer there are newly discovered roles for dna repair in the development of autoimmune diseases precision targeting of dna repair mechanisms promises a differentiated synthetic lethal approach to treating a range of autoimmune disorders autoimmune cancer cells rely on dna repair for their survival their ablity for rapid and unrestricted growth and their capacity to rapidly mutate because dna repair is at the center of so many cancer processes synthetic lethality is a key to improving treatments for a wide range of cancers company▼company
